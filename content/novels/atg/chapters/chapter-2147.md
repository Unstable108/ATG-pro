As Dian Sansi’s initial shock faded, the flames of fury in his eyes actually dimmed slightly. The corners of his mouth even twitched, pulling into a warped, twisted smile.
 
Absurd. Far too absurd.
 
The Yun Che before him actually intended to face him—a Half-God in peak condition—with the cultivation of a mere fourth-level Divine Master. In his entire life, he had never heard such a preposterous joke.
 
A thread of suspicion crept into his heart... Could it be that Yun Che’s earlier behavior wasn't calculated provocation or malice, but that his brain simply wasn't working?
 
His lips moved slightly. Mimicking Yun Che’s earlier manner, he shaped his mouth to silently spit out four words:
 
*Id... iot... court... ing... death.*
 
Unfortunately, he possessed neither Yun Che’s sharpness nor his scheming depth. He thought he was being subtle, but given the caliber of the figures present, at least thirty percent saw it clearly.
 
In a battlefield exchange—and on the sacred Eden’s Crown no less—for the second strongest of the Boundless Kingdom’s younger generation to sneak in such unprovoked, petty insults was undoubtedly low-class. It made people look down on him.
 
Quite a few gazes directed towards turned strange. Dian Luohou’s brows furrowed deeply.
 
“This bastard!” Dian Luohou could not hold it in; he cursed in a low voice, hating iron for failing to become steel. “No matter how intense your anger, you absolutely do not vent it on others. Once this fight is over, I’ll have to drag him over to apologize.”
 
“...” Dian Jiuzhi maintained a surface calm and nodded in agreement.
 
Just then, Dian Sansi made a move that caused everyone to stare.
 
He placed his right hand behind his back, slowly raised his left hand, and held it horizontally in front of him.
 
It was the exact posture of the ten-breath “concession” Dian Jiuzhi had made when fighting Shenwu Yi.
 
The difference was that he took it to a greater extreme than Dian Jiuzhi. On that raised left hand, only a single little finger was slowly extended open.
 
Although Dian Jiuzhi had ultimately lost to Shenwu Yi, his ten breaths of pure defense were displayed when he knew he held the absolute advantage; it was a gentlemanly bearing without flaw.
 
But Dian Sansi mimicking it now only drew deep frowns.
 
That single extended little finger was nothing short of naked contempt.
 
Veins bulged on Dian Luohou’s forehead. “This bastard! Did a donkey kick his head today!? This is simply... a clumsy, ugly display!”
 
He was furious, wishing he could rush onto the battlefield, grab his son by the collar, and slap him senseless.
 
“Divine Regent, please quell your anger.” A Boundless Elder offered comfort. “Sansi’s character is absolutely not like this. It is just that... with Jiuzhi’s defeat, he is the most distressed. He is young, after all, and prone to losing emotional control. It is somewhat excusable; just discipline him strictly upon return.”
 
Dian Sansi believed himself calm, but in truth, he was half-out of control. When rationality is drowned by surging negativity that must be forcibly suppressed, doing anything contrary to one's nature is not surprising.
 
He stared at Yun Che, his voice still fairly cool. “My Boundless Kingdom disdains bullying the weak. I will grant you ten breaths. I will only defend, not attack!”
 
Yun Che smiled. “Brother Sansi’s generosity, I appreciate deeply. Since that is the case, I naturally prefer compliance to deference.”
 
The moment the words fell, he leapt into the air, charging straight at Dian Sansi. His profound energy surged violently, and he threw a plain, mediocre punch.
 
The aura of a fourth-level Divine Master. No tricks, no flukes. It greatly disappointed those secretly hoping for an “accident,” leaving them with no illusions.
 
How could the power of a mere Divine Master pose even a shred of threat to Dian Sansi? He stared straight at Yun Che’s approach, the contempt and disdain on his face unconcealed.
 
That raised little finger curled down halfway; only then did it leisurely move to meet Yun Che’s seemingly full-powered right punch.
 
The profound energy flowing over his body did not even amount to ten percent.
 
But the instant finger and fist touched, Dian Sansi caught a trace of mockery in Yun Che’s eyes.
 
**Rumbling Heaven!**
 
In that single instant, Yun Che’s aura exploded with a magnitude that no one had anticipated, nor could even imagine. The surging blast waves instantly displaced the air within the entire battlefield barrier, whipping up sky-filling ripples of sonic force.
 
Dian Sansi’s pupils dilated tenfold. Within them, he saw his own little finger snap at a horrifying angle.
 
That fist, carrying colossal force, did not lose a shred of momentum after shattering the finger; it smashed straight into his chest. Half the fist sank deep into his flesh.
 
BOOM!!
 
A profound energy detonation far exceeding expectations rang out, accompanied by Dian Sansi’s instinctive, throat-tearing scream.
 
His body flipped and flew backward, soaring a full hundred meters before he finally regained his senses. He hastily released his profound energy and crashed heavily to the ground.
 
He clutched his violently trembling left hand; the broken little finger dangled limply, while his face displayed bewildered panic... and a terrifying hideousness.
 
A deathly silence filled the surroundings, followed abruptly by an eruption of noise.
 
One by one, powerhouses who looked down upon the Abyss gaped, mouths open and eyes bulging; the extreme shock distorted their features.
 
The Boundless Divine Regent’s eyes widened into saucers; the Star Moon Divine Regent’s gaze remained frozen; the Pray Eternal Divine Regent leaned forward; even the Dreamless Divine Regent’s eyes twitched violently.
 
“This... this... this...” Meng Jianxi had prepared himself mentally, yet he still stammered in speechlessness.
 
Behind the Chief High Priest, Divine Attendant Dong Juang could not dispel the astonishment in his heart. “Master, his cultivation... is it concealed?”
 
The Chief High Priest spoke in a heavy voice, “Even the most brilliant concealment cannot escape my eyes. He is indeed at the fourth level of the Divine Master Realm. But in that instant just now... he unleashed a might comparable to the first level of the Divine Extinction Realm.”
 
This scene completely shattered his cognition, even as the Chief High Priest.
 
Divine Attendant Dong Huang opened his mouth but found himself speechless.
 
The Chief High Priest seemed to mutter to himself, “I just do not know if that was only a momentary burst of strength, or perhaps...”
 
His gaze locked onto Yun Che. Even during the Battle of the Divine Sons, his focus had never been this sharp.
 
Gasps filled the air, but Dian Sansi presented nothing but wretchedness—in both expression and physique.
 
“You...” Shock, fury, and humiliation overlapped chaotically within him. Responding to him was Yun Che’s figure, surging close once more.
 
This time, how would Dian Sansi dare to be arrogant? The **Boundless Myriad Manifestations Art** circulated at extreme speed, coating his body in a layer of heavy silver radiance... directly releasing fifty percent of his profound strength.
 
Three breaths ago, he never would have dreamed he would need half his strength to deal with a fourth-level Divine Master.
 
*Bang!*
 
With a dull thud, Yun Che’s fist smashed onto Dian Sansi’s chest once again. But this time, the tyrannical Boundless force completely resisted the power, refusing to let him be forced back even half a step.
 
However, this stalemate lasted only for a single instant before Dian Sansi once again saw a deeper mockery in Yun Che’s eyes.
 
**Hell Monarch!**
 
BOOM!
 
Like a slumbering volcano suddenly awakening and erupting in his chest, the silver radiance flowing on Dian Sansi’s body collapsed. His chest caved in even more dramatically than before, and the sound of shattering ribs cracked as loud as a collapsing mountain.
 
“Wh... What!?” Countless composed powerhouses lost their voices on the spot.
 
Some young profound practitioners nearly smashed their chins on the ground.
 
Amidst the sickening sound of crushing bones, Dian Sansi—who had clearly released fifty percent of his power—was blasted away again. Yun Che’s figure followed like a shadow, relentless.
 
Dian Sansi did not wait to stabilize his body mid-flight. With a violent, venting roar, the scattered silver radiance suddenly blazed around him, carrying an endless, manic pressure. This time, the **Boundless Myriad Manifestations Art** operated at full force without reservation.
 
The alarming shockwaves and spiritual pressure visibly slowed Yun Che’s momentum. At this moment, Dian Sansi had already flipped upright in mid-air. Silver radiance transformed into a blade in his hand, stabbing straight toward Yun Che’s heart.
 
“Brother Yuan!” Meng Jianxi cried out in alarm; the entire Dreamweaver faction erupted in panic, faces pale with horror.
 
Dian Sansi, who had proudly declared a ten-breath concession, had suddenly counterattacked... and in a state of full, explosive power.
 
Even if Yun Che’s explosive force transcended the Divine Master Realm, his body was still that of a Divine Master. How could he endure the full-force strike of a Half-God?
 
*Riiip!*
 
The light blade carved continuous spatial ripples, but it only tore apart Yun Che’s afterimage. However, Dian Sansi’s momentum did not stagnate; the silver radiance instantly transformed into a blade three thousand meters long, slashing horizontally with no mercy.
 
Cries of alarm overlapped with the terrifying sound of rending. A massive silver scar, three kilometers long, was gouged into the battlefield. Yun Che, however, trod the steps of **Moon Splitting Cascade**; with several consecutive ghost-like flickers, he appeared at the other end of the battlefield, completely unscathed.
 
“Phew...” Only then did Meng Jianxi let out a long breath, followed by a gnashing of his teeth. “Dian Sansi has gone crazy!”
 
“Hah!” Dian Luohou exhaled sharply and roared, “Bastard! Have you gone mad!?”
 
The violent roar was like a bucket of ice water dumped over Dian Sansi’s head, shocking him partially awake. He froze.
 
If he had been careless just now and killed Yun Che in public, the consequences...
 
The thought turned his blood to ice.
 
But how could Yun Che let him regain his cool?
 
The smile on Yun Che’s face, previously quite genial, had turned into a cold sneer—three parts ice, seven parts mockery. “I have often heard that Boundless practitioners value honor and promises above all, their words carrying an enormous weight. Brother Sansi swore just now to concede ten breaths, purely defending. Not even three breaths have passed, yet you shattered your promise... and even launched a sneak attack! Heh, Brother Sansi’s integrity is truly eye-opening!”
 
No one found Yun Che’s change of face strange, nor would anyone criticize his merciless shouting.
 
Dian Sansi’s various faces were on display; he had volunteered the ten-breath concession himself. That near-manic, vicious counterattack was seen clearly by everyone. Even a saint would explode in fury on the spot.
 
“This bastard thing!” Veins crawled across Dian Luohou’s forehead. He was not angry at Yun Che, but at Dian Sansi... In his shame, he could not even meet the Dreamless Divine Regent’s gaze.
 
Dian Sansi turned his head, meeting a field full of disdain.
 
The emotions that had just cooled by thirty percent were instantly swallowed by humiliation ten times greater.
 
His breathing became rough, his chest heaving as if about to explode.
 
*Clearly, everything is Yun Che’s fault... clearly, Yun Che’s face and words in private were so ugly and venomous...*
 
*Why is it I who bears such gazes? Why have I become the villain looked down upon!*
 
*Why is such a despicable person the Dreamweaver Divine Son? How could he make the Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter abandon Brother Jiuzhi? How can he explode with such impossible power at the Divine Master Realm...*
 
*Why... On what basis...*
 
Meeting his chaotic gaze, Yun Che slowly raised his hand, his voice cold and hard. “Brother Sansi could have gone all out from the start. Since I, Yun Che, dare to fight, then victory or defeat... even life and death, depend entirely on my own fate. But acting like this... Brother Sansi is simply too low-class. It is contemptible.”
 
“Heh... Hehehe.” Dian Sansi began to laugh, a sound strange even to his own ears. “Good... very good. All out, entirely on one’s own fate. This is what... *you* said yourself!”
 
The instant his voice fell, the five fingers of his right hand clawed the void. Five silver light arrows shrieked through the air, shooting straight at Yun Che.
 
At the same time, the silver radiance on his body gathered toward his right arm, blossoming into a sphere of profound silver light.
 
The five arrows of light arrived in a sequence of different speeds. Yun Che swayed slightly, leaving behind five afterimages that evaded every arrow... But the instant the last afterimage dissipated, Dian Sansi pounced, carrying pressure as heavy as a collapsing mountain.
 
“Boundless Myriad Manifestations... **Great Rage Swallows the Stars**!”
 
The tyrannical Boundless power condensed in his right arm, blasting straight toward Yun Che’s heart. Clearly, he intended to pay back a hundredfold the two punches Yun Che had landed earlier.
 
The might Dian Sansi released seemed to pin Yun Che in place. He did not attempt to retreat; instead, he swung his right hand. Golden flames exploded in his palm, meeting the attack head-on.
 
RUMBLE!!
 
Like a thousand thunderclaps detonating on Eden’s Crown, the Boundless power and the golden flames exploded simultaneously. Dense silver radiance and blazing fire submerged both figures.
 
Everyone’s pupils were filled by silver and gold. Eyes already wide expanded further, on the verge of bursting from horror.
 
This was Dian Sansi’s full strength, without a shred of reservation. Yet it was completely withstood from the front by Yun Che... with the power and body of a fourth-level Divine Master... without retreating half a step!
 
The impact of this image was beyond the description of any language.
 
Shenwu Yi defeating Dian Jiuzhi across two minor realms had shocked the Divine Regents. But at this moment, they were enduring a total collapse of their understanding of reality.
 
*Gulp!*
 
Sha Xing and Xian Yue swallowed violently at the same time.
 
Dian Jiuzhi stood dazed. He had witnessed Yun Che’s action personally and estimated his limits. Yet at this moment, he was shocked beyond words.
 
“This... this can’t be real, right?” Pan Buzhuo murmured, his soul lost.
 
In Shenwu Yi’s moon-like eyes, there was only golden fire, no silver radiance.
 
Her gaze fell into that strange haziness again... taking a full breath before returning to clarity.
 
The Chief High Priest whispered, “Golden Crow Flame...”
 
Within the silver radiance and golden flames, Dian Sansi and Yun Che’s fists were locked, their gazes inches apart.
 
One face was hideous, veins bulging; the other smiled faintly, composed and idle.
 
Dian Sansi’s pupils were covered in terrifying bloodshot lines. His arm trembled, Boundless Divine Power surging madly, yet he could not force Yun Che back by a single inch.
 
Then, Yun Che’s pupils flickered with a strange silver brilliance.
 
This ripple of soul power was easily captured by the powerhouses. They instantly recognized it as the core art of the Dreamweaver Kingdom, the first realm of the “Dreamweaver Divine Canon”—**Splendid Dream of Youth**.
 
As the Dreamweaver Divine Son, using the Dreamweaver Divine Canon during battle was perfectly normal.
 
But this first-realm soul skill was weak. It was difficult to suppress a practitioner of the same realm, let alone a mere Divine Master soul trying to suppress a Half-God.
 
Unless... his soul, like his impossible strength and body, could also release might comparable to the Divine Extinction Realm?
 
Under normal circumstances, Dian Sansi would have guarded against the Dreamweaver Divine Canon immediately.
 
But right now, he could barely control himself; how could he mount a defense?
 
The “Splendid Dream of Youth” entered his soul sea like a spark dropped silently into a cauldron of boiling oil.
 
Under the cover of the Golden Crow flames, Yun Che’s lips moved slightly:
 
*Idiot. Go back to being a spineless coward.*
 
Dian Sansi’s pupils detonated.
 
And the flames on Yun Che’s body erupted.
 
**God... Ash!**
 
BOOM-HUM!
 
The Golden Crow shrieked to the heavens; flames blanketed the sky.
 
In an instant, the silver radiance was devoured by fire. A burning figure flew out of the conflagration at extreme speed, trailing a wretched scream that filled the sky.
 
“WAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!”
 
The scream was so shrill that the hearts of the young profound practitioners convulsed. The burning figure streaked across thousands of meters of sky in a flash, smashing through the barrier.
 
Dian Luohou raised his hand; a stream of profound energy swept his son down from mid-air, slamming him heavily onto the ground. The golden flames were extinguished instantly.
 
His movements were rough, his anger heavy. But as the flames vanished, the wretched state of Dian Sansi choked the curses in Dian Luohou’s throat.
 
His clothes had turned to ash. His skin was scorched black, half his hair was gone, and his face was unbearably tragic.
 
Though not a fatal injury, presenting such an ugly state in public—added to today’s performance—meant his reputation was not just destroyed; it was stained forever.
 
“Fa... cough... cough cough...”
 
He opened his mouth, but coughed out mouthfuls of black smoke. Ugly and comical; clearly, even his windpipe had been scorched.
 
He felt the gazes from the surroundings change from disdain to... a pity a thousand times more terrifying than disdain.
 
At this moment, the Chief High Priest’s proclamation rang out:
 
“Dian Sansi of the Boundless Kingdom has left the barrier. Meng Jianyuan of the Dreamweaver Kingdom wins.”
 
A tide of sound rose. Shouts of shock and gasps of admiration rose and fell, a cruel contrast to his misery.
 
The world spun before Dian Sansi’s eyes. He heard the sound of his soul snapping.
 
He propped his body up. All his conviction and will turned into a heart-tearing, lung-splitting roar:
 
“Abyssal Monarch! Father God! Yun Che, he—”
 
“Sansi!” Dian Jiuzhi paled in shock, pouncing to clamp a hand over his mouth.
 
But Dian Sansi, who usually obeyed Dian Jiuzhi, exploded with shocking strength. He violently threw off the hand and continued to roar, his voice hoarse as a despairing ghost:
 
“Yun Che and Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter Hua Caili are illicitly entangled! I saw it with my own eyes! With my own eyes!!”
