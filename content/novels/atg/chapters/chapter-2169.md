"Lass Caili has arrived. Then this boy must be Yun Che?"

An old, placid voice drifted over. Yun Che followed the sound and saw a serene figure seated atop a high platform constructed from exotic wood and abyssal crystals. He wore a simple grey robe, his frame tall and slender, his hair and beard half-white. His features were touched by age but could still be described as handsome. His downward gaze was gentle, yet his eyes held no warmth. His demeanor carried no deliberate majesty, yet Yun Che felt a faint sense of pressure that seeped straight into his soul. Moreover, this formless spiritual pressure felt deeply familiar.

Yun Che's gaze narrowed slightly. This man was one of the four Divine Officers of the Pure Land, the Myriad Dao Divine Officer who managed its resources. To guard the Myriad Dao Divine Pavilion, with its boundless aura and astonishing reserves, one would undoubtedly have to be exceedingly strict and cautious.

Yun Che bowed respectfully, neither servile nor arrogant. "Junior Yun Che of the Dreamweaver Divine Nation pays his respects to the Myriad Dao Divine Officer."

"Mm."

The Myriad Dao Divine Officer gave a faint nod, a smile on his face that did not reach his eyes. "Indeed, your looks and bearing are both extraordinary. For Caili to have given her heart to you... you've certainly gotten the better end of the deal, boy."

Yun Che: "?"

The words sat uncomfortably with Yun Che, but given the other party's status, he showed no sign of it.

"Grandpa Wandao!"

Hua Caili looked up at him, her smile radiant. "What ancient tome are you studying today?"

"Hehe."

The Myriad Dao Divine Officer chuckled leisurely, speaking in a casual tone. "No matter how ancient the tome, it cannot be older than your Grandpa Wandao. These are just some mortal curiosities with occasional merits. For instance, where an unusual abyssal crystal was unearthed, or where a beautiful young lady has blossomed, tsk."

Hua Caili pursed her lips in a teasing manner. "I heard from Uncle Liuxiao that you've probably touched nearly a million women in your lifetime. You're an old grandpa now, yet you still haven't shed these strange inclinations."

Yun Che: "..."

The Myriad Dao Divine Officer's eyes narrowed slightly. "I savor all of the myriad daos; how could women be excluded? However, this World of Abyssal Dust is far too sullied, and true spiritual charm is hard to find. What's a million of them? Compared to you and your aunt, they are but a pile of barely palatable mortal flesh. And all the most exquisite flesh in history has come from the Divine Nations. A pity, what a pity."

An almost imperceptible frown creased Yun Che's brow before smoothing out instantly.

"There you go again with your strange talk," Hua Caili muttered under her breath.

The Myriad Dao Divine Officer's gaze returned to the scroll before him, his voice utterly casual. "I have received a sound transmission from the Abyssal Emperor. You may choose any one of the profound artifacts¹ here."

As his words fell, the world before Yun Che's eyes suddenly flipped. When space stabilized again, the vast, majestic scene from before had been replaced by a heart-stopping, soul-shaking sharpness and baleful aura. It was as if countless ferocious beasts, dormant for millennia, had suddenly awakened. Endless killing intent and baleful energy erupted from every corner of the world, instantly transforming the entire space into a terrifying domain of slaughter woven from razor-sharp edges.

Profound artifacts filled his vision, stretching to the horizon.

Though unsheathed and their heavenly might unreleased, they already caused the surrounding air to crackle and pop, and even space itself rippled with fine fissures. Endless baleful energy converged into rivers, flowing slowly throughout the divine pavilion.

As if just realizing something, Yun Che spoke with a mix of surprise and gratitude, "So... Caili, you used the Abyssal Emperor's boon to choose a new weapon for me?"

"Mhm!"

Hua Caili's smile bloomed, her eyes shimmering like crushed diamonds, their light filled with Yun Che's reflection. "Without Master's Yunli Sword, Elder Brother Yun is missing a part of Master's companionship. Although... although I don't dare compare myself to your master, I want..."

Yun Che suddenly reached out, his fingertip gently touching her soft lips, silencing the rest of her words. "Silly girl. Master has passed, but she will forever be in my heart. And you are not only in my heart but also by my side. There has never been any comparison to be made."

Hua Caili's gaze froze for a moment, and then her smile blossomed completely, so pure and bright it outshone the clearest celestial light in the Pure Land's dome.

On the distant high platform, the Myriad Dao Divine Officer let out a sneer only he could hear. "Sweet nothings."

Hua Caili took Yun Che's hand and stepped forward with great care. "Uncle Abyssal Emperor said that as long as it's something you like, you can take it, no matter which one it is. Even if Grandpa Wandao is reluctant, he can't stop you. But, the Artifact Pavilion is filled with a terrifying baleful aura that can invade the mind and disturb the soul. You must isolate yourself with profound energy before stepping inside."

As she spoke, a faint sword light flashed in her eyes, and she erected an exquisite domain of sword energy around herself.

Yun Che's expression, however, remained unchanged. He made no move. Just as he was about to step into the Artifact Pavilion, the Myriad Dao Divine Officer's emotionless voice sounded in his ear, "Boy, defend yourself with profound energy. The baleful aura here is not something a junior like you can withstand."

"Thank you for the reminder, Senior." Yun Che replied courteously but still did not release the slightest bit of profound energy. Instead, he strode forward directly into the terrifying domain of balefulness woven by the ten thousand artifacts before him.

Hua Caili subconsciously reached out to pull him back, but her hand retracted midway. The vicious balefulness of the myriad artifacts here was indeed beyond what an ordinary person could bear, but how could her man be compared to an ordinary person?

With a single step forward, the already dense baleful aura suddenly congealed like lead. Walking into it was like having ten thousand mountains pressing down on him, making it difficult to breathe. Countless sinister energies pierced through his profound defenses like needles, penetrating his flesh and bringing a bone-deep chill, which then ignited a violent, searing pain deep within his marrow, as if two ultimate forces were viciously battling and tearing each other apart inside his body.

Compared to the physical pressure, the assault on his soul was even more terrifying. His five senses were instantly distorted. His vision grew dim and hazy, and the air smelled of metallic rust and decay, as if he were inhaling not air, but the deathly miasma steamed from millions of withered bones.

The darkness in his heart was wildly stirred up, and crazed thoughts of slaughter and destruction surfaced uncontrollably. It was as if his body had been possessed by countless vicious souls, his sanity gradually nearing collapse amidst the violence. This was the sinister balefulness and killing intent accumulated by countless profound artifacts over millions of years. To withstand it, one relied less on cultivation and more on experience... or rather, on the frenzied malevolence and blood of living beings that one's heart had experienced and body had been stained with!

One step... two steps... ten steps...

Yun Che walked slowly through the domain, his gaze sweeping over one profound artifact after another. His face was impassive, his breathing even. He strolled as if in a courtyard, admiring elegant objects.

"Hm?" The Myriad Dao Divine Officer slowly turned his head, his gaze focusing on Yun Che for the first time.

"Elder Brother Yun, are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?" Hua Caili followed by his side, her eyes holding three parts concern and seven parts wonder.

Yun Che, however, smiled faintly and said calmly, "No matter how strong or fierce the aura of a profound artifact, it is ultimately a masterless, dead object. Only when it meets its master does it gain life. If you revere it, it will push its advantage. If you view it with contempt as a dead thing, then it is merely a dead thing. What right does it have to inspire fear?"

"Oh..."

Hua Caili seemed to only half-understand, but starlight of adoration once again lit up her eyes. "As expected of Elder Brother Yun. Now that you put it that way... the baleful aura here really doesn't seem so scary anymore."

Yun Che's steps suddenly halted. His gaze tilted downward, landing on a faint grey shadow in a bottom corner.

It was a greatsword, entirely grayish-white and unadorned. Any artifact that could exist here was extraordinary.

The "Eternal Rock" on Mo Beichen, which had once pushed him into a desperate situation, had likely come from this place. Their auras and divine glimmers were all incredibly potent, either to display their might, repel living beings, or attract a master.

But this grayish-white greatsword released not a shred of sword light or sword might. Instead, it hid itself in the most cramped and lightless corner, so much so that its existence was barely noticeable amidst the boundless power of the surrounding artifacts. Its presence was completely at odds with the world around it, possessing only a lightless, endless solitude.

Yun Che reached out and grasped the grayish-white hilt, his palm coated with a thick layer of ancient dust. He tightened his five fingers and lifted his arm... but the grey sword did not budge in the slightest.

"Eh?"

Hua Caili's lips parted in surprise. "Elder Brother Yun, you're not going to..."

Voom—

Profound energy erupted from Yun Che's body as he activated the Heretic God's Yama Emperor gate. With a sudden explosive sound, he slowly dragged the heavy grey sword up from the ground and stood it before him, creating a thunderous metallic clang that made a slightly startled Hua Caili subconsciously cover her ears.

He tightened his grip again, slowly bringing the sword horizontal before his chest. Then, he turned his gaze to the Myriad Dao Divine Officer and said in a clear voice, "May I ask Senior Wandao, what is this sword's name?"

The Myriad Dao Divine Officer replied faintly, "This sword was not forged in the Pure Land. It was likely obtained from the God-Sleep Forbidden Domain in a distant era. Its origins are unknown. Besides being unusually heavy, it contains no divine aura and has not birthed a sword spirit. No one has ever paid it any mind, so it has never been named. If it hadn't been long forgotten, it would have been melted down into raw material for forging."

Evidently, if Yun Che hadn't picked it up today, the Myriad Dao Divine Officer would have even forgotten that such a spiritless, nameless sword still remained here.

These words would have been enough for anyone else who entered this place to discard it without a second thought. But Yun Che held the sword, turned around, and didn't spare the endless Artifact Pavilion another glance. "In that case, this is the one."

"..." The Myriad Dao Divine Officer narrowed his eyes, his expression inscrutable.

Though surprised, Hua Caili readily trusted Yun Che's choice. "Alright. Since it doesn't have a name yet, Elder Brother Yun can give it one."

Yun Che looked at its grayish-white blade and slowly uttered two words: "Lone... Cloud."

"..." Li Suo looked as if she wanted to speak but stopped herself.

BOOM!!

Fierce flames ignited on the sword's body. A surging heatwave instantly dispersed the surrounding killing intent and baleful aura, causing countless profound artifacts to hum in response.

"From this day forward, you will be my companion, no longer a nameless, lonely sword forgotten in this place!"

The flaming sword body trembled and buzzed. The long-silent blade released a heavy might, as if this spiritless greatsword was trying its utmost to respond to him.

"Lone... Cloud..."

Hua Caili murmured the name, tilting her head slightly as she said earnestly, "It's best that a sword named by Elder Brother Yun has the character 'Yun' in it. But why 'Lone Cloud'? With me here, I'll never let Elder Brother Yun be lonely."

Yun Che lowered his gaze slightly, looking into the girl's pure eyes. "'Lone' doesn't just mean lonely. It also symbolizes being unique and irreplaceable in all of heaven and earth!!"

He leaned in close to Hua Caili's ear and whispered, "Even your Uncle Abyssal Emperor refers to himself as 'the lone one'²."

Hua Caili understood at once. "I get it. Mmm! My Elder Brother Yun is, of course, truly unique in all of heaven and earth."

The Myriad Dao Divine Officer's lips twitched, and he let out another faint sneer. "This little girl can even feed herself love potions. A pity, what a pity."

He spoke up, "The artifacts you have seen are not even a ten-thousandth of this pavilion's collection. Once you step out of this place, there will be no chance to change your mind. Boy, are you certain?"

"Since this junior has made his choice, there is no need to change it."

Yun Che's reply was without a hint of hesitation. He put away Lone Cloud, took Hua Caili's hand, and walked out of the Artifact Pavilion. Then, he bowed from a distance. "This junior's wish has been fulfilled. We will intrude no longer. Farewell."

If it had been any other Divine Officer, he might have tried to get closer. But this Myriad Dao Divine Officer, despite his peaceful appearance and gaze, made him feel uneasy.

"Mm, you may go then."

The Myriad Dao Divine Officer responded casually, his eyes on his scroll. From beginning to end, he never descended from his high platform.

"Grandpa Wandao, we're leaving! We'll come see you next time we're in the Pure Land. Oh, and I haven't thanked you for the Liyun Sword yet!"

The Myriad Dao Divine Officer did not look up, speaking faintly, "It was not I who gave you the Liyun Sword, but the Liyun Sword that chose you. After you left last time, it trembled incessantly, wailing day and night, so I tossed it to your aunt. To find a compatible master is your good fortune and its destiny. There is no need for thanks."

As he spoke, he casually pressed his palm down. The space of the divine pavilion flipped once more, concealing the Artifact Pavilion in an unknown void. In that instant, as his hand descended, Yun Che caught a faint golden glint flash in the depths of his eyes.

Suddenly, Yun Che understood where that sense of familiarity came from.

It was clearly... the Brahma Monarch Divine Power that Qianye Ying'er cultivated!

It was just that the realm was so high that he hadn't been able to connect it with his knowledge at first. Could this Myriad Dao Divine Officer actually be one of the sword attendant god races under the Heaven Punishing Divine Emperor... an Ancient Brahma God of the Brahma Monarch God Race!?

...

After leaving the Myriad Dao Divine Pavilion, Hua Caili was in high spirits. Amidst her cheerful laughter, she noticed Yun Che's brow was slightly furrowed and immediately asked, "Elder Brother Yun, you don't seem happy. Are you... thinking about the lost Yunli Sword again?"

Yun Che returned to his senses and shook his head. "I remember when you mentioned the Myriad Dao Divine Officer to me before, you said he was a very gentle old grandpa who was always smiling."

"That's right."

Hua Caili blinked. "Grandpa Wandao has always been like this. I've never seen him get angry, although... for some reason, the Abyssal Knights all seem to be very afraid of him."

Yun Che pondered for a moment. "In the future, it's best you come to this Myriad Dao Divine Pavilion less often."

"Huh?"

Hua Caili was surprised and confused. "Why?"

"Probably..."

Yun Che made up a casual excuse. "I just don't like this place?"

"Alright."

Hua Caili nodded in agreement. "Then I won't come here anymore. A place Elder Brother Yun doesn't like is a place I won't like either."

...

After a brief farewell to Hua Caili, Yun Che returned to his original __cpLocation to find Meng Kongchan already waiting for him.

He did not ask why the Spirit Immortal Divine Officer had summoned him, only smiling faintly. "You're back just in time. I have already bid farewell to the Grand Divine Officer. It is time to leave the Pure Land and return to prepare for stepping into the Eternal Pure Land."

"But before we leave, there's a big show to watch."

"A big show?"

Yun Che raised an eyebrow slightly.

Meng Jianxi gave a mysterious smile. "You'll know when the time comes."

Just then, Yun Che's brow furrowed slightly, and he said in a very low voice, "Senior, at this very moment, is anyone spying on this place?"

Meng Kongchan's gaze shifted to Yun Che, staring at him for a moment before he slowly said, "No. Where the Divine Sovereign resides, even in the Pure Land, no one would be so discourteous as to pry. Yuan'er³, why do you ask?"

Yun Che's brow relaxed a little. "Ever since I entered the God-Sleep Forbidden Domain, I've occasionally felt a spiritual sense spying on me in secret. It just appeared again. But if even Senior is completely unaware... then it's highly likely an illusion."

Meng Kongchan's eyes narrowed slightly. After a brief silence, he spoke slowly, "In this world, not even the Abyssal Emperor could approach with his spiritual sense without triggering my soul sense. Perhaps the soul-wound you sustained from the Punishment of Savage Desolation has not fully healed, which is why you occasionally have these strange feelings."

The meaning behind his words was that it wasn't "highly likely" an illusion, but that it must be an illusion.

"Brother Yuan," Meng Jianxi said with no small amount of concern, "a soul-wound is no small matter. It would be best to rest and recuperate for a while after you return this time. You must not push yourself."

"Mm, I understand." Yun Che nodded in agreement, the frown on his brow gradually smoothing out completely.

A faint sense of being watched... yet even the Divine Sovereign, the one with the strongest soul power in this world, was completely unaware...

The prying sensation he felt in the God-Sleep Forbidden Domain could be suspected to be a remnant ancient soul that hadn't been completely annihilated by the Abyssal Dust. But this was the Pure Land!

In that case... it really should be an illusion created by the lingering soul-wound from the Punishment of Savage Desolation.

At this thought, Yun Che closed his eyes and cleared his mind. In just a few breaths, he had forcibly expelled all extraneous thoughts.
