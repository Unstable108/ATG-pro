"God of Unseeing¹, is this the hospitality of your Eternal Night Divine Realm?" Meng Kongchan and Hua Fuchen, two great gods arriving together—what an earth-shattering scene—were blocked outside a chilling, oppressive barrier. Faced with such treatment, neither god showed the slightest surprise, nor did they attempt to shatter the barrier. Instead, they came to a halt, their expressions carrying an intriguing subtlety.

"Scram!"

A piercing, soul-rending voice so sharp it seemed about to pierce through eardrums: "Your filthy, vile male presence has already defiled this deity's senses! Get lost immediately!!"

"Hah!"

Meng Kongchan gave a cold laugh, addressing her directly by name: "Shen Wuyanye, do you not intend to give Meng a proper account?"

"Account?? Hahahahaha!"

Her laughter was shrill and chilling, sending shivers down the spine: "You, Dreamweaver², and Broken Heaven³ conspired together, launching a sneak attack in the Divine Slumber Forbidden Zone, targeting my Eternal Night Goddess, nearly causing her to fall gravely wounded! Considering our __cpLocation in the Pure Land, I have held back from taking action for now. What face do you have to come asking me for an 'account'!"

"Indeed, even after becoming gods, you can never wash away the filth and vileness in your very bones!"

Meng Kongchan, however, showed not a trace of anger, instead offering a faint smile: "Hehehe, the truth of the matter, we both know it well in our hearts."

Hua Fuchen also smiled as he spoke: "Brother Meng, just as I said. As gods of divine realms, yet to turn heaven and earth upside down right before each other's faces—truly worthy of the title 'God of Unseeing'."

He emphasized the words "Unseeing" heavily, his mild words laced with biting sarcasm in every syllable.

"Physical blindness can still allow one to perceive the world with the heart, but when the heart is so blind that it deceives both others and oneself, that is truly the height of sorrow, utterly beyond cure." Instantly, the temperature of the surrounding space plummeted sharply, chilling the nearby Eternal Night Maidens and Abyssal Knights to the bone. As the god most prone to anger, one who might even go mad at any moment without provocation, Shen Wuyanye's reaction was hardly surprising. The wrath of the God of Unseeing was enough to make the entire Eternal Night Divine Realm tremble, yet how could it intimidate these two great gods?

Hua Fuchen's brow furrowed slightly, his voice cooling several degrees: "Shen Wuyanye, you repeatedly question us 'what face do we have.' Yet the faces of Hua and Brother Meng are clearly exposed under the heavenly light of this Pure Land at this very moment, not concealed in the slightest, for all spirits of heaven and earth to gaze upon!!"

"And as for you, Shen Wuyanye... Hah!"

Hua Fuchen let out a faint, mocking laugh, and Meng Kongchan had already taken over his words: "The illustrious God of Unseeing, when paying respects to the Abyssal Emperor upon this Pure Land, must still travel by palanquin, body shrouded, face veiled by black curtains. What? Does the God of Unseeing know her own visage is so hideous that it repels both man and god, frightens even ghosts to despair, is rejected by all creation, thus forcing her to hide behind layer upon layer of coverings, not daring to show herself!?"

"You... seek... death!!" A terrifying, yin-charged wind surged forth, instantly darkening the heavenly light. The surrounding space seemed to plunge into a frozen hell. Such deliberate belittlement would not anger any other god, only elicit their derision—yet it struck directly at the core weakness of the God of Unseeing! The more one hides, the more one cares!

A howling cold wind, murderous intent filling the sky, causing the robes of the two gods, Dreamweaver and Broken Heaven, to snap and billow.

"Your Excellency, calm your wrath!!"

The urgent voice of Shen Wumingque rang out: "This is the Pure Land, you must not take action! If Your Excellency acts in anger, it would instead... play right into their hands!"

The chilling domain and murderous intent abruptly halted, but Hua Fuchen spoke lightly, pouring oil on the fire: "The God of Unseeing truly worries excessively. Those qualified to set foot upon the Pure Land are all of noble origins and possess exceptional cultivation. Even if startled and shaken to the soul by the God of Unseeing's hideousness, they would never speak of it, nor show it in expression."

"Meng... Kong... chan! Hua... Fu... chen!" Shen Wuyanye's voice trembled so violently it was almost incomprehensible. Upon reaching their ears, even the Abyssal Knights ten miles away felt their souls shuddering, nearly shattering.

"Remember well the words you speak today! One day... I will make you pay the price... I will make you regret every single word spoken this day!!" Such towering rage from Shen Wuyanye was something even her closest Eternal Night Maidens had never witnessed. They all trembled like sieves, faces pale as paper, several of them swaying unsteadily, bodies trembling like candles in the wind. The extent of her cruelty and terror within the Eternal Night Divine Realm was clear.

"Your Excellency, calm your anger... calm your anger!" Shen Wumingque pleaded again and again with a strained voice.

At this moment, she stepped out from behind the barrier, standing before Meng Kongchan and Hua Fuchen, offering a hurried bow: "Two great gods, the 'account' you seek has neither proof nor basis. Yet one thing is certain: the sword wound on our Eternal Night Goddess was indeed inflicted by Sky-Cleaving Sword Intent."

"This is upon the Pure Land, not..."

"You're right, there is neither proof nor basis."

Meng Kongchan cut her off, his faintly lowered silver gaze causing Shen Wumingque's spirit to instantly crumble, her entire body shuddering in terror: "Otherwise, would I merely be moving my lips?"

Enduring the gaze of the God of Dreamweaver from such close proximity, Shen Wumingque felt every strand of her soul string laid bare under his divine eyes. With but a single thought, an instant, he could easily snap them, like dried silk threads turned to dust by wind. The Divine Slumber Forbidden Zone lay outside anyone's gaze, so regarding the Eternal Night Goddess's attempt to kill Yun Che, there was only Yun Che's one-sided account, without any proof.

"God of Unseeing, please restrain your agitation."

Meng Kongchan narrowed his eyes slightly, glancing obliquely at the barrier behind, the corners of his eyes faintly overflowing with a dim silver glow: "Meng's visit is not to demand redress, but to return an item."

Swish! A soft sound as a silver folding fan unfolded in Meng Kongchan's hand. The fan's surface was adorned with freely flowing, wildly unrestrained calligraphy, imbued with a faint divine aura that even long years had failed to completely erase. The signature at the end of the fan ribs, executed with exceptional flair, was none other than... Shen Wuxueyan!

Although Shen Wuyongye could not see, her other four senses far surpassed ordinary people. In the first instant, she detected that aura she could never forget... an aura that even now, in the eternal darkness, tormented her.

"That is... that person's belonging!" Her rage, her killing intent suddenly crumbled into chaos. The chilling oppression in the space instantly transformed into uncontrolled turbulence.

"Where did you obtain such a filthy object?! That beast's belongings should have been utterly erased from this world by me long ago!" Looking at the words on the fan, Shen Wumingque suddenly stared blankly, as if having lost her soul.

Meng Kongchan spoke indifferently: "Ten thousand years ago, on the eve of my ascension to godhood, Shen Wuxueyan came to 'bid farewell,' lamenting that henceforth there would be no more 'Brother Meng,' only the title of god. This fan, crafted from Soulfade Divine Jade, was the parting gift Shen Wuxueyan gave me then."

"On a sudden whim back then, I invited him to inscribe the fan. He asked what I wished him to write. I told him to simply inscribe what was most on his mind at that moment... hence the words upon this fan."

"Night Patrol Envoy⁴,"

Meng Kongchan's gaze once again turned toward Shen Wumingque: "Why don't you read aloud for your God of Unseeing what is written upon this fan."

Shen Wumingque's lips parted, but not a single word could emerge.

Suddenly, Shen Wuyanye's fierce voice exploded in her ears: "READ!!"

Shen Wumingque's entire body shuddered, nearly spitting blood. Her throat convulsed violently before she managed to rasp out the words on the fan with difficulty: "Xi breeze⁵ caresses the jade shadow... Splendid moon reflects the inch-deep heart."

The chaotic cold, oppression, and killing intent abruptly froze. The entire world suddenly fell into an eerie silence. Xi breeze... Splendid moon... Xi Hua... Shen Wuxihua! In everyone's ears, a faint wailing sound suddenly arose—the disordered true god aura stirring the trembling of space.

"Hah... hah... hahahahaha!"

Shen Wuyanye burst into a fit of mad laughter, each sound hoarse, each sound piercingly mournful: "Shen Wuxueyan! Several thousand years... it has been several thousand years! That the falsehood and filth you left behind still lingers in this world, once again defiling my ears... You deserve a thousand cuts! You deserve to die without a burial place!"

This folding fan and the words upon it were also seen by Hua Fuchen for the first time. He slightly lowered his brows, his emotions momentarily somewhat complex. 'Xi breeze caresses the jade shadow, splendid moon reflects the inch-deep heart'... every word brimming with sentiment, every word filled with longing.

The name "Xi Hua" seemed etched upon the heart. Shen Wuxueyan, Shen Wuxihua... The truth of that time, was it truly as the rumors say? And ultimately... who betrayed whose true heart?

"Damned... Damned! Damned!! Die!!!" Each fierce cry was like that of a despairing she-wolf, a heartless evil spirit, sending chills down the spine.

Meng Kongchan discarded the folding fan on the ground: "From this day forth, my Dreamweaver and Eternal Night share only grievance, no grace. This object naturally should be returned."

He gave a cold stare toward the violently trembling black palanquin behind the barrier, then turned and walked away side by side with Hua Fuchen. Even after they had gone far, Shen Wuyanye's shrieks still lingered in the air.

"How was it?"

Hua Fuchen asked.

"Hmph!"

Meng Kongchan gave a cold snort: "Even easier than I anticipated. After all, she is, at her core, a madwoman. The flaws in her soul are so great... there were even moments when I felt it beneath me to act."

"But..."

His eyes suddenly turned cold, his soul power imposing: "Whoever dares to touch my Yuan'er⁶, regardless of who they are, must pay a price they will regret for a lifetime!"

Hua Fuchen suddenly said: "Back then, after Shen Wuxueyan's incident, you let out a long sigh of grief, and ever since have avoided speaking of matters related to him. Your friendship with Shen Wuxueyan was not shallow. I imagine the events of that year were not entirely as the rumors say?"

Meng Kongchan, however, shook his head: "Favors and grievances, rights and wrongs—when they fall upon oneself, they become a tangled mess. How can the karma of others be easily clarified? All I can say... based on what I know, saw, and felt... Shen Wuxueyan was not without feelings toward Shen Wuxihua back then. In fact, quite the opposite..."

He paused briefly, then continued: "However, being a divine prince, and with an excessive pride of manhood etched into his very bones, facing Shen Wuxihua who surpassed him in every aspect, his deeply ingrained nature caused his words and actions to be severely inconsistent. He even frequently made foolish moves for the sake of so-called divine prince dignity. The bitter fruit he ultimately reaped... could it not be said he brought it upon himself?"

Hua Fuchen nodded slightly and inquired no further.

————"Brother Yun, we're here!" Passing through group after group of Pure Land Divine Guards stationed here, what appeared before their eyes was a rather vast, even magnificent hall. The Hall of Myriad Paths! At the entrance stood a tall man, proud and upright. He had dark blue-green long hair, a face as cold and stern as ice sculpture, eyes hiding a chill. On his back rested a seven-foot sword sheath. Though the blade remained unseen, it released a piercing, bone-chilling cold that made all spirits retreat.

"Uncle Changying!" Hua Caili's call also confirmed his identity for Yun Che. One of the Four Divine Attendants of the Pure Land, the personal attendant of the Myriad Paths Divine Official—Changying!

His indifferent, expressionless gaze swept briefly over Yun Che and Hua Caili. Divine Attendant Changying gave a slight nod: "The master has given instructions. Enter."

Hua Caili took Yun Che's hand and led him directly into the hall, whispering at the same time: "Uncle Changying dislikes talking the most, but he's not harsh either. Just ignore him."

Having been summoned by the Abyssal Emperor, receiving pleas from the two great Divine Officials, Liu Xiao and Ling Xian, the name "Yun Che" now rang like thunder upon the Pure Land. Yet when Yun Che and Hua Caili passed by Changying's side, his gaze never wavered, nor did his aura linger upon Yun Che. Such indifference suggested an inner nature of one who rigidly adhered to rules... Yun Che memorized his appearance, aura, and his assessment of him.

"Grandfather Myriad Paths, we're here!" With Hua Caili's crisp call, Yun Che's footsteps also landed within the hall... In that instant, it was as if the world had changed, heaven and earth reversed. A dense aura, as if spanning endless eons, surged toward him like a tide, instantly enveloping his entire being. The sheer richness and intensity of this aura caused Yun Che's perception to go blank for several moments. That extreme antiquity, solemnity, vastness, and profound gravity... as if billions of stars silently revolved deep within the hall, seeming to emanate from the long-departed era of the gods.

The Hall of Myriad Paths, the treasure repository carrying the three million years of history and底蕴 (底蕴 -底蕴,底蕴) of the Pure Land. From the very first moment Yun Che arrived, his original expectations were completely overturned. The divine aura filling this place was in no way comparable to the mere thickness of a single divine realm's power. It seemed to carry the boundless vastness of the entire Abyssal history. Every wisp of aura spoke of the supreme底蕴 (底蕴 -底蕴,底蕴) of the Pure Land.

[Earlier text from ancient times mentioned the concluding flame of the Phoenix Requiem, which was initially named "Thousand Feathers Extinguish the Nether Tune." However, as it was from too long ago and the Phoenix Flame wouldn't appear in the early stages, it was completely forgotten -_-||]

[Thus, we can only forcibly activate the Nirvana Demonic Time Wheel Pearl, using the dark, sinful hand of causality to change the earlier text's "Thousand Feathers Extinguish the Nether Tune" to the current "Ashes of Calamity, Mercy-Born Tune." Everyone, please act as if nothing happened ε=(´ο｀*)))]
