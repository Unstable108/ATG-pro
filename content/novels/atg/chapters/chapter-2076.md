The five words sounded like the low groan of a devil.

It also sounded like a distant sound that came from beyond the heavens, or the low, silent hum of a bottomless abyss.

When the voice descended, the sinister, devilish figure in Yun Che’s eyes slowly disappeared… and reappeared in the Dreamless Divine Regent’s eyes instead.

“Nirvana… Devil… Emperor… Soul…”

Li Suo whispered in a daze as Yun Che’s soul sea slowly cleared up.

She recalled the moment where Chi Wuyao, the one they called the Devil Queen, injected a whopping eighty percent of her Nirvana Devil Emperor Soul into Yun Che’s soul before he jumped into the Abyss of Nothingness.

Yun Che did not possess the ability to pilot the Nirvana Devil Emperor Soul. He could not even activate of his own accord.

“However, it was cut away and transferred to you by my own will, so it will not give you any trouble whatsoever… until you trigger it.”

“What will happen… when I trigger it?” “It will be like a Devil God who is startled awake from its slumber.”

“It may be the Nirvana Devil Emperor’s… final show of rage in this world.”

As Chi Wuyao’s old words flashed through her mind, Li Suo finally understood what Yun Che was plotting.

The Heart Painter Divine Regent, who was rumored to love his daughter like his own life, the engagement between the Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter and Boundless Divine Son, the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God where its profound practitioners mainly cultivated soul energy and possessed the ability called “Falling Dream”, the three Divine Regents who were best friends…

Considering all the above factors, his reunion with Hua Caili in the Endless Fog, and his soul searching for Meng Jianzhou… It was only now that Li Suo realized that Yun Che had been plotting this exact moment since that day.

When she saw the pitch black devilish silhouette appearing in Meng Kongchan’s eyes, she knew that Yun Che had succeeded!

Although a few wisps of Nirvana Devil Emperor Soul were practically nothing compared to a complete True God’s soul, it was still the soul of a Devil Emperor. Even in the ancient Era of the Gods, a Devil Emperor’s soul was the highest soul in the universe and an entire great plane greater than a True God’s soul.

Moreover, this wasn’t a head-on fight between two souls. This was the Dreamless Divine Regent in full control until the point where he suddenly bore the full brunt of a Devil Emperor’s furious rebound. To say that he wasn’t expecting it would be an understatement.

A silver needle could never destroy a piece of rotten wood spanning over hundreds of thousands of kilometers, but it could certainly leave a permanent mark on the rotten wood!

The rage of a Devil Emperor could shake the soul of all devils.

Meng Kongchan’s facial features began shaking. The devilish silhouette in his eyes warped at a rapid rate before fading into nothing bit by bit. Its furious cry was growing increasingly distant as well.

When the devilish silhouette completely disappeared, so did this wisp of Nirvana Devil Emperor Soul. With this, the wisp in Chi Wuyao’s body was truly the final soul wisp of the Nirvana Devil Emperor in the entire universe.

In exchange, Yun Che was able to leave an eternal imprint of darkness in the Dreamless Divine Regent’s soul.

After the devilish silhouette was gone, the black light covering Meng Kongchan’s eyes gradually disappeared as well.

Right now, the man was staring fixedly at Yun Che with shaking eyes, trembling lips, and chaotic aura. He looked nothing like the absolute, cold, dignified ruler he was before.

This level of loss of control should never have appeared on a Divine Regent.

“Yuan’er… you’re Yuan’er! You’re Yuan’er!! ”

He stammered, each word shaking like a leaf being ravaged by a storm.

“...” A glimmer of astonishment flashed in Yun Che’s eyes.

Meng Kongchan’s reaction was far, far greater than he initially anticipated.

Clearly, he had underestimated the weight of “Meng Jianyuan” in the Dreamless Divine Regent’s heart.

Yun Che chose this moment to look up, eyes overflowing with the befuddlement of someone who just awoke from a deep slumber, “What did you just say, Dreamless Divine Regent? What Yuan’er?”

Meng Kongchan leaped off his throne. It was a simple movement no profound practitioner should fumble with, much less the Dreamless Divine Regent himself. However, the man actually stumbled as he rose from his throne. He did not bother to adjust his balance, however. He staggered over to Yun Che before grabbing his arm with both hands, eyes glued to Yun Che’s face like his life depended on it:

“Yuan’er… you’re alive… you’re still alive!”

The Dreamless Divine Regent suddenly realized that he was crushing Yun Che’s arm and hurriedly withdrew his strength. Even so, he refused to let go. As soon as he finished, Yun Che saw a glint of wetness in the man’s trembling eyes.

Yun Che leaned away from the Dreamless Divine Regent a little while wearing a look of complete shock and uncertainty. “I am Yun Che, Dreamless Divine Regent. I am not this ‘Yuan’er’ you speak of. Please—”

“No, you are Yuan’er, the Yuan’er I have lost for over a century! ” Meng Kongchan’s agitation and tears were only growing with every word he spoke. “Back then, it was my failure that led to your disappearance. A hundred years… to think it has been a hundred years since you were gone… but I have never given up on finding you.”

“Thank the heavens that you’re still alive… thank the heavens that you’ve finally returned to my side… to think you’ve become a grown man… and are doing so well…”

His words were somewhat incoherent and growing raspier by the second. He was practically sobbing at the end.

Yun Che slowly shook his head. “I’m sorry… I really don’t know what you’re talking about, Dreamless Divine Regent…”

It was at this moment a hasty shout erupted from outside the palace, “What happened, Father?”

Meng Kongchan’s aura was out of control, and his voice even more so. Meng Jianxi was residing in the nearby divine palace, so he was alarmed as a matter of course. When he rushed into the building though, he skidded to a stop. He could hardly believe what he was seeing.

His body was shaking, and his eyes were filled with tears… this was the second time in his life that he saw his Father acting this way.

The first time was when Meng Jianyuan disappeared a hundred years ago.

The tall, sharp-eyed youngster who was following behind Meng Jianxi was wearing the same shocked expression as well.

Meng Kongchan turned to look at Meng Jianxi, the agitation in his voice not decreasing in the slightest despite their presences. “Jianxi, Jianze! Yuan’er came home… he finally came home! This is Yuan’er!”

“...?!” Meng Jianxi looked at Yun Che with unbridled shock.

Meng Jianze’s eyes widened like saucers as well. He stared at Yun Che and asked disbelievingly, “Which… which Yuan’er?”

Meng Jianxi chose this moment to step forward and exclaim in an excited voice, “Is he… Brother Yuan?”

“That’s right! That’s right!”

It was only now that Meng Kongchan finally managed to recollect himself a little. He sucked in a deep breath and reined in his aura and emotions as best he could. “Yuan’er didn’t die. In fact, he came back safe and sound.”

“Meng Jianxi: “...”

“This is…” Meng Jianze looked back and forth between Yun Che and Meng Jianxi. He had no idea how he should react right now.

Yun Che turned away and replied evenly, “Greetings, Dreamweaver Divine Son. This one is Che of Yun. As per the Heart Painter Divine Regent’s order, I have come to visit the Dreamless Divine Regent. I am no ‘Yuan’er’. The Dreamless Divine Regent must be mistaken.”

“It's no mistake!”

Meng Kongchan never let go of Yun Che. It was as if he was afraid that his beloved son would disappear from the world as soon as he relinquished his grip. “Tell me, Yuan’er. How old are you? Are you a hundred and twenty years old[1] right now?”

“I am.” Yun Che nodded.

Meng Kongchan continued, “The Heart Painter Divine Regent told me that you were rescued when you were around ten years old. After you awakened, you completely lost your memories from before you were ten. Is that true?”

“That is true.” Yun Che nodded again. 𝙛𝒓𝒆𝙚𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝓸𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝓶

Meng Kongchan’s grip tightened slightly as he stared into Yun Che’s eyes. “My Yuan’er went missing about a hundred years ago. He vanished without a trace when he was ten.”

“The time and age all match.”

He continued, “You must have lost your memories because you suffered soul damage from whoever ambushed you back then. Meng Jianyuan was your name before you were ten… the name I gave you personally.”

Yun Che paused for a moment, but he still shook his head. “The time and age could just be a coincidence. You can’t possibly decide that I am Meng Jianyuan just based on that.”

Meng Kongchan’s eyes grew even wetter. They had never left Yun Che besides the moment Meng Jianxi and Meng Jianze had rushed into the divine palace. “I am Meng Kongchan, Divine Regent of the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God! My soul may crumble, and my cognition may suffer irreparable damage, and I still wouldn’t fail to recognize my own son!”

“Your soul, your aura, your flesh and blood… How could I mistake you for someone else? How could I mistake you for anyone else?!”

“This is…”

Meng Jianze turned to look at Meng Jianxi and found his eyes to be red with tears. Meng Jianxi exclaimed with clear agitation, “I can’t believe it… it's practically a miracle! What a wonderful day this is turning out to be!”

As he spoke, he strode up to Yun Che and put a hand on Yun Che’s shoulder. “Welcome home, Brother Yuan. Do you have any idea how much Father has missed you? He thinks of you day and night, and he has never extracted himself from the quagmire of guilt and regret. He never stopped searching for you even though a hundred years have passed.”

“Your safe return isn’t just an occasion worth celebrating by the entire Dreamweaver Kingdom of God. You have saved Father as well!”

The excitement and sentimentality in his eyes were no less great than Meng Kongchan’s.

“Hahahaha!” Meng Kongchan laughed heartily. “That’s right. There is nothing more deserving of celebration than this. I must announce to the entire realm… no, the entire Abyss that my Yuan’er has returned!”

Contrary to their unbridled excitement, Yun Che looked even more puzzled and lost than before. He stressed, “Dreamless Divine Regent, Dreamweaver Divine Son, I don’t want to let you down, but as I’ve already mentioned, this one is Che of Yun. It's the name I received from my master, and it's the one I will carry for the rest of my life. I will never give it up no matter what.”

“Today is the first time I have set foot in the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God, and as far as I am aware, I don’t remember this place at all, much less the name Meng Jianyuan. Please see the truth and understand that I am Yun Che, not Meng Jianyuan!”

“How dare you!”

Before Meng Kongchan could answer, a sharp rebuke came from a stern-faced Meng Jianze, “Who do you think Father is? There is no way he could mistake his own son! Today is the first day you return after a whole century, and you dare question and contradict him already?! You—”

The sound of Meng Jianze’s teeth and cheek bones cracking resounded throughout the hall. Sticky red blood sprayed out of his mouth as he was flung toward the wall on the far end.

What an idiot… Meng Jianxi thought to himself.

When Meng Jianze climbed back to his feet in a hurry, the first thing he saw was his Father’s eyes. Those violent, dark, murderous eyes that looked like they wanted to rip him apart limb from limb.

Such were Meng Kongchan’s eyes that his knees turned limp before he could stand, and infinite fear threatened to split his own eyes in half.

“Yuan’er has just returned from his tribulation, and I don’t even know how to compensate him for all the things he must have suffered for the past hundred years… and you dare to rebuke my Yuan’er?!”

The rage of a Divine Regent was like the collapse of heaven itself. Meng Jianze was one of Meng Kongchan’s most outstanding sons. That was also why he had never seen such a look from his Father. Terrified, he immediately prostrated himself and stammered, “This… This child would not dare. This child was just—” “Get out!”

“Yes… yes!”

Meng Jianze crawled out of the hall in reverse before fleeing in panic.

When Meng Kongchan’s gaze returned to Yun Che, the storm of violence immediately melted to gentleness once more. “That’s fine. Your master saved your life. He isn’t just your benefactor, but my and the entire Dreamweaver Kingdom of God’s benefactor. Since you’ve lost your memories, it is only natural that you wouldn’t be able to accept your old identity or this old man. It must feel like all this has sprung up out of nowhere, right? Yes… it’s only natural.”

“So, if you really call yourself Yun Che, then go ahead. If one day you recall your old name, or if you are willing to accept this Father, then you can consider picking up your old name again… alright?”

This wasn’t just a compromise. It was almost as if he was currying favor with Yun Che.

“Er…” Meng Jianxi advised, “Father, I know that you harbor great regrets for brother Yuan, and you only wish you can give him the world to make up for everything that happened to him. However, Brother Yuan is your son. For a Divine Regent’s son to go by a different surname… that’s going to generate some criticism.”

“Haha.” Meng Kongchan’s only response was an uncaring chuckle. “Yuan’er came back to me safe and sound. This is already a miracle I dare not dream of, so how can I possibly ask for more? As long as Yuan’er is safe, then I am more than glad to fulfill his desires.”

Yun Che did his best to suppress the confusion on his face and said respectfully, “Words cannot describe how overwhelmed I am to receive such favor from you, Dreamless Divine Regent. It’s just… I really am too overwhelmed right now. I truly do not know how to act or respond right now.”

From the start until now, Yun Che was clearly unwilling to address Meng Kongchan as Father or accept his “true” identity. Meng Kongchan was disappointed as a matter of course, but he did not hesitate to console Yun Che. “It’s fine, its fine! I’m the one who’s being too hasty here. Please don’t let my attitude pressure you, okay? I promise that I will find a way to restore your memories. Until then, you may be whoever you want to be. I promise that I won’t pressure you one bit.”

Yun Che bowed deeply. “Thank you, Dreamless Divine—”

“Cut it out. You and I are father and son. Such pleasantries are unnecessary, no?” Meng Kongchan stopped Yun Che’s salute while looking him up and down. The more he saw, the happier he became. “Heavens, you are so much more handsome than I was as an adult. Your mother would be overjoyed if she could see you right now.”

“Now I understand why that girl—”

Meng Kongchan suddenly cut himself off and looked at Meng Jianxi. “Jianxi, announce to the entire realm that Yuan’er has safely returned to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God! I want five thousand first-class abyssal crystals to be added to each Great Dream Hall, the Dream Prayer Immortal Region to be open to all disciples above Divine Sovereign Realm for three months, the sentences of all criminals in the Sin Region to be reduced by a hundred years, and all offering to be lifted from all vassal regions for a hundred years… do it quickly!”

Meng Jianxi forced down his shock and respectfully left to carry out his orders.

Meng Kongchan then pulled Yun Che and said, “Come, Yuan’er. We are leaving… for a place that belongs only to you.”

The second Meng Jianxi left the Dreamweaver Divine Palace, his expression abruptly darkened like a storm. However, it gradually subsided as he walked.

It wasn’t long before Meng Jianze rushed out from the corner and fell in behind Meng Jianxi. Right now, his silver robe was covered in blood, and one side of his face was completely swollen. He looked terrible. Even now, there was lingering shock and fear on his face.

“Your Highness, is that boy… really Meng Jianyuan? The one who should’ve died long ago?”

Every time Meng Jianze said a word, his broken teeth would hurt him to the core.

“Do you think Father would make a mistake on something like this?” Meng Jianxi replied indifferently. “It’s been a hundred years. Anyone would think that his killer had wiped him out without a trace. To think that he’s still alive… he is quite the fortunate man.”

Meng Jianze watched Meng Jianxi’s expression for a moment before asking carefully, “Your Highness, aren’t you… worried?”

“Worried? What for?” Meng Jianxi retorted.

“He is the previous Divine Son!” Meng Jianze said darkly, “It’s one thing if he is dead, but he is alive. That means he is a potential threat to your status!”

“Threat?” Meng Jianxi chuckled. “In terms of cultivation, he does not possess the resources of a Kingdom of God. He did become a level three Divine Master in a hundred and twenty years, and in most parts of the world, he would be a bonafide genius. But compared to me? He is nothing at all. As for familiarity and control over the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God, merits, and the loyalty of his subjects, we aren’t even in the same league.”

“Even if we ignore all this and look at divine essence only, I am still a tad stronger than him. What on earth makes you think that he could pose a threat to me in any way?”

“You are completely right, Your Highness, but I can’t help but worry after Father’s earlier… outburst.” Meng Jianze beseeched, “He only ever called us Jianxi or Jianze, but Meng Jianyuan? He only called him ‘Yuan’er.”

“There is one thing you must never forget, Your Highness. It is true that divine essence is a critical factor in choosing a Divine Son, but the one and only person who gets to make the final decision… is Father!”

Meng Jianxi’s footsteps slowed for just an instant.

“I’m sure you haven’t forgotten how Father reacted after Meng Jianyuan disappeared. Meng Jianyuan was just a baby who hadn't weaned off his mother’s milk, and Father had already made him the Divine Son. During the conferral ceremony, he only wished he could invite everyone under the heavens to attend and congratulate his son. He also started constructing Meng Jianyuan’s divine palace from the beginning. Even after he went missing, he continued the construction until it was complete.”

“In comparison, you still don’t have a divine palace of your own—”

“Enough.” Meng Jianxi cut him off coldly. “Jianyuan and I are brothers. We should work together toward bettering the kingdom, not be at odds with each other. You will refrain from speaking such things from now on.”

“Your Highness!” But Meng Jianze ignored his order and stressed, “My life and fate are bound to you, Your Highness. I would never, ever betray you. That is why you need to take me seriously!”

“Have you already forgotten what happened to the former divine son of the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God, Pan Buwang?”

Meng Jianze had chosen him as his lord a long time ago. When Meng Jianxi became the Divine Regent, he too would rise in power. Therefore, Meng Jianze was absolutely correct to say that his life and fate were bound to Meng Jianxi.

It was also why he was worried by Meng Jianyuan’s return and Meng Kongchan’s obvious bias toward him.

He wasn’t the only one who was worried after news of Meng Jianyuan’s return spread throughout the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God.

1. Just to clarify, but it’s really “second sixty-year cycle”, and it’s not an exact number. It’s why you guys were like, “Wait I thought YC is over forty so why is the tl saying he’s thirty?”. I try to be precise but you must know that memory doesn’t last forever and Mars’ update schedule hardly makes it easy for me to remember even how I used to tl this, much less precise numbers. ?
