“That demonic grandma probably ordered this pitiful girl to make an example out of you.”

Dian Rahu said indifferently, “Go. There is no need to show any mercy to a girl serving that old, demonic grandma.”

No one thought he was wrong to address Shenwu Yi as a “pitiful girl”. In another Kingdom of God, being chosen to be a Godbearer was the honor of a lifetime. But a Godbearer who Shenwu Yanye chose... how else could they describe her besides pitiful?

The previous Eternal Night Divine Daughter, Shenwu Qing, had carried herself with a kind of soul-piercing loneliness and gloominess. Perhaps the only warmth she ever felt came from the once arrogant and fearless, the “one who faced hardships head on,” Pan Buwang.

Today, her corpse was still cooling... actually, scratch that. Considering that Shenwu Qing committed what Shenwu Yanye considered the “gravest error” a woman could ever make, and refused to admit her mistake until the moment she died, it was entirely up for question whether she even left a corpse behind.

Dian Jiuzhi leaped into the air and landed inside the barrier as light as a feather and as elegant as a poem.

Although Dian Rahu told him not to show mercy to a daughter of Eternal Night, the self-cultivation that was etched in his very bones still caused him to give Shenwu Yi a polite salute. “Boundless Dian Jiuzhi greets you. I am honored to receive the guidance of the newly appointed Eternal Night Divine Daughter.”

Shenwu Yi did not say anything. She only turned her wrist and caused a soft ding to echo in everyone’s ears. There was a dark, crimson-colored flash, and a thin, long sword appeared in Shenwu Yi’s hand.

The hilt of the sword was pitch black in color. The blade was about 1.3 meters long and pitch black. It was etched with dark red patterns that glowed faintly like bloody pupils that were peering into the world from the darkest night.

Meng Jianxi explained to Yun Che softly, “This sword was originally the sword of the Divine Son of the Eternal Night Kingdom of God, ‘Crimson Pupil’.[1] However, Shenwu Yanye gave it an intolerably vulgar name after she became Divine Regent.”

“She named it the Heartless Sword.”

Yun Che: “...”

Yun Che wore a look of dumbfoundedness that Meng Jianxi clearly approved of. He continued, “The Eternal Night Kingdom of God has another Divine Son weapon called ‘Profound Sky Cleansing Moon’. It is a beautiful skybreak sting with spatial powers. Shenwu Yanye later changed its name to ‘Heartbreak Sting.’”

He shook his head with a regretful look on his face.

The Chief Priest raised his palm, and old, bronze-colored, profound light shone out of it. “Shenwu Yi of Eternal Night is at the sixth level of the Divine Extinction Realm. Dian Jiuzhi of Boundless is at the eighth level of the Divine Extinction Realm. For this battle, Dian Jiuzhi must accept the Profound Rage Seal so that his cultivation level is equal to Shenwu Yi’s.”

“I’m in your care, Chief Priest.” Dian Jiuzhi turned around to salute him.

However, a cold, indifferent voice rang beside his ears. “It is unnecessary.”

Dian Jiuzhi side-eyed Shenwu Yi with a slightly odd expression. After the initial shock had passed, the crowd was chuckling lightly or shaking their heads in silence. Dian Rahu, one of the few men who did not give a shit about the right place and time, was laughing out loud.

“Hahahaha! This girl... how interesting! Hahahaha!”

“Hmm? This woman... Just what is she thinking?”

Meng Jianxi frowned deeply. “Is she thinking about fighting Dian Jiuzhi at his strongest? Does she know who she is facing?? Has she gone mad?”

“...?” Yun Che was frowning slightly as well. It did not disappear even after a long time.

Dian Jiuzhi’s astonishment only lasted a moment. He did not jeer at her or get frustrated with her. Instead, he said calmly, “You are a permanent resident of the Eternal Night Kingdom of God, and today is our first meeting. I understand why you would not know much about me, Eternal Night Divine Daughter.”

“I am Dian Jiuzhi. I am currently fifty-two sexagenary years old and an eighth-level Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner. In terms of the profound way, I am fifty-one sexagenary years more experienced and knowledgeable than you. In terms of physical body, I possess the Divine Vein of Great Rage. It is fairly compatible with the Boundless Manifestation Art of the Boundless Kingdom of God.”

“In other words, even if my cultivation level is suppressed to your level, I still hold a great advantage in terms of the profound way and the physical body... Or more accurately, an unfair advantage.”

He did not conceal anything. He told Shenwu Yi exactly how big his advantage was.

“So I advise you to reconsider your words, Eternal Night Divine Daughter.”

However, Dian Jiuzhi’s kind words did not move Shenwu Yi’s expression in the slightest. When she spoke again, her tone was exactly as indifferent as before. “I said, it is unnecessary.”

The yellow light in the Chief Priest’s hand vanished, and he did not attempt to persuade Shenwu Yi. He said in a heavy voice, “In that case, the Profound Rage Seal will not be applied. Begin!”

There was no turning back once the Chief Priest had given his word... it would appear that even the Chief Priest disliked the Eternal Night Kingdom of God.

Dian Jiuzhi had more to say, but the Chief Priest’s verdict forced him to swallow it. Facing Shenwu Yi and hiding a sigh, he clasped his right hand behind his back and slowly raised his left hand.

“My age, cultivation level, and physical body are all greater than yours. Even if I win, it would not be a fair victory. Rather than winning, I would rather learn from you and witness the celestial appearance of the Eternal Night Divine Daughter with my own eyes. Only then will this fight be worthwhile[2].”

“So, I’ll allow you ten breaths to attack first. Ten breaths later, I will stop defending and start attacking.”

Ten breaths... At the level of the Divine Extinction Realm, being able to attack without retaliation for ten breaths straight was a significantly stupid handicap to say the least. If not for the fact that Dian Jiuzhi’s character was known to the entire Abyss, and that his expression and body language were completely honest... it would have been interpreted as a thorough insult.

“Hahahaha, good.”

Dian Ranhu let out another bark of laughter and said to the juniors standing next to him, “With this statement, Jiuzhi both showed off the generosity of Boundless without giving up any pretext for gossip, and humiliated the bitches of Eternal Night in the same sentence. This way, they can’t even make an excuse after they lose without looking ugly.”

Dian Sansi replied, “Actually, I think Jiuzhi is allowing the Eternal Night Divine Daughter the chance to show off the splendor of Eternal Night to everyone during these ten breaths. He hopes that this will allow her to wow the crowd and spread her name throughout the Abyss. Even if she ultimately loses, her journey to the Pure Land would not have been in vain[3].”

He added after a pause, “Jiuzhi has always been like this. He habitually hands out kindness to both familiar faces and strangers.”

Smile stiffening, Dian Rahu slowly shook his head. “Ah, dammit. He seriously is inflexible in this regard.”

Shenwu Yi did not say anything. One hand clasped behind her back, she slowly raised her sword and pointed it at Dian Jiuzhi, who was still unarmed at this point.

As the crimson markings on the blade grew dangerously deep, Yun Che snuck a glance at the cold, black, and oppressive-feeling palanquin.

From start to finish, Shenwu Yanye did not react at all.

The crowds were scoffing or snorting. Dian Rahu was openly laughing. The Lightless Divine Regent’s temper was legendary to put it mildly, and yet she remained unnaturally calm this whole time.

What was the Divine Vein of Great Rage? Yun Che knew it very well. Extraordinary physical strength and toughness weren’t the only qualities it bestowed. The quantity and quality of profound energy of a profound practitioner with the Divine Vein of Great Rage far surpassed that of a peer at the same level as well.

Even for her... Could she really defeat an eighth-level Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner at the sixth level, much less the possessor of the Divine Vein of Great Rage, Dian Jiuzhi?

The Chief Priest’s eyelids were lowered. He seemed to think that it was beneath him to watch this upcoming battle directly.

His understanding of the Divine Vein of Great Rage was far more profound than Yun Che’s. That was why he found it beyond laughable that the Eternal Night Divine Daughter was planning to challenge it without any handicap whatsoever.

It was at this moment that an ephemeral voice rang in his ears. “Rage, watch this girl closely.”

“...!” The Chief Priest’s gaze abruptly solidified.

Ding! Shenwu Yi moved, the Heartless Sword drawing a crimson line in the air and moving straight toward Dian Jiuzhi. However, the crimson line came to an abrupt stop an instant before it could reach the Divine Son. Dian Jiuzhi was currently holding two fingers in front of himself, and sitting between them was the shockingly cold tip of the Heartless Sword.

The blade stopped in mid-air, unable to move even an inch further. Shenwu Yi’s figure was frozen in place as well. Dian Jiuzhi’s expression did not change. His fingers weren’t covered in profound light. Not a single wound or a bead of blood could be seen either.

The youngsters who were witnessing Dian Jiuzhi’s strength for the first time were all crying out in astonishment. It was because Shenwu Yi’s sword was imbued with the terrifying, profound power of a sixth-level Divine Extinction Realm practitioner.

The light in Shenwu Yi’s eyes didn’t change. She abruptly spun on her feet and drew a crimson crescent next. The shrill noise of a blade cutting through the air was so sharp that it felt like the very space of Eden’s Crown was cut.

Ding!! There was a soft ding, and Dian Jiuzhi’s left hand appeared before his forehead. He had lifted a single finger and caught the tip of Shenwu Yi’s sword with it. That was the only move he made, but it was enough to wipe out the crimson scar in an instant.

Shenwu Yi’s form changed again. Like a stunning shadow, she spun in retreat before the Heartless Sword shone crimson and unleashed dozens of sword scars in an instant. Every single one of them contained the terrible power of a sixth-level Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner. Some of the scars looked like crescents, and some like bloody shadows. They wove a web that surrounded Dian Jiuzhi, causing the surrounding space to groan.

The web of slashes caused even the spectators to feel chilled to their core, but Dian Jiuzhi remained where he was. He did not move a muscle, and his expression did not change one whit. His right hand still clasped behind his back, he moved his left hand so fast that it left behind afterimages, and his fingers so swift that they looked like illusions. Showing exactly zero signs of panic or inelegance, he danced through the web of swords like a graceful butterfly.

Ding, ding, ding, ding...

A series of metallic clangs occurred as Dian Jiuzhi blocked the blade with his fingers. It sounded like metal rain. Each sound accurately matched a sword shadow, and each crimson scar was wiped away completely by his fingers. Forget leaving a wound on his person; the assault had failed to move even his sleeve. This was the case from the start until the end.

Gasps and cries of astonishment came from the crowd.

Meng Jianxi drew in a long, deep breath before exclaiming in surprise, “Earlier, I thought for sure that Shenwu Yi’s sixth-level Divine Extinction Realm was just a pretty shell with a rotten core that the Lightless Divine Regent had forced into existence by her terrifying obsession, but I was wrong. Her cultivation is as genuine as it gets!”

“Even through the barrier, I feel like those sword shadows could skewer me.”

“In comparison... it would appear that Dian Jiuzhi’s terrifying strength needs to be reevaluated yet again.”

Concealing his shock, Meng Jianxi lowered his voice and said, “It’s clear that his Divine Vein of Great Rage has ascended to greater heights not long ago... I can hardly believe that he’s handling the power of a sixth-level Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner like child’s play.”

Yun Che did not give him a response. Instead, he looked in the direction of the Eternal Night Kingdom of God once more. The stifling cold and quiet indifference that occupied that space hadn’t changed one bit.

Ding ding ding ding ding ding...

Again and again, Shenwu Yi attacked Dian Jiuzhi. Without exception, Dian Jiuzhi blocked it all with one hand.

It was, as Meng Jianxi said, child’s play. The gap was so large that the crowd gradually grew bored with the show.

Xian Yue withdrew his gaze and kept shooting glances behind his back.

“Don’t worry.”

Wushen Yue said, “Xing’er is removing a weight in his mind. He will return.”

Xian Yue regained his senses and fell into thought for a moment. Then, he blurted out, “Although Sha Xing and Pan Buwang were friends since long ago, why do I feel... like they share some sort of unknown story between them?”

The word “Fog Monarch” appeared in his head without warning, though he wiped it away just as quickly. Then, he turned around and asked, “Do you think Pan Buwang will be reappointed as the Owl Butterfly Divine Son after today, master?”

“Impossible.” Wushen Yue’s answer was the same as Meng Kongchan’s reply to Yun Che.

“But why?” Xian Yue couldn’t understand. He understood why the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God would have qualms, but impossible was such a strong word that there could be no doubt.

Wushen Yue said quietly, “When a person crosses a line that should never be crossed, it is only natural to fear the consequences that come of it. That same fear will drive them to do everything in their power to stop those consequences from becoming true.”

Wushen Xing looked at Xian Yue and explained, “Simply put, Pan Buzhuo acted too ruthlessly against Pan Buwang. He did not kill him, but he committed basically every vile act one possibly could to the man.”

“If it were just him, this could still be remedied. However, countless others have actively or passively become his accomplices in order to curry favor with Pan Buzhuo, the new Divine Son.”

“As if that wasn’t enough, the Pray Eternal Divine Regent ignored and indulged their actions. Sure, he never played an active role, but the pain he inflicted on Pan Buwang was possibly the worst out of all of them.”

“You’re aware of the final outcome. If Pan Buwang had not been kicked out of the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God, he would have succumbed to utter despair and committed soul suicide already.”

“So, knowing all that they have done to him, literally cornering him to the point where he was half a step away from self-destructing... who would dare to accept Pan Buwang’s return? Even if they compensated him as best they could, even if he acted perfectly friendly on the outside... who would dare to believe that his hatred had truly disappeared?”

“Let’s assume that he becomes the Divine Son once more, and the day comes where he inherits his divine power from Pan Yusheng... who could say he would not reveal his hidden hatred and enact bloody vengeance upon everyone who slighted him then? Heck, the first person he would kill could very well be Pan Yusheng.”

“... I see.”

Xian Yue seemed to get what they were saying.

“That said, although they could not make Pan Buwang the Divine Son once more, I am sure the Pray Eternal Divine Regent would spare no effort to bring him back to the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God. Not only that, he will do everything in his power to repair their relationship.”

Xian Yue thought for a moment before asking, “Is it because of the Abyssal Monarch... and because he is afraid that Pan Buwang would become a deadly, uncontrollable threat?”

“Those are two valid reasons.”

Wushen Xing narrowed his eyes slightly. “But personally, I believe that the most important reason is...”

Wushen Yue finished his sentence in a dark tone, “The ‘Original Abyss That Severs The Night’. That dark soul domain is good enough to be passed down in the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God for eternity. Not only that, Pan Buwang’s perfect body of darkness... Tsk. If they could somehow figure out its secrets, if they could find a way to replicate it... Pan Yusheng’s heart probably isn’t even here anymore. If not for the fact that the Abyssal Monarch is right here, I bet he would leave the Pure Land immediately and escort Pan Buwang back to the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God in person.”

Suddenly, an ear-vibrating screech of space erupted from the battlefield.

Shenwu Yi’s Heartless Sword was shaking violently. Its crimson light withdrew into itself until it formed a crimson sword projection so dense that it might as well be tangible. She turned slightly, and the thin, long sword bent dramatically like a bow. Then, it lashed out violently and unleashed a crimson blast in the sky, smoothly severing the world before everyone’s eyes from the very center.

It looked as if she had poured all of her power into the attack.

The light in Dian Jiuzhi’s eyes finally changed a little. He raised his left arm slightly, but he wasn’t just blocking with his fingers anymore. Instead, he spread his fingers wide and, amidst countless shocked gazes, grabbed the crimson sword projection with his bare hand.

CHICHICHICHICHICHI—

A terrible ripping sound exploded from the center of Dian Jiuzhi’s palm. Countless twisted, thin, and narrow red scars were erupting in the space as well. His face remained calm as he slowly clenched his fingers and rapidly extinguished it all, leaving behind only tiny fragments of light.

The sword projection wasn’t destroyed yet, but Shenwu Yi abruptly appeared beside Dian Jiuzhi. The light currently projected by the Heartless Sword was actually stronger than the sword projection she unleashed.

This time, Dian Jiuzhi moved. He leaned backward and moved the right hand he had been clasping behind his back this whole time. His movement seemed light and slow, but it accurately caught the blade at the same time a silver white light flashed out of his person.

There was a loud boom, and both the sword projection and the light of the Heartless Sword crumbled. Dian Jiuzhi flipped backward and landed on the floor as lightly as a falling leaf.

Before him, Shenwu Yi was propelled several kilometers in an instant. It wasn’t until she stabbed the sword into the floor and carved a three-hundred-meter-long scar that she finally arrested her momentum.

Ten breaths had passed, and Dian Jiuzhi hadn’t suffered a single wound. In everyone’s opinion, this was the end of this battle.

Dian Jiuzhi looked down at the slightly disheveled corner of his sleeve. He then paid Shenwu Yi a heartfelt compliment, “I’ll be honest, Eternal Night Divine Daughter. I had harbored doubt regarding your cultivation, thinking that it was the product of hasty accumulation and an unsteady foundation. I am deeply ashamed to have misjudged you this much.”

“One sexagenary year, the sixth level of the Divine Extinction Realm... I cannot hope to match even a sliver of your talent for the profound way. If we were the same age, I would not even have the right to face you in combat. Not even a little.”

Dian Rahu covered his face and sighed deeply. “I told him that there is no need to be courteous with a demoness of Eternal Night! Ai ai ai!”

Dian Sansi was looking at Dian Jiuzhi with respect and admiration, though. “This is how Brother Jiuzhi is. He would not change just because others push him to.”

Suddenly, his heart seized inside his chest, and he found himself casting Yun Che a sideways glance before he knew it. Brother Jiuzhi was such a good person, but to think... to think...

Dian Jiuzhi’s compliment to Shenwu Yi was heartfelt. He had also offered her more than enough face. Even if she were going to lose horribly, she would only lose a minimal amount of dignity now.

Shenwu Yi’s response was, “You talk too much.”

Dian Jiuzhi let out a small sigh before breaking into a relaxed smile. White light was circulating between his fingers when he raised his hand once more. An invisible, formless pressure was slowly spreading to the surroundings.

Ten breaths. That was the kindness he gave Shenwu Yi, knowing that there was no way he was going to lose. However, he had no idea that Shenwu Yi did not care about the ten breaths of “advantage” her opponent gave her at all.

1. Ed Note:I fought hard for "eye" here and above, but TL wouldn't budge! ☜

2. TL note:I gotta say, Dian Jiuzhi is insensitive to the max. He thinks he’s being courteous, but he’s really actively worsening Shenwu Yi’s situation. Assuming Shenwu Yi loses, Shenwu Yanye is going to rip her a few holes as compared to just one if he had just gone all out from the start. The guy really doesn’t use his head. ☜

3. TL note:I take it back, this whole goddamn kingdom is made of idiots. She would literally be tortured to death by Shenwu Yanye’s hand if the scenario you imagined happened, you stupid... ☜
