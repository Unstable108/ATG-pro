The Star and Moon Kingdom of God group had arrived in the Pure Land. Out of everyone in the group, Pan Buwang was the one person who appeared to be completely out of place. To say that his situation was awkward would be an understatement, especially since the younger Star and Moon disciples were all shooting him hostile glares.

As soon as they arrived in the Pure Land, Sha Xing grabbed Pan Buwang’s arm and stepped out in a timely fashion.

“You’re once again in the Pure Land, Brother Buwang. How do you feel?”

Pan Buwang said while staring forward, “Everything in the Pure Land feels like it would never change. As I look around, I am surprised to discover that the most unfamiliar thing in this world... is myself.”

“Oh?” Sha Xing was a bit surprised by his lamentation.

Pan Buwang smiled. “It’s just a bit of pathetic whining is all. You don’t need to pay it any heed, Star Divine Son, I’m sure you’ve encountered quite a bit of resistance to get me where I am today. I, Pan Buwang, will forever—”

“Hold it!”

Sha Xing cut him off before he could finish. “I’m just repaying a favor, so you can save it. Also, if you really are grateful, then why don’t you reveal some of your... relationship with ‘him.’”

Pan Buwang replied with a straight face, “Officially, there is no relationship. Privately, it is the same as yours, the relationship between a benefactor and a receiver.”

Sha Xing curled his lips. “Forget what I asked.”

He gave the former Owl Butterfly Divine Son a long side-eye and said, “You’ve changed a lot, Brother Buwang. You’ve changed so much I can barely tell you’re the same person. It makes me even more curious though. What on earth drove you to painstakingly attend this Pure Land Meet?”

He did not demand an answer despite saying this. He simply continued in a meaningful tone, “Whatever it is, I look forward to it.”

Suddenly, the air turned chilly, and even the light of the Pure Land dimmed a little. It was a natural sensation when dark energy was near. Sha Xing and Pan Buwang stopped in their tracks at the same time.

Up ahead was the Pray Eternal Divine Regent Pan Yusheng, and standing next to him was the Owl Butterfly Divine Son Pan Buzhuo. Led by three Pure Land Divine Guards, the duo were slowly walking toward them.

Pray Eternal Divine Regent’s spiritual perception was out of the world as a matter of course. Naturally, he had sensed Pan Buwang’s existence from the beginning. Despite this, he never so much as glanced at the man for even an instant. One would think that he had missed Pan Buwang completely.

Sha Xing swiftly greeted Pan Yusheng, “Sha Xing of the Star and Moon Kingdom of God greets the Pray Eternal Divine Regent and all other seniors.”

Pan Buwang also bowed a little and whispered, “Father.”

Pan Yusheng gave Sha Xing a nod but ignored Pan Buwang’s greeting completely. There was a small flash of astonishment in his eyes when Pan Buwang bowed to him, but it only lasted an instant. It was because Pan Buwang’s attitude toward him had become increasingly enraged, disappointed, screechy, and finally insane. Forget treating him with respect, Pan Buwang had strayed to the point that he dared to taunt him, the Divine Regent, to his face.

It was why this simple and obedient greeting—the word “Father”—felt so unfamiliar and almost like a blast from the past.

That was all though. He had given up on Pan Buwang a long time ago. He had even declared his utter abandonment of his son; that he would not care if he lived or died.

As the Owl Butterfly group were about to pass by Pan Buwang, Pan Buzhuo stopped in his tracks and looked Pan Buwang up and down curiously. He said, “Yo! Long time no see, stray dog who left our Owl Butterfly wailing at the top of his lungs. I heard you were going to drown yourself in the Sinking Moon Valley of Dreamweave but were chased out like a dog as well. Hah!”

“Who would’ve thought that the Owl Butterfly Divine Son would choose to become a cripple who knew nothing but intoxication and dreams? Thank goodness Dreamweaver had the sense to toss you out. Nobody cares if you embarrass yourself, but that action would have brought shame to the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God as well!”

Pan Buwang did not say a single word.

“Oh? It looks like you’ve gotten a little steadier.”

Pan Buzhuo seemed surprised by Pan Buwang’s lack of response, but he quickly followed up with a disdainful chuckle. “Have you changed after mucking around in the Endless Fog for a few years? I’m surprised to see you in the Pure Land. Are you planning to prove yourself in front of the Abyssal Monarch and convince Father to accept you once more?”

Pan Buzhuo cracked a rather vile grin and lowered his voice, “Quit dreaming already, you embarrassing piece of shit. Right now, you’re no different from a stray dog who’s halfway being rotted by abyssal dust. I can literally smell the pitiful stench of decay on you.”

Pan Buwang continued to keep his head lowered and stay silent. There was no discernible expression on his face either.

“Brother Buzhuo,” it was at this moment Sha Xing spoke up coldly, “a Divine Son should be above such pettiness.”

Pan Buzhuo withdrew his scornful smile and looked at Sha Xing. “Pan Buwang did nothing of note when he was a Divine Son, and he has repeatedly damaged Owl Butterfly’s reputation in recent years. I wasn’t expecting to meet him today, so I simply could not control my outburst. I apologize for making a fool out of myself in front of you, Star Divine Son.”

He smiled and finally began to leave. As he walked away though, he did not forget to leave one last scathing remark. “You are an honorable man, Star Divine Son. I would advise you to stay away from such filth. It could cause you bad luck.”

Walking at the forefront, Pan Yusheng never looked back or stopped Pan Buzhuo from making such remarks. Most of the people of the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God were shooting Pan Buwang indifferent or sympathetic looks as well.

After all, Pan Buwang was still the bright moon in the sky the last time they came to the Pure Land.

After the Owl Butterfly group was out of earshot, Sha Xing finally furrowed his brow and said a bit angrily, “Pan Buzhuo is seriously out of control!”

Pan Buwang replied expressionlessly, “His mother had my Mother killed not long after she ascended the throne, so there was no way he and I can ever stand on the same side. On top of that, the beatdown and humiliation I suffered overtly and covertly during the years he has been the Divine Son... I’m sure someone with your personality cannot even imagine them.”

“If not for my promise with Wuqing, I would have crumbled into pieces long ago.”

Sha Xing was unable to detect much hatred from Pan Buwang’s voice. Which was precisely why he was surprised, though he did not reveal his emotions on the outside.

Sha Xing gave Pan Buwang a clap on the shoulder and said seriously, “Just wait. I will put a lid on his flame when we are before the Abyssal Monarch. It’s not just to get one back for you, but also because that guy is just loathsome.”

Pan Buwang smiled back, the depths of his eyes a dark abyss Sha Xing could never reach. “I look forward to witnessing the power of your Heavenly Wolf once more.”

There was a buzzing noise from the distance, and the light screen of the Pure Land opened once more.

“It looks like the Eternal Night Kingdom of God has arrived as well.”

As soon as he said this, Sha Xing glanced at Pan Buwang out of the corner of his eye.

The hatred and killing intent he sensed for a few instants were so strong that he could not miss it even if he wanted to. Pan Buwang had faced Pan Buzhuo’s wanton insults without batting an eye, and yet the word “Eternal Night” alone was enough to cause his killing intent to spiral out of control.

Sha Xing gazed toward the distance and said expectantly, “We can finally witness the true countenance of the newly appointed Eternal Night Divine Daughter, Shenwu Yi. It best not be too disappointing considering how much effort they went through to hide her.”

Yun Che and Hua Caili had just entered the area when they heard a kaboom coming from the stone house in front of them. The next moment, clouds of black smoke began pouring out of the doors and windows of the house. It was unbelievably conspicuous considering that the Pure Land was mostly pure white.

“No! The heat control is all wrong! Annoying thing, get out get out get out!”

A young man walked out of the smoking stone house. As soon as he saw Hua Caili, he said smilingly, “You’re here, little Caili.”

As he spoke, he elegantly brushed off the soot on his sleeve.

“Uncle Yuan Ying.”

Hua Caili greeted him politely before launching an introduction, “This is big brother Yun, the previous Divine Son of the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God. His previous name is—”

“Oh! Meng Jianyuan, right? I’ve heard about him.”

Divine Attendant Yuan Ying said smilingly and innocently, “You’re a perfect God Bearer just like little Caili over here. The two of you are quite compatible in terms of talent... and even in terms of appearance. It’s too bad Jiuzhi got to Caili first, eh?”

Yun Che thought, "He has a pair of sharp eyes... and an even sharper tongue."

“Yun Che greets senior Yuan Ying. This is my first time coming to the Pure Land, but not the first time I've heard of your sterling reputation, senior Yuan Ying. I’ve wanted to meet you for a long time.”

“Ah, such secular words and customs! Save it, save it.”

Yuan Ying tried to wave Yun Che off when he realized that his smooth white hand was currently as black as the bottom of a pan. So, he slowly clasped the hand behind his back and said, “Master is currently in the middle of something. I would advise you not to disturb him during this time. Otherwise—”

Boom! As if on cue, another muffled boom came from the stone house, followed by even thicker columns of black smoke.

Right after that, an excited shout boomed from the stone house. “Oh ho! I did it! I did it! Come in quick, little Caili! I have some good stuff to share with you!”

Helplessness colored Yuan Ying’s face as he let out a long sigh.

“Big brother Yun, uncle Liu Xiao is calling for us. Let’s head inside!”

Hua Caili pushed off the ground and was inside the stone house in a flash.

Yun Che gave Divine Attendant Yuan Ying a polite nod before following suit.

Divine Attendant Yuan Ying did not try to stop them. He simply let out a quiet sigh. “That’s another poor youngster’s mind about to explode to smithereens.”

The stone house wasn’t big, but it was absolutely packed with all sorts of items.

Inside the rolling black smoke was a thin, short old man wearing a coarse and shabby gray outfit. Right now, he was crouching on the floor and rubbing his thin, dry hands around a crimson flame boasting unusual energy. His eyes were shiny, and his mouth was muttering something.

From Yun Che’s perspective, the old man looked like a toad with its forelimbs raised up into the air.

“Uncle Liu Xiao,” Hua Caili called out to the old man affectionately. The toad... oops, the old man in gray clothes immediately bounced to his feet and strode straight toward Hua Caili. “You came just in time, little Caili! Quick, taste it! This is a recipe I just finished improving! It took begging that old woman, Ling Xian, to lend me her flame periodically for far too long, but I finally finished it!”

“This is absolutely my greatest masterpiece in the past one thousand years! I promise that one bite is all you need to fly straight to the heavens!”

The old man had a haggard face and sunken eye sockets. However, his eyes were blazing with passion and vitality. Even the loose hair strewn across his head was all standing in excitement. His dirty old hands were palming an equally dirt-looking ball of something that was, despite its appearance, giving off a faint fragrance that stirred the soul.

“...” Yun Che was standing quietly behind Hua Caili, his lips twitching here and there despite his self-control. If he hadn’t heard Hua Caili addressing this poorly dressed, seemingly insane old man as “Uncle Liu Xiao”, he would never have believed that he was a High Priest!

Also, why did Caili address High Priest Ling Xian as “Grandma”, but this shriveled old man as “Uncle”?

“Wow! Really?” Hua Caili’s eyes curled into crescents. She did not hesitate to grab the shabby looking ball from the old man’s dirty hands and eat it.

Upon taking the first bite, Hua Caili’s eyes widened with pleasant surprise, “Mmh! It’s delicious! It’s the same Liu Xiao Immortal Climbing Flaky Biscuit as before, but a lot tastier... Mmh! Even the number of changes in taste have increased considerably.”

“Right? Right!? Huohahahahahahahaha!”

Hua Caili’s acknowledgement and praise nearly caused the old man to combust on the spot, and his crazed laughter was such that it looked like his soul was about to leave his body. “As expected of me!! As expected of the greatest Chef God of the Pure Land—oh no no no, of the entire Abyss!!”

“Oh right!! From now on, I’m going to change its name to ‘Liu Xiao Immortal Soaring Flaky Biscuit’! Anyone, be it true immortals or fake immortals, are going to fly once they eat it! Huohahahaha!”

Hua Caili was still chewing and tasting the Flaky Biscuit when she spoke up in the midst of the old man’s crazed laughter, “It is better than before, but it is just a little inferior compared to big brother Yun’s flaky biscuit.”

It was as if someone had cut off the old man’s mad laughter with a saber. The old man’s eyes were originally tiny, but now they were as big as bells.

“Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-You... What did you just say? Me? My Liu Xiao Immortal Flying Flaky Biscuit? Is just a bit inferior?!”

Even as he spoke, his eyes kept widening. It was as if her remark had unintentionally touched on the biggest taboo of his life.

Hua Caili nodded without any hesitation. Her eyes were as clear as mirror lakes, naive with a hint of innocence. Her words and her expression were so natural, so matter-of-fact, that at that moment, Yun Che swore that he heard the sound of something shattering inside the old man’s heart.

The old man then jumped to his feet and screamed, “Impossible!! It took me a thousand years and tens of thousands of times of adjustment to finally create this legendary Liu Xiao Immortal Flying Flaky Biscuit! I only wish I could give myself a kiss !”

“Who is that Yunonymous? How could an unlucky name like this possibly make a flaky biscuit that beats my masterpiece?!”

“His name isn’t Yunonymous.”

Hua Caili hurriedly corrected Liu Xiao. “And his flaky biscuit really is better than what you made, Uncle Liu Xiao. It’s not just flaky biscuits either. There are a lot of foods big brother Yun makes that are way better than yours.”

“...” Once again, Yun Che could hear the sound of something shattering into itsy bitsy pieces.
