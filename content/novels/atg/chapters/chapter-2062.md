“High Priest Wan Dao (Myriad Ways) is well-versed in everything ranging from the old to the new. There is nothing he doesn’t know. He is also in charge of the rare treasures of the Pure Land such as profound artifacts, Abyssal Crystals, formation cores, pills and more. He is the one who gave me my Glazed Cloud Sword.”

“High Priest Ling Xian (Spirit Fairy) is a very, very gentle old woman. If you meet her, I’m sure you won’t believe that she's a High Priest. Something is off though. I don’t know why, but she has given off a sorrowful feeling since I was a child. I once tried asking the other High Priests about it, but no one gave me an answer. Their expressions were odd as well.”

“High Priest Liu Xiao (Six Laughs) is a high priest who is even less like a priest than Grandma Ling Xian.”

“Ahem!” Hua Caili cleared her throat and tilted her head in an attempt to emulate a certain high priest’s lazy and unruly behavior.

“Laugh at others,

Laugh at yourself,

Laugh at the past and future.

Laugh at the heavens,

Laugh at the earth,

Laugh at the Buddha.”

After she was done, she stuck her tongue out in jest and complained, “That’s all he says everyday, and he never gets tired of it. Oh right!”

An idea clicked in her head as she looked Yun Che up and down eagerly. “If one day we go to the Pure Land, I must bring you to Uncle Liu Xiao. I’m sure he will adore you.”

“Why’s that?” Yun Che tidied his expression. “Should I act jovial all day and night as well?”

“Hehe. You’ll know when it is time.” Hua Caili smirked and did not give Yun Che an answer, though her delight suddenly jumped up a notch. If they could win the favor of a High Priest, then their relationship would face much less resistance.

“...” Yun Che looked thoughtful. “What about the Chief Priest? I haven’t heard much about him.”

“Chief Priest is the most mysterious and serious guy of them all.”

It was clear from Hua Caili’s description and tone that her relationship with the Chief Priest was the weakest of all the High Priests. “I rarely ran into him when I was at the Pure Land, and on the occasions where we did meet, he never interacted with me unless I interacted with him first... after that, I decided to ignore him.”

It was clear that Hua Caili was beloved in the Pure Land.

After all, the Four High Priests were existences that surpassed even the Six Kingdoms and Seven Gods, subordinate only to the Abyssal Monarch Himself.

“Does the Chief Priest not have a name or title of his own?” Yun Che asked.

“I don’t think so,” Hua Caili answered. “Even Grandma Ling Xian and the others address him as Chief Priest. But... there was one time the Chief Priest requested an audience while I was bidding Uncle Abyssal Monarch goodbye. I can’t be sure, but I think Uncle Abyssal Monarch called him, ‘Big Rage.’”

“...” Yun Che’s eyebrows twitched imperceptibly.

“High Priest Big Rage is such a weird name though. It doesn’t have the oomph of a Chief Priest at all.”

“Indeed.” Yun Che nodded with pretend seriousness. “Speaking of which, you mentioned that the Abyssal Monarch only created seven divine cores. In that case, how did the four High Priests inherit their power?”

“Huh? Inherit?” Hua Caili looked at him in surprise. “The four High Priests are similar to Uncle Abyssal Monarch in that they have existed since the beginning of the Abyss. They created the Abyss together with Uncle Abyssal Monarch and continued to exist to this day. You didn’t know, Big brother Yun?”

“The rumors are actually true?” Yun Che put on a suitable look of astonishment. “The Abyss has existed for over a million years, and I thought that no one besides the Abyssal Monarch could possibly live for so long. That is why I thought that the High Priests’ power was passed down the generations when you spoke about the ‘inheritance of divine origins.’”

Assuming that Hua Caili’s information was accurate, then the so-called Four High Priests were really...

Four ancient True Gods!

“According to the records, the abyssal dust was beyond terrifying when the Abyssal Monarch first descended upon this world. Even True Gods could not avoid dying to it. Since the Four High Priests managed to survive, they must be incredibly powerful right?” Yun Che asked yearningly.

Because Hua Qingying was near, Yun Che never probed Hua Caili regarding the Abyss of his own accord. It was always him asking about it after Hua Caili was led to divulge the information herself.

“Of course!” Hua Caili stood on her toes and moved closer to Yun Che, whispering, “I once asked Father if he could beat Grandma Ling Xian, and you know what Father said? He said forget him, not even the greatest Divine Regent of them all, Boundless End Divine Regent, could hope to defeat Grandma Ling Xian... I was really shocked when I heard this. After all, Grandma Ling Xian is such a gentle woman...”

Contrary to Hua Caili’s belief, Yun Che wasn’t surprised at all to hear this. Someone who became a True God via their own power and another who forcefully became a True God via inheriting divine origins are two completely different concepts, not to mention that the latter had to lose an entire chunk of their lifespan.

They walked slowly and unhurriedly, gradually getting closer to the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God.

The Abyss was massive, grayish white, and endless. However, it felt like the two of them were the only ones who existed in this world. This was doubly true for Hua Caili, whose infatuation with Yun Che only grew with every passing day. It was to the point where she often forgot that Hua Qingying existed at all.

“Once we pass through the region ahead of us, we’ll be entering the territories of our vassals.”

“They are either vassal states or vassal sects. Every year, they supply us with a sufficient amount of Abyssal Crystals of each type in exchange for our protection. Every ten years, someone is dispatched to rebuild the barrier that isolates the abyssal dust. Sometimes, we would recruit young and sufficiently talented profound practitioners into the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God as well... hmm?”

Hua Caili’s voice suddenly came to a halt. She looked ahead with surprise and suspicion on her face.

“What’s wrong?” Yun Che glanced at her.

“This presence...” She released her divine perception, and her suspicion turned into conviction. “It’s Qingxiao’s aura.”

“Qingxiao?”

“He’s my youngest brother.” Hua Caili grabbed Yun Che’s wrist. “Although he’s the youngest, he’s 4,800 years old. I didn’t expect him to be here.”

4,800 years old... the youngest...

Hua Caili awakened her divinity at the age of ten.

Hua Fuchen, the Heart Painter Divine Regent, really is a devoted man.

“Let’s go meet him, big brother Yun.”

Hua Caili was just about to stand up when Yun Che grabbed her. “Wait.”

When Hua Caili turned around to look at him, he explained, “It’s best if our relationship is kept a secret for now.”

“I understand,” Hua Caili said seriously before Yun Che could explain further. “If we publicize our relationship immediately, we would be ripping the Boundless Kingdom of God’s dignity to shreds and ruining Father and the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God’s reputation. That is why Father is the one who should hear this first. He deserves to have the time to accept, think, and respond appropriately to this situation.”

Her statement was clear and logical.

She knew what their relationship entailed from the very beginning. Even so, her determination was unwavering.

“I’m glad to hear that.” Yun Che smiled and fell silent once more. Together, they flew toward the city ahead of them.

“Qingxiao is a soft, obedient boy. He was just four or five years old when I returned to the Kingdom of God at the age of ten. He was very cute, and I share a great relationship with him. But for some reason, Father doesn’t seem to like him much.”

Hua Caili’s words caused the corners of Yun Che’s lips to curl into a mysterious smile. “Ah. That means that your younger brother’s true face is different from the one you know.”

“Huh?” Hua Caili did not understand what he meant.

It wasn’t long before the aura Hua Caili was seeking had entered their vision range.

His aura was so strong, so ostentatiously displayed, that it was impossible to miss.

Yun Che stopped in his tracks and said, “If you head there now, you might be able to see his ‘other’ face.”

Hua Caili thought for a moment before withdrawing her aura. Then, she snuck forward without a sound.

There was a loud noise as a silhouette was flung ten meters away by a slap. It was followed by an angry shout, “The gall of you, you traitorous cur!”

The slapped man was dressed nobly and exuded a powerful aura. It was clear that he possessed great power and standing. Despite this, he did not dare to reveal a hint of anger or hatred on his face. He hurriedly climbed to his feet, but instead of standing up, he half-knelt on the floor and begged meekly, “Please calm down, Divine Son Xiao. This Yi would never dare to disrespect you even if my audacity knew no bounds.”

The surrounding elders and disciples were all wearing ugly expressions, but no one dared to step forward and defend their sect master.

“Hah!” Hua Qingxiao slowly walked up to the kneeling middle-aged man and looked down on him. “Is that so? Then why did you offer that Crimson Profound Abyssal Crystal to Father instead of giving it to me directly? Did you know He gave it to that bitch, Hua Lianzhi?!”

“No, no!” Sect Master Yi hurriedly explained, “This Yi specifically mentioned that the Abyssal Crystal was to be delivered to you , Divine Son. But—”

Hua Qingxiao swung his leg again and kicked Sect Master Yi to the ground.

“Fool!” His eyes were vicious, and his words carved into Sect Master Yi like blades. “All offerings go to the treasury, and once something has entered the treasury, only Father and the Sword Sovereigns[1] may decide their distribution! A single Crimson Profound Abyssal Crystal is worth a 50 kg ordinary Abyssal Crystal, and you think they would give it to me?! Do you really think I don’t know what you’re plotting?!”

“You seem to have forgotten who’s the one who facilitated your decrepit sect’s entry into our Kingdom of God, Sect Master Yi.”

“No, Divine Son Xiao! I would never.” Sect Master Yi shivered like a leaf, afraid to show even the slightest hint of disrespect. “I admit that I haven't thought things through regarding the matter of the Crimson Profound Abyssal Crystal. I admit that I deserve ten thousand deaths. I only beg that you show mercy and leave our barrier untouched, or else countless people are going to fall to abyssal dust.”

The old man standing behind Hua Qingxiao was frowning. He had been frowning since the very beginning. Still, he did not say anything.

He was carrying an ancient sword. It marked him as a sword attendant.

Hua Qingxiao side-eyed him coldly. “We were acquaintances, so I’m not so cruel that I would sentence an entire sect to death. This Divine son will give you one chance, Sect Master Yi.”

“One hundred years. In one hundred years, you will find me a Crimson Profound Abyssal Crystal. I don’t care what you need to do to get it—hunt it at the Endless Fog, buy it, steal it, kill for it—but you will give me a Crimson Profound Abyssal Crystal before a hundred years is up. Do you understand?”

Deep bitterness flashed across Sect Master Yi’s face, but he didn’t dare to refute Hua Qingxiao. He replied with his head bowed, “As you command. I will... do my best.”

“Good. Also...” Hua Qingxiao suddenly turned around and looked at a beautiful woman hiding at the farthest end of the crowd. She was looking at the sect master with a deeply worried and fearful expression. “Your daughter seems nice. I want her as my bed warmer tonight.”

Sect Master Yi abruptly looked up, his pained and terrified expression instantly contorting into something unspeakable. “Divine Son Xiao, this is all my fault. It has nothing to do with my daughter, so please—”

There was a loud bang, and Sect Matser Yi was sent flying again.

Hua Qingxiao waved his hand casually while wearing a disdainful sneer on his face. “ Cur . It is your honor that this Divine Son deems your daughter worthy, and you would spurn my kind offer? I think you have a death wish after—”

Suddenly, he cut himself off. His gaze grew distant.

He saw a woman slowly walking toward him. Her figure was slender, and she was wearing a plain white dress. She wasn’t wearing any jewelry whatsoever. Despite this, her beauty still stole his soul in an instant.

She was wearing a white veil that covered half of her face, but her skin was like jade, and her eye were like stars. They shone like the prettiest light of god in the world.

He was stupefied for a few breaths. Then, he gulped and said with undisguised lust, “To think that this tiny city would have... such...”

His voice weakened, and the unbridled lust in his pupils swiftly turned into hesitation, then into absolute fear.

The old man behind his back had blanched as well. Shock and doubt kept him from moving a muscle.

“Hua Qingxiao,” Hua Caili said coldly, “Since when did you become ‘Divine Son Xiao’?”

Hua Caili’s voice was as melodious as a celestial despite the iceberg behind it. Right now though, Hua Qingxiao was in no mood to enjoy it. He was so scared it would not be a surprise if his soul literally departed his body.

“El... El... El...” He stammered. It was an appellation he was most familiar with, and yet it took him ages to finish it as if someone was grabbing his throat, “Elder sister...”

Hua Caili waved her hand, and an invisible profound energy shot through the air.

It was a slap multiple times louder than the one before. Hua Qingxiao let out a blood curdling scream, and bloody spittle and teeth flew everywhere. He landed several kilometers away and writhed uncontrollably on the ground, unable to stand up for a very long time.

Sect Master Yi and everyone in the sect felt like they were dreaming. They did not dare to even draw a deep breath.

Hua Caili turned away and uttered in an even colder voice, “Remember to address me as ‘Your Highness’ from hereon. You no longer have the right to call me elder sister.”

Her back facing toward the old man, she called out, “Elder Cen.”

The sword-bearing old man slowly knelt on the ground. “This old slave... knows his crime. Please punish me, Your Highness.”

“Take him to the Disciplinary Pavilion and turn yourselves in—before I inform Father about this, if you know what’s good for you.”

“As you command.” The old man did not dare to waste a single word.

“Also, this sect shall be absolved of all offerings for the next thousand years to come. No one will lay a hand on these people either. Get lost as soon as the barrier is rebuilt!”

Hua Caili was far away by the time she finished her sentence.

The old man did not dare to get up even after she had disappeared into the horizon. He was withholding a mountain of shock, however.

This aura and pressure... could she be... a Half-God already...?

“I’m so angry, angry, angry, angry!!”

Hua Caili was grabbing Yun Che’s hand and flinging it back and forth at least a dozen times. Still, she wasn’t satisfied until she bit him in the wrist just hard enough to leave behind a clear tooth print. Only then did she feel a little better.

“Ow ow ow ow...” Yun Che grimaced in an exaggerated fashion. “I’m not the one who angered you. Why are you biting me?”

“Hmph!” Hua Caili still wasn’t appeased. “If one day you make me angry like him, I swear I’ll bite it off, you hear me?!”

“...” Every hair on Yun Che’s person stood on end instantly.

“He was such a good, gentle boy... why did he turn out like this?” More than anger, she was drowning in a pool of sorrow.

Yun Che consoled her gently, “You are surprised because you are too young; too inexperienced. Most people wear different faces in different places. Trust me, they are so different you wouldn’t believe it was possible.”

Hua Caili looked up to stare at him.”Do you have another ‘face’ as well, big brother Yun?”

“Of course!” Yun Che raised his eyebrows. “My other face is super scary, you know?”

“Oh?” But Hua Caili was excited. She cupped his face with both hands and kneaded them lightly. “How scary? Show me!”

“Ahem!” Yun Che turned serious and assumed a vicious pair of eyes. “I once ordered the massacre of an entire realm without batting an eye. I had bled thousands of realms dry and terrified tens of thousands more.”

“Wah! That’s amazing!” Hua Caili played the support role perfectly as she asked, “Does that mean you’re one of those... ‘Devil God of Calamity’ that is described in the picture books?”

Yun Che nodded seriously. “That’s an accurate description. However, I prefer others to address me as ‘Devil Master.’”

“Pff!” Hua Caili couldn’t handle Yun Che’s straight and stern expression any longer and burst out laughing. It wasn’t until later that she realized that she had forgotten her anger.

“Is that amusing to you?” Yun Che wore a helpless expression. “My other face is a Devil God of Calamity. Aren’t you scared?”

“I am! I’m so~ scared~” Hua Caili wrapped her arms around his waist and smiled into his eyes. “So, my dear Devil Master, when are we going to damn the world?”
