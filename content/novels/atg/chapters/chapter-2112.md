As soon as Yun Che stepped out of his cultivation space, he immediately saw Meng Kongchan waiting for him with his hands clasped behind his back. It was impossible to say how long he had been waiting for him.

“How is your progress?” Meng Kongchan turned around and asked casually.

“It’s passable,” Yun Che replied respectfully. “Have you come because the Pure Land Meet is near, Divine Regent?”

"There’s no hurry. One cannot enter the Pure Land early anyway. We will depart in three days.” Meng Kongchan chuckled. “But before that, there is something I need to warn you about.”

Yun Che said seriously, “Please speak, Divine Regent.”

Meng Kongchan hadn’t lowered his voice, but no one beyond ten meters of them could hear a word of their conversation, “Do you remember the time you showed off a Primal Flame Crystal? After that, I commanded the nine Dream Halls to keep its existence a secret.”

Astonished, Yun Che said thoughtfully, “Could it be...”

To him, the Primal Flame Crystal was just one of the many types of mutated abyssal crystals he found in the Endless Fog. Before that incident, he didn’t know what it was called.

“Mm.” Meng Kongchan nodded slightly. “There is a High Priest in the Pure Land who needs it.”

Yun Che’s heart skipped a beat.

“If I hadn't suppressed the news immediately, someone from the Pure Land would have shown up to take it.”

Meng Kongchan specifically used the word “take”, not “request”. After all, who would dare to reject a High Priest?

“The High Priest would be indebted to you in either case, but I’m sure you can see the difference,” He said smilingly. “On one hand, the debt would be shared between you and the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God. On the other hand, you would win her attention and even her good graces. It will be hugely beneficial for your future.”

Yun Che nodded gratefully. “I understand. Thank you for your painstaking efforts, Divine Regent. If I may ask, who is this High Priest who requires the Primal Flame Crystal?”

“High Priest Ling Xian.” Meng Kongchan explained, “High Priest Ling Xian is one of the three ancient flame gods and the daughter of the Vermillion Bird Spirit—though not strictly. What I mean is that her father is the Vermillion Bird Spirit, and her mother is the Thunder Cloud Immortal Bird. As a result, she was born with three elemental divine powers—fire, thunder and wind. Unfortunately, she was also deeply disturbed by it. Her wind and thunder rebelled against her, and her flame ate away at her heart.”

Yun Che: “...”

“Later, she accidentally obtained a Primal Flame Crystal and discovered that it could easily suppress the backlash of the flame of the Vermillion Bird. As fire was her main power, she easily weathered the backlash of her minor elements. Unfortunately, the suppression of the Primal Flame Crystal was not permanent, and the backlash began anew once it ran out of energy.”

“For countless years, High Priest Ling Xian has searched high and low for the Primal Flame Crystal. She jotted down its characteristics to the finest details and announced her search for it time and time again. That was why most people could probably recognize the Primal Flame Crystal at first glance despite not having seen it before.”

Meng Kongchan sighed. “The Primal Flame Crystal back then was like a dream. Never has a second Primal Flame Crystal appeared since. This is a heaven-given opportunity, Yuan’er. You must grasp it.”

Yun Che was far more sensitive toward the name “Vermillion Bird” than Meng Kongchan knew.

Of the Three Supreme Fire Attribute Beasts, Yun Che had made contact with two of them and received many boons as a result. However, he had never encountered any remnant of the Vermillion Bird before. The closest thing to them was the Vermillion Bird Sect of the Flame God Realm. The descendants' bloodline was extremely diluted, and divine arts were incomplete and missing.

According to the ancient records of the God Realm, the Vermillion Bird was the first flame god of the three to go extinct.

If High Priest Ling Xian, one of the four High Priests of the Pure Land, really was the daughter of the Vermillion Bird, then... the Vermillion Bird lineage had not actually gone extinct. Instead, they had survived in the Abyss to this day!

As the bearer of the phoenix and the golden crow’s flame, Yun Che knew very well why the powerful High Priest Ling Xian was experiencing elemental backlashes.

Back when the Golden Crow Spirit had bestowed him with the Golden Crow Inheritance, it had forcefully demanded that he strip himself of all traces of the phoenix’s bloodline.

It was because this was a matter of pride of an ancient flame god and a Supreme Fire Attribute Beast. It could not tolerate even the existence of another divine flame, much less other elements.

His Ancestral Holy Body was the one body in the world that could tame every form of power in the entire universe.

In this regard, High Priest Ling Xian was destined for hardships from the moment she was born.

“As for how you are going to request an audience with High Priest Ling Xian...” Meng Kongchan smiled meaningfully. “That is easy since you have Caili.”

There was no one in all six Kingdoms of God who did not know that Hua Caili was High Priest Ling Xian’s favorite. The sea of colorful flowers in Hua Caili’s backyard had been given by High Priest Ling Xian herself.

“Got it!” Yun Che responded with a smile of his own. “I will make sure to grasp this opportunity.”

“Haha, I’m confident that you’ll succeed. After all, you could even make Qing... ahem, your aunt see you in a new light. High Priest Ling Xian has no choice but to like you.”

“Rest and prepare for the next few days. Then, I will take you to the Pure Land.” He turned around when a wistful thought suddenly struck him. “Yuan’er, I am very glad that you are able to interact peacefully and cordially with Jianxi. You have no idea how worried I was before I had you and Jianxi. Even in my dreams I was worrying about the future of Dreamweaver. But now... all that worry has morphed into gratitude.”

“Right now, my biggest wish is for the two of you to be safe and sound; that no more disasters will befall you two. Progress and cultivation are great, but nothing is more important than your safety.”

He cast Yun Che a sideways glance and accidentally caught a glimpse of the soul ring engraved to Yun Che’s little finger... Of course he hoped that the soul ring would never break.

“This junior will remember the divine regent’s teachings deeply,” Yun Che said seriously. “Don’t worry, Divine Regent. I cherish my life far more than you can imagine. I will never willingly place myself in danger.”

Meng Kongchan nodded smilingly and prepared to leave.

“Wait, Divine Regent. This junior... has a gift for you.”

Meng Kongchan turned around in confusion and saw a rare look of trepidation on Yun Che’s face. He was holding a pendant with a red crystal, a blue crystal, and a yellow crystal on it.

“What is this?”

Yun Che said in a hurry, “Master once told me that the collision of Brahma Sound Stones could cleanse one’s soul. It is most beneficial for a soul cultivator. I happened to have a few Brahma Sound Stones on hand, so I decided to make this pendant to alleviate some of my gratitude toward you... I hope you won’t mind its shoddy craftsmanship.”

Meng Kongchan’s eyes flickered a little before he accepted it. He said smilingly, “I am more than happy to accept your gift.”

He immediately tied the pendant to his waist. As he moved, the stones collided with one another and emitted melodious, soulful sounds.

“Mm! I love it! Hahahaha!” He barked out a laugh and finally turned to leave.

Meng Zhiyuan hurriedly caught up to the Dreamless Divine Regent and escorted him to the palace entrance.

A breeze blew and caused the Brahma Stones to collide once more. It was at this moment Meng Kongchan commented, “These things really do cleanse the soul. I can’t believe how much better I feel just listening to them.”

Meng Zhiyuan chuckled on the inside as she replied respectfully, “Young master would be most happy to hear this, Divine Regent. I should tell you something though. The young master made it sound like he acquired these Brahma Sound Stones with no effort, but in reality... it was the opposite.”

“Oh?” Meng Kongchan stopped in his tracks and looked back, gesturing for her to continue.

Meng Zhiyuan bowed her head and continued a bit nervously, “The young master only had one crimson Brahma Sound Stone at the beginning. However, he believed that only by gathering three different-colored stones could the collisions produce a perfect, heart-cleansing Brahma sound. In order to find a yellow and a blue Brahma Sound Stone, the young master ordered the men to look for it about two years ago. The search never stopped until last month when the final Brahma Sound Stone was discovered. He did not hesitate to pay a mutated abyssal crystal for it.”

Meng Kongchan: “...”

Meng Zhiyuan snuck a look before continuing, “You may not know this, Divine Regent, but the young master has always been extraordinarily grateful and respectful toward you. He also carries a lot of guilt. He often complains that he is unable to recall his old name and so could not address you as Father from the bottom of his heart. That is why he feels guilty, especially considering everything you’ve done for him.”

“You are the supreme one. There is nothing in the world that is up to your standards. Thankfully, the young master’s delicious food delights you, which is why the second most common activity young master performs besides cultivating is cooking.”

“He does not allow anyone to help him when he cooks, which is why every snack you eat, every soup you drink is filled with his pure, unadulterated sincerity.”

“...” Meng Kongchan remained still for a few breaths after Meng Zhiyuan had finished her story. It was only then that he departed without a word.

He would walk for a long time before he looked up at the clouds with faint mist in his eyes.

“It’s enough...” he whispered, “Even if you could never address me as ‘Father’, it is enough...”

When Meng Zhiyuan returned to the palace, she immediately saw that Yun Che was standing nearby. She hurriedly walked up to him and said a bit timidly, “Young master, I'm only a servant girl but took the initiative to praise you in front of the Divine Regent just now. If... you think I have overstepped, then please mete out my punishment.”

Yun Che smiled gently. “In my Divine Son Palace, there is nothing that can’t be said unless there are specific orders not to, so what are you talking about?”

Yun Che had never put on airs in front of his subordinates, much less gotten angry with them. That was why at least ninety percent of Meng Zhiyuan’s timidness—which wasn’t a lot to begin with—was fake. As soon as she received Yun Che’s reply, she immediately broke into a wide grin and asked boldly, “Can I really say anything, young master? In that case... May I ask when you are finally going to love me?”

She refused to look away from Yun Che’s eyes.

Yun Che was still smiling. Meng Zhiyuan’s eyes sparkled with hope when he raised his hand... but instead of her face, it landed on her head instead. He gave her an affectionate head rub as he said, “Your life is just beginning, little one. You should never seek to bind your life to a bad person.”

Meng Zhiyuan pouted with undisguised disappointment, “If the young master is a bad person, then there is no good person in this entire world.”

“That’s why you’re a little one.” Yun Che’s expression did not change. Hidden deep within his pupils was a sea of darkness Meng Zhiyuan would never truly understand.

His fingers lifted away from the girl’s head, and Yun Che turned around to leave.

Meng Zhiyuan stared at his back and called out with determination, “I know that I am humble, and I don't seek to have an official status. All I ask is the honor to serve you in this lifetime, young master...”

She knew very well that she did not have the right to love him as an equal. All she asked was the right to stay by his side forever.

She wasn’t expecting a response, but Yun Che said, “A lifetime is long, Zhiyuan. You must not use the word lightly. A paper kite (Zhiyuan) is small, but it can still ride the winds and soar high in the sky. Never seek to bind your life so carelessly.”

Meng Zhiyuan stood still. She would not say a word for a very long time.

The Dreamweaver Divine Ship floated into the air, and the aura emanating from within drew the attention of the entire Dreamweaver Kingdom of God.

Meng Kongchan was standing at the bow with the nine Lords of Nine Dream Halls. Behind them were the most outstanding juniors of their Dream Halls.

Without exaggeration, the key figures of this generation and the next were all in one place.

In Yun Che’s opinion though, the fact that only a hundred people out of the entire Kingdom of God could enter the Pure Land... seemed to hint that the Pure Land was far more miserly than they were made out to be.

After the giant ship rose into the air, it flew straight toward the Pure Land.

Yun Che was currently standing right next to Meng Jianxi.

Meng Jianxi explained smilingly, “Brother Yuan, this is the first time you've left the kingdom after you returned home, isn’t it? It doesn’t look like you are too excited though.”

“When I was wandering, all of the world was and wasn’t my home. That's why my taste and expectation toward a new, unknown frontier have long since diminished. But of course, the Pure Land doesn’t fall under this category.”

Yun Che asked with a curious expression, “Have you met the Abyssal Monarch before, Divine Son Yuan?”

“One time, yes.”

Just like everyone else, Meng Jianxi immediately adopted a reverent expression when he spoke of the Abyssal Monarch. “In my imagination, the Abyssal Monarch is an imposing yet merciful man. His monarchical aura is unparalleled, and His mere presence causes all living beings to cower in fear and submission.”

“When I actually met Him in person though, I realized that the Abyssal Monarch was nothing like who I imagined Him to be.”

“Really?” Yun Che looked very doubtful.

Meng Jianxi looked hesitant, but he ultimately said, “This might sound offensive, but when I met the Abyssal Monarch, I... could not feel any aura or imposingness from him. I couldn’t even feel any emotional changes from him at all... even when he was smiling.”

Yun Che: “...”

“To me, the Abyssal Monarch feels like a drifter who is disassociated from the world,” Meng Jianxi voiced his honest thoughts of the Abyssal Monarch directly. “Maybe it’s because the Abyssal Monarch truly exists in a plane the likes of me cannot possibly understand. It's to the point where even ‘perception’ becomes impossible.”

“In contrast, the Chief Priest was far, far more imposing and scary than Father. You best be prepared for a shock when you face him.”

The two men were chatting casually and exchanging smiles with each other like close brothers. It was a sight that made the Dream Lords feel quite complicated.

“Ai.” Meng Cangji let out a long sigh inside his heart. What could he do if Meng Jianxi was determined not to fight against Yun Che?

“Speaking of which, Father is going to be absolutely ecstatic when we reach the Pure Land, Brother Yuan. It’s all because of you, of course,” Meng Jianxi said from the heart. He did not care that Meng Kongchan was within hearing range of their conversation.

Meng Kongchan was currently standing at the bow and gazing forward. His appearance was perfect, and he did not react to Meng Jianxi’s remark at all.

Yun Che replied humbly, “I’m just a Divine Master who does not deserve anyone’s eyes in the Pure Land. I am participating as a humble follower seeking to broaden his horizons. In the end, the one who must show off the true strength of my Dreamweaver Kingdom of God is you, Divine Son Xi.”

Meng Jianxi shook his head with a bitter smile on his lips. “You underestimate the power of perfect divine essence too much. As for me... it is going to be difficult.”

Suddenly, Meng Kongchan glanced toward the east. Then, he made a hand gesture and altered both the energies and the trajectory of the ship. It began to move east.

Very soon, another giant profound ark emanating an immense aura entered their vision.

“The Heaven Breaker Star Ship,” Meng Jianxi remarked. “It’s the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God.”

The two profound arks rapidly closed the distance until they were seamlessly joined with one another.

“Har har, what a coincidence, Dreamless Divine Regent.”

“Coincidence? More like predestined, considering the karma between us! Hahahahaha!”

The two Divine Regents approached one another. Hua Fuchen’s smile did not quite reach the eye, and Meng Kongchan’s laugh was as loud as it was meaningful.

Yun Che’s gaze swept across Hua Fuchen and landed on the young woman standing beside him. For a few brief instances, he was actually lost in her appearance.

It had only been three years since they last met, and yet it looked like she had undergone a complete transformation.
