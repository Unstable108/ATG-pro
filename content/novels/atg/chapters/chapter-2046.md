“Buwang,” the middle-aged man behind Pray Eternal Divine Regent said, “You do not need to be this way.”

“Buwang... Buwang (Modest)? Hahaha... hahahahaha!” Pan Buwang lifted his head and laughed like a madman, uncaring of the fact that his jar of wine had spilled over his person. “Just listen to the title my dear Father bestowed me back when I became a Divine Son. He truly is a man of acute foresight, is he not? Now that I have become one with the mud, Father will never have to worry about arrogance or imbecility from me ever again... hehahahaha!”

Pan Yusheng’s face grew darker and darker. It was to the point where black qi was rising between his eyebrows. The middle-aged man hurriedly took half a step forward and gave him a calming look. Then, he said, “You may not be a Divine Son anymore, Buwang, but the thought of abandoning you has never crossed your Father’s mind. If he truly has discarded you, then why would he—”

“Shut up, you old thing.”

Pan Buwang side-eyed the middle-aged man with a slanted grin dripping with scorn. “Back then, you swore that you would support me with your life for as long as you lived. But when Pan Buzhuo stepped on my head, you did not even give me a single fart. You think you have the right to educate me?" Spit!

Pan Buwang actually spat a glob of smelly, alcoholic saliva at the duo.

There were few people in the Abyss who hadn’t heard the name Pan Buwang.

After all, it was the name of the Divine Son of the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God.

That was all in the past though.

Every generation, the Six Kingdoms of God of the Abyss would spare no effort in locating the next God Bearer. Every time they succeeded, the entire Kingdom of God would throw the greatest celebration.

This generation though, multiple God Bearers had awakened their divine essence in multiple Kingdoms of God.

The Eternal Night Kingdom of God and the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God were two such examples. Even the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God, the weakest Kingdom of God due to their unusual rarity of Godbearers, had discovered their second God Bearer in an unbelievably short amount of time.

Their first God Bearer was Pan Buwang. His conferral ceremony had been one that shook the world and was even attended by the Abyssal Monarch himself. This was an unparalleled honor that no other Divine Son or Divine Daughter had ever enjoyed.

Unfortunately, just two thousand years later, the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God welcomed its second God Bearer. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it was one whose divine essence and talent surpassed Pan Buwang’s.

To a Kingdom of God, the inheritance of a True God surpassed everything. Naturally, only the most outstanding God Bearer was qualified to become a Divine Son or Daughter.

The Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God had never welcomed two God Bearers in the same generation until then. As a result, Pan Buwang became the first ever Divine Son to be deposed in the history of the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God.

Once upon a time, he was naive enough to think that he would simply return to his previous life after he was deposed. That lasted until reality stomped him into the abyss.

Once upon a time, he possessed the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God’s greatest limelight and enjoyed a level of authority and resources others dared not even dream of. His brothers, sisters, and even elders had treated him with absolute deference and respect, going so far as to bend the knee just to garner his favor.

When he suddenly fell from the pinnacle, it was as if all those experiences had suddenly become the greatest shame of everyone who once curried favor with him. They began insulting, ridiculing, and even trampling over him twofold as if attempting to make up for all the humility and fawning they did before.

Besides, it was obvious that the new Divine Son would view the former Divine Son as a threat. The more they trampled him, the deeper they sank him into the mud, the more the new Divine Son and future Owl Butterfly Divine Regent would favor them, right?

“Disgraceful!”

Pan Yusheng finally could not restrain his anger anymore and lashed out.

There was a loud slap, and Pan Buwang was sent flying through the air. A pillar of blood gushed out of his mouth.

Pan Yusheng’s palm tensed. He did not think that Pan Buwang would take his slap without any resistance whatsoever.

Once upon a time, Pan Buwang was his favorite son; the one he took more pride in than any other. Pan Yusheng was not a heartless man, so how could he view his once favorite son like nothing? He regretted his outburst the second he lashed out against Pan Buwang. However, he was a Divine Regent. He could not show weakness no matter where he was, so he let out a cold, heavy hmph instead.

Pan Buwang rolled across the floor several times before he finally came to a stop. He threw up several mouthfuls of blood uncontrollably as he lay on the ground. When he finally lifted his head though, his grin only grew increasingly maddened and scornful, “Hehehe... So sorry to make a busy man like you personally teach this useless son of yours a lesson, Father. Hehehehehe...”

Pan Buwang was throwing up flecks of blood with nearly every word he spoke. Pan Yusheng looked away and softened his tone a tad, “I know you are aggrieved, Buwang, but the Kingdom of God’s inheritance is more important than anything. You should understand this...”

“I understand. Of course I understand.”

Pan Buwang slowly climbed to his feet. “I would be lying if I said that I have no negative feelings toward my deposition, but I definitely harbor neither ill will nor hatred toward the decision either. You’re right. The Kingdom of God’s inheritance is more important than anything. Should a Godbearer more outstanding than me exist, of course he should become the new Godbearer instead! Of course I should surrender my position to him!”

“I can even accept those who used to prostrate themselves before me like they are the dirt beneath my feet doing everything in their power to destroy my dignity and honor a thousand fold. I may not be a Divine Son anymore, but I am still one who has awakened my divine essence. Given enough time and effort, my achievements will surely shut their mouths and make them regret their disgusting reactions a thousandfold.”

Pan Buwang abruptly looked up, and his eyes turned as scarlet as the blood trickling down his mouth. “But why... kill my mother?!”

Pan Yusheng declared gravely, “I told you already! Your mother became mentally ill because the fall from grace was too much for her to bear! That is why she committed suicide. It has nothing to do with anyone... and definitely not the current Divine Empress!”

“Hehahahaha!” Pan Buwang let out a tragic laugh. “Do you even hear yourself?”

“For Pan Buzhuo, that bitch dared to steal my Four Phase Demonic Crystal only to be caught by my mother. Considering the severity of her crimes, it would have been right to cripple her entire clan and sentence them all to exile.”

“My mother was a kind woman, and as a mother, she understood why that bitch had done what she did. So, she only took her arms as punishment. She never publicized this matter, and she never told you about it.”

“Unfortunately, that bitch harbored a deep grudge against my mother. Since the very first day she became Divine Empress, she insulted and shamed my mother in every way...”

His teeth cracked from how hard he was gritting them. “It's true that she couldn’t kill my mother with her own hands, but she is the Divine Empress. One word... one glance is all she needed to get someone to do her dirty work for her! Do you really not know about this, or are you... just pretending, Father ?!”

“Enough!” Pan Yusheng did not want to listen to this any further. “It does not matter either way, not to me or this Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God. This is the hand fate has dealt you, so you should just accept it.”

“One more thing,” his tone and posture overflowed with the coldness and cruelty of an undefiable regent. “Do not think I do not know why you are acting like this. Yes, your mother is one reason, but it is also because of what happened to Shen Wuqing, the Eternal Night Divine Daughter who got deposed, isn’t it?!”

The second the name “Shen Wuqing” entered his ears, the crazed Pan Buwang froze like he had been struck by thunder.

“To think that you, a former Owl Butterfly Divine Son, would abandon yourself to this extent for two women! This alone disqualifies you of the title ‘Divine Son’!”

He let out another heavy hmph before flicking his sleeves and walking away.

A long time later, the middle-aged man finally spoke up again, “Your Majesty, Buwang is acting like this really because he cannot adjust to his fall from grace...”

“Do not speak of him any longer.” Pan Yusheng raised a hand to stop him. “If he wishes to rot, then he may rot forever. From now on, you need not pay him any attention.”

“Sigh... very well.” The middle-aged man nodded. “I suppose it’s not completely a bad thing. At the very least, there is no worry that he will compete against Buzhuo and potentially destabilize things.”

Pan Yusheng did not say anything, but it was clear that he agreed.

After Pray Eternal Divine Regent was gone, Pan Buwang collapsed on the floor and lay there for a very, very long time. One who did not know better would think that he was a drunkard who drank himself to death.

The only things that showed he was still alive were the blood on his mouth, and the tears flowing out of his eyes.

Wuqing... Wuqing...

Your name means Heartless, and they all say that you are a demoness who should never be approached...

When I fell from grace and hit the dirt, when everyone—my brothers, my sisters, those I once thought were my friends, and even Father—pitied me, ridiculed me, and trampled over me...

You were the only one whose eyes did not change despite my downfall... you were the only one who reached out and grabbed my hand when I was lying in the mud... you were the only one who truly believed me when I told you that my mother was killed by that bitch...

Did you know? Most of me was in shock and pain when I heard that you were deposed just like me, but there was one part of me... one tiny, despicable part of me... that couldn’t help but be overjoyed. After all, we would have been of equal status. Our relationship would not have met nearly as much resistance as before.

But why...

How could you leave me forever...

Wuqing... Wuqing... you really are heartless, aren’t you?

Is this our destiny?

Was our relationship really just a meek, pitiful, fantastical dream that may never come true...?

A dream...

His murky eyes finally regained a bit of clarity.

He slowly got up to his feet, his movement slow like a dead branch that was being dragged through mud.

Dream... Dreamweaver...

He lifted his head and looked into the distance. There, the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God lay.

A dream is fine. Let me see you one more time, Wuqing...

Yun Che was sitting cross legged on the ground with his eyes tightly shut. With Hua Caili to guard him, he did not need to worry about his surroundings.

Since he started journeying together with Hua Caili, he no longer cultivated his power. Instead, he focused on perceiving the flow of abyssal dust and improving his compatibility with it during his meditations.

Of course, no one could detect this process. No one could even understand it.

“Young master Yun! I think I’ve gained a new insight! Help me!”

Suddenly, a heavenly melodious voice rang beside his ears, and before he knew it, an unnaturally smooth and soft hand grabbed his wrist and pulled him to his feet.

It was so natural you wouldn’t know what was wrong with it.

Dancing like a butterfly, the young woman thrust her Glazed Cloud Sword at Yun Che. The strike looked as light as a feather and perfectly soundless, but it really carried the weight of a thousand sword intents. She was clearly excited and eager to show off her minor breakthrough.

The corners of Yun Che’s lips curled up slightly. Without a word, he swung the Heaven Smiting Devil Slayer Sword and dealt with the myriad variations of Hu Caili’s sword using brute force.

It was hardest to break the “taboo” the first time. After that, one’s “bottom line” would keep fading until it seemed like the most natural thing in the world to do.

That was the case for the intimate contact between him and Hua Caili.

As of late, Hua Caili spent at least three quarters of an hour or so gripping Yun Che’s arm and doing her best to perceive his so-called “Sword Intent of Nothingness.”

She had gone from someone whose every hair on her body was protected and sheltered to the extreme, to someone who could grab Yun Che’s hand and force him to train with her without any resistance.

Heavy sword versus light sword, strength versus skill. The clash between the two different powers generated beautiful lights and howling storms inside the dark space of the Endless Fog.

Hua Qingying watched silently. She could clearly sense Hua Caili improving at a faster rate ever since she began journeying together with Yun Che.

Is Yun Che’s sword intent really that beneficial to her?

There was a deafening boom, and Yun Che’s violent sword might was split into a thousand wisps. The resulting shockwave caused their clothes to flap furiously in the air.

Their swords touching, the two swordsmen stared into each other’s eyes for a moment. Hua Caili beamed at Yun Che, saying, “So? My sword has a lot more variations than before, doesn't it?”

She did not receive Yun Che’s affirmation and praise as she used to. The young man was staring at her blankly as if he hadn’t heard her at all.

At first, Hua Caili did not understand why he was acting like this. Then, she realized something and touched her face... only to find that the veil that usually covered it was nowhere to be found.

The earlier clash had actually cut her veil loose. As a result, Yun Che was exposed to the most beautiful face in the Abyss at close range.

Still in a daze, he murmured seemingly to himself, “I finally understand... what they mean by the moon in the sky... the snow between the clouds...”

The young woman subconsciously covered her mouth after failing to find her veil, but her panic lasted a surprisingly short while. She removed her hand, curled her lips into a small smile, and stared deeply into the young man’s eyes, saying, “That’s the first time I heard such wonderful praise. As expected of you, Young Master Yun.”

This wasn’t the first time someone had lost themselves in her countenance and showered her with praise. She had long since gotten used to it.

And yet, something felt different about this praise.

For whatever reason, it made her feel... happy like never before.

Yun Che finally regained his wits and hurriedly looked away from Hua Caili’s face. The Heaven Smiting Devil Slayer Sword was also pointed toward the ground. After taking a moment to regain his composure, he finally said in a sincere tone, “I already knew that you would look divine, Sister Qu, but this was...”

For a time, he could not find any word to describe her appearance or his shock.

“You’re the one who looks divine,Young Master Yun,” Hua Caili returned the compliment just as sincerely.

At the very least, the only man she ever knew whose appearance was superior to Yun Che was the one she respected the most after her family, the Abyssal Monarch.

Yun Che shook his head smilingly. “My looks are mortal to say the least. How can you possibly put them on the same pedestal as yours, Sister Qu? If I had never met you, I could not believe that it is possible for a woman to be this beautiful. To call you a miracle... would be an understatement.”

Hua Caili giggled once. With the wave of her hand, she caught the veil that had floated some distance away but did not fix it back on her face. Instead, she put it away and actually leaned closer to Yun Che, a teasing grin dancing on her face. “In that case, I urge you to look at it more and pay me a toll of compliments everyday, hahaha.”

Yun Che broke into a smile himself. “That is probably an honor every man in the world did not even dare to dream of.”

As Hua Caili leaned forward, her vision was encroached by the unnatural red of the Heaven Smiting Devil Slayer Sword. Her gaze shifted slightly as she asked, “I’ve been meaning to ask, but the aura of your sword is quite unusual, Young Master Yun. It is unlike any other sword I have ever seen. What is it called?”

Yun Che answered without hesitation, “It is a gift from my master. Its name is ‘Cloud Glaze’.”

“Eh!?” Hua Caili abruptly looked up with widened eyes.
