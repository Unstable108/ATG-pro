Everyone was dumbstruck for a very, very long time. Meng Kongchan especially felt like his world had just been shattered.

This was a response no one had anticipated. Be it the calm and refined Divine Attendant Su Shang or the casual and careless Divine Attendant Yuan Ying, both were wearing clear expressions of surprise.

The color on Hua Caili’s beautiful face began to fade visibly. She abruptly grabbed Yun Che’s hand and said panickedly, “What are you saying, Big Brother Yun? No way! No way! Absolutely not! Punishment or pardon, we’ll always be together! Don’t even think of throwing me away!”

Every single one of her jade fingers were gripping his tightly. She was afraid that Yun Che would let her go a second time.

“Yuan’er, you... take back what you just said this instant!”

Meng Kongchan roared hurriedly, “This is not the time and place for such nonsense!”

He never imagined that Yun Che would turn what should have been a gift from the heavens into an absolute nightmare. For whatever reason, he had pushed himself into even more profound despair and danger.

Meng Jianxi was beyond caring as well. He took a couple of steps forward and roared at the top of his lungs, “Brother Yuan! Although the punishment of devouring rage is not a death sentence, it is far scarier than you know! It is a punishment that seeps into your blood, flesh, muscles, bones, marrow, and even your soul... every speck of your existence will suffer pain and torment ten thousand times worse than even ten thousand nightmares! It cannot be defended against, and you will desire the sweet release of death long before you reach the end of it!”

“The Xuanji Hall recorded one hundred and seventy six people who received the punishment of devouring rage... but only nine of them survived.”

“Everyone else committed suicide because they couldn’t stand the torture!”

“Of the nine people who survived the punishment, six are at the late-stage Divine Extinction Realm, and the remaining three are at the Divine Limit Realm. This is not the kind of punishment someone like you is meant to endure! Twice the amount... that is just impossible! You absolutely mustn’t!”

“This is the last place and time to put on a brave front, so take back your words right now! You must take it back, if only for Father and the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God’s sake!”

Meng Jianxi’s shout sounded positively tragic by the time it passed the halfway point. He hadn’t told Yun Che anything about the punishment of devouring rage in the past three years. Therefore, he thought that Yun Che had made his decision out of ignorance.

“Yun Che.”

Hua Qingying was a woman of few words, but this time, she broke her silence of her own accord. Countless admirers were sneaking glances at her and listening intently as she said, “I know how much you love Caili, but the punishment of devouring rage is not something you can understand until you’ve experienced it yourself. Listen to your Father and take back your words. With two High Priests pleading on your behalf, I am sure that His Majesty and the High Priest would not punish you too severely.”

Yun Che’s gaze did not waver, however. He continued to look the Abyssal Monarch in the eye and declared, “My mind is made up. I humbly request His Majesty to give face to the two High Priests and fulfill my wish.”

Despite being warned and informed repeatedly about the horror that was the punishment of devouring rage, forget changing his mind, the man hadn’t even hesitated to respond.

“Yuan’er, you...”

“Brother Yuan!!!”

Ripples of emotions washed across Hua Qingying’s eyes. She could not say anything.

“I don’t want this, Big Brother Yun!”

Hua Caili shook her head vigorously. She was grabbing Yun Che’s fingers so hard that her own fingers had become completely bloodless. All of her panic transformed into deep determination as she declared, “I told you already. I won’t let you bear this alone... never.”

The expressions of the profound practitioners of the other Kingdoms of God kept changing. At this point, they found themselves unable to understand what was going on, much less the junior who had just returned to his Kingdom of God, Yun Che. Should they laugh at him for his ignorance? Or should they compliment him for his fearlessness?

“Yun Che.”

She should not have spoken up, considering her standpoint, but Divine Attendant Su Shang said, “I would advise you to change your mind. The punishment of devouring rage is not something one can withstand with ordinary willpower. If you insist on acting like this... I won’t be able to face my master later.” 𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝐰𝚎𝕓𝐧𝚘𝘃𝗲𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝕞

“I agree.”

Divine Attendant Yuan Ying concurred, “Your decision is extraordinarily courageous, so much so that a desireless man like me feels amazement and curiosity, but I really won’t be able to face my master if you act like this. You should plead to receive only half the punishment, or a full pardon for both of you.”

Yun Che turned around and gave them a grateful smile. “I am currently bound, so forgive me for not offering you the courtesy you deserve. Also, please convey my thanks to the two High Priests.”

Su Shang let out a small sigh and gave Yun Che a long look. Then, she lightly bowed in the Abyssal Monarch and the Chief Priest’s direction before departing the scene. Yuan Ying also exhaled before leaving on his cloud.

On his way out, what sounded like a murmur to himself or an exclamation came from Yuan Ying. “No wonder lil Caili fell for him so hard. Dumb or not, this boy has guts in spades.”

The Abyssal Monarch suddenly spoke up, “Tell this lone one. Why are you doing this?”

The Abyssal Monarch never wasted his breath, but right here and now, even he was curious about the reasoning behind the young man’s astonishing decision.

His posture unchanging, Yun Che answered clearly and evenly, “I did commit a grave mistake. No matter what kind of circumstances and helplessness culminated in today’s karma, this is a fact that cannot be changed. Therefore, I neither regret nor resent the punishment I will soon receive.”

“Only by receiving this punishment in full can I truly make up for my crime. Only then can I deserve your mercy, appease the masses, and... reduce the amount of shame Dreamweaver receives because of me.”

Everyone from Dreamweaver was speechless. Even the few Dream Lords who disliked Yun Che for stealing Meng Jianxi’s position before instantly grew teary-eyed when they heard this.

“Yuan’er,” Meng Kongchan shook his head lightly, “Dreamweaver has only ever owed you... There is nothing you can do that can bring shame to us. The biggest fortune I and Dreamweaver can possibly receive is your safety.”

Meng Jianxi was holding back sobs. It took him a while before he was finally able to force out the words, “Brother Yuan, you... you really don’t need to do this...”

All nine Dream Lords were exchanging glances with each other. An endless sea of emotions mixed chaotically inside their eyes and their hearts.

The Abyssal Monarch spoke again, “In that case, you could have asked this lone one to pardon Hua Caili. Why did you choose to bear twice the punishment of devouring rage?”

Yun Che’s eyes grew gentle, and his voice turned soft. “Caili is the most beautiful woman in the world. She erred only because of me. The punishment could be ten times worse, and still I won’t allow her to suffer even the tiniest bit of pain, much less be criticized by the world... That is why I request to receive twice the punishment. Only then can her crime be properly absolved.”

Hua Fuchen lifted his head slightly. It took him a while before he slowly let out a long breath.

Hua Caili continued to shake her head. At this point, her face looked unusually calm, and the light residing in her pupils looked firmer than ever. “Big brother Yun, we have walked even the fine line of death side by side. How can I possibly allow you to endure this alone? It doesn’t matter what punishment it is. I fear nothing with you by my side.”

However, the Abyssal Monarch’s response cruelly snuffed out her wish.

“Very well.”

The Abyssal Monarch looked away and issued his order in an emotionless voice, “Since you are making this request using Ling Xian and Liu Xiao’s favor, this lone one has no reason to turn it down.”

Hua Caili’s expression instantly turned into one of shock and horror. “Uncle Abyssal Monarch, no—”

The Chief Priest was already carrying out His order. He did not move. Only his eyes flashed with an odd light. The next second, the profound light binding Hua Caili crumbled, and a terrible, irresistible force pushed her away... or at least tried to. It was because she was clinging onto Yun Che’s hand with all her might, even though there was the clear, heartbreaking sound of breaking bones.

“Uncle Abyssal Monarch,” she begged with tears streaming down her cheeks. “You’ve always spoiled me... so please, I ask that you let me endure this punishment with him... Uncle Abyssal Monarch!”

Crack! Crack! All five of her dainty fingers were warped at this point. Even now, her finger bones were breaking one by one. Still, she refused to let go.

The Chief Priest issued a heavy warning, “Leave now, or your resistance will be treated as an aggravating circumstance!”

Hua Qingying disappeared and reappeared beside Hua Caili. Gently, she grabbed their intertwined fingers with her snow white, jade-like hand and said, “Caili.”

Her voice sounded completely unfamiliar to most people. It was a gentle voice that she only ever used in front of Hua Caili. “The monarch’s order cannot be changed once given. Do not... waste his feelings.”

“...” Hua Caili’s expression froze for a moment. In the end, Hua Qingying was able to peel her bloodless, now powerless fingers away from Yun Che’s and carry her back to Hua Fuchen. The young woman looked numb and limp as warm, profound energy wrapped around her injured fingers and healed her injuries.

On the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God’s side, Pan Buzhuo was scoffing under his breath, “Tsk!! The guy has no idea what he’s dealing with! He’s going to scream and beg as ugly as he charmed the Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter in a moment... It’s going to be oh-so-ugly.”

Did Pan Buzhuo hold a grudge against Yun Che? Not at all. However, not only was Yun Che’s talent in the profound way one-of-a-kind, the Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter loved him and was even more handsome than he was. As his peer, how could he not be jealous of Yun Che? Dark pleasure naturally coursed through his veins the moment he imagined how ugly the man he was intensely jealous of would look when the punishment of devouring rage began.

Finally, the cruel declaration took place. “Receive your punishment, Yun Che!”

The Chief Priest opened his palm and fired a beam of withering, yellow, profound light at Yun Che. Halfway, it split into countless tiny needles that were as thin as human hair before piercing Yun Che’s limbs, bones, pores, the gap between his bones, and more. The needles would penetrate his skin, flesh, blood, bones, veins, marrow... and even the depths of his soul.

In just an instant, Yun Che’s entire consciousness was consumed by indescribable pain. Impossible itchiness tortured him like a million venomous ants were biting every inch of his bones. Unimaginable pain was skewering every inch of his body like a million poisonous and red-hot needles repeatedly. This was a torturous punishment that could drive even a Half-God to suicide before it was completed. Its cruelty naturally exceeded the ordinary person’s understanding and imagination of pain countless times over.

It felt like lava burning one’s bones into ash... it felt like poisonous vines slowly corroding the heart... it felt like hot branding irons stirring inside his marrow... It felt like his soul was being dragged across a savage wilderness filled with countless pieces of gravel...

Yun Che’s facial features contorted violently, and every joint in his body was spasming so hard that it displaced itself. Horrid-looking blue veins were bulging everywhere as well...

This was just the beginning, though. Soon, every piece of skin and flesh on his body was trembling and undulating like countless abyssal worms were squirming or feeding underneath it... It was every cell in his body contorting and spasming in abject torment.

Barely an instant had passed since the punishment began, but cold sweat had already drenched every inch of Yun Che’s clothes. It then splashed haphazardly on the floor of Eden’s Crown and swiftly spread toward the surroundings like it was raining.

All around him, the bodies and souls of the profound practitioners of the Kingdoms of God began trembling as well. One by one, they looked away from Yun Che. His tortured appearance was such that they could not even bear to look at him.

The terrifyingly visceral physical reactions showed just how painful and torturous the punishment was, and the young man was going to have to endure it for a hundred breaths! No, that wasn’t right. He asked to withstand twice the punishment... so he was going to have to endure this for two hundred breaths!

“Big Brother Yun...”

Tears were streaming endlessly down Hua Caili’s cheeks, and her face was as white as a sheet. If Hua Qingying hadn’t been supporting her, she would have collapsed to the floor the instant the punishment of devouring rage took place. Soul-crushing sobs escaped her bloodless lips again and again.

Meng Kongchan was clutching his heart and feeling as if he could barely breathe, but he gathered his wits, maintained his cool as best he could, and called out to Yun Che again and again. “Hold on, Yuan’er... try listening to my voice... Yuan’er, Yuan’er...”

One breath, two breaths, three breaths, ten breaths! At this point, even the air seemed to be trembling in pain, and the thin, flawless clouds floating in the sky were destroyed by the chilly wind emanated by Yun Che...

It was at this moment that the crowd noticed something astonishing. Despite looking like he was being tortured in the ten thousandth level of purgatory[1], Yun Che... had not cried out even once.

No one noticed this, but a layer of astonishment had colored the Chief Priest’s eyes. He was present for every punishment by devouring rage. Sometimes, he personally carried out the punishment. However, no one... not even the handful of Divine Limit Realm experts who suffered the punishment... was able to withstand ten breaths without uttering a single sound.

Eleven breaths, twelve breaths... fifteen breaths...

At first, everyone wore horrified expressions. However, that horror slowly turned into astonishment, then from astonishment into growing shock and disbelief.

While enduring a terrible heartache, Meng Kongchan continued to call out to Yun Che in an even voice, “There is no need to endure the pain by force, Yuan’er. Feel free to scream all you want. Screaming can decrease the pain a little... It’s really fine, Yuan’er. Just scream as much as you want.

The reason Meng Kongchan was calling out to Yun Che non-stop was in hopes that he could distract Yun Che from the pain and prevent him from suffering a soul collapse. Countless criminals had committed suicide during the punishment because they suffered a total soul collapse.

Meng Jianxi was also shouting, “No one has ever been able to withstand the punishment of devouring rage for so long without uttering a sound, Brother Yuan! As expected of you! You are not only the pride of Dreamweaver. There may not be another person in the entire Abyss who can rival you. So you can endure this... not even twice the punishment of devouring rage can defeat you! I am sure of it!”

Crack! Crack! Crack... The sounds of breaking bones kept coming from Yun Che, but it wasn’t because of the punishment. To be accurate, the punishment of devouring rage did not break one’s body or snap one's bones. However, it could inflict so much pain that the one being tormented would break their bones without noticing. That was what was happening right now. Yun Che was clenching his fists so hard that his fingers were breaking, and bits and pieces of bone were piercing his palm. Blood mixed with sweat dripped on the floor before turning into bloody-smelling white vapor that eventually disappeared into the air.

Hua Qingying reached out and covered Hua Caili’s eyes. “Don’t look, Caili... it will be over soon.”

Hua Caili was trembling almost as hard as Yun Che. The horrifying torture that was being applied to Yun Che was also carving up her heart and soul like ten thousand blades. However, she raised her hands and, despite the tremors wracking her hands, stubbornly pulled her aunt’s hand away. Although her eyes were completely covered in tears, she never stopped looking at Yun Che for even an instant.

“I... want... to... see...” She whispered each word like she was talking in her sleep. This was easily the cruelest picture she had ever seen in her life, and yet she desired to imprint each and every instant into her soul.

Twenty breaths... twenty-five breaths... thirty breaths!

Yun Che’s facial features had completely lost their human shape at this point. Blood and spittle kept pouring out from his tightly clenched teeth. Despite this... he never allowed even a muffled grunt to spill through his nose.

“What stunning willpower,” Sha Xing whispered absentmindedly. With every passing second, Yun Che’s silence was stacking up more and more layers of shock in his heart.

Sha Xing’s voice jolted Xian Yue out of his own reverie and reminded him to breathe. After sucking in a deep breath and exhaling it all, he said from the bottom of his heart, “If this man manages to survive this tribulation... I must make his acquaintance no matter what.”

At a different corner of Eden’s Crown, Shenwu Yi suddenly pressed a hand to her solar plexus and frowned deeply.

What’s going on... why is my heart aching like it’s being stabbed repeatedly... why can’t I stop it or suppress it... did I suffer some internal injuries during my fight against Dian Jiuzhi...

1. There are only eighteen levels of hell in Chinese folklore, so you can imagine what the ten thousandth level looks like. ☜
