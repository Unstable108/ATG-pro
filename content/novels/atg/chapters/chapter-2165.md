Shen Wuyi¹ was placed into the healing profound formation with extreme gentleness. Shen Wuyouluo² set up a simple isolation barrier, and a ball of gentle profound light condensed between her fingers, then slowly circulated over that delicate body. However, Shen Wuyi, who should have been in a deep coma, slowly opened her eyes at this moment. She then struggled to sit up, her movements weak but imbued with a stubborn persistence.

"Wuyi!"

Shen Wuyouluo quickly stepped forward, cradling Shen Wuyi's upper body. "Don't move around. Sink into unconsciousness. The Venerable One³ no longer intends to punish you."

Shen Wuyi did not close her eyes. Instead, she spoke in a voice like a gentle breeze rustling silk: "She... just obtained the Abyssal Heart Vine⁴, and I'm gravely injured... Her gaze isn't here, nor is the Pure Land's⁵ gaze cast upon this place."

Shen Wuyouluo understood her intention. She wanted to persuade Shen Wuyi that whatever it was, it should wait. But considering Shen Wuyi's nature, she knew that unless it was something extremely important, she wouldn't be like this. So, she gently lowered her head, leaning closer to Shen Wuyi's lips. "Alright, speak."

Her bloodless lips parted slightly, murmuring dreamlike words: "Prostrating before the union of heaven and earth, all things transform into purity; male and female in proper union, heaven and earth establish order..."

"...!"

Shen Wuyouluo's head snapped up, her face filled with shock as she looked at Shen Wuyi. It took several breaths for her to barely calm her surging emotions. She lowered her voice and asked, "Wuyi, you... regained your memories?"

Those weak, unfocused moon-like eyes stared fixedly at her. "So... that marriage contract... it really exists..."

Shen Wuyouluo froze, momentarily at a loss.

She could only lower her posture and voice even further, her voice trembling slightly. "Who told you these things? What exactly did you encounter in the Divine Slumber Forbidden Zone⁶?"

Shen Wuyi slowly raised her hand, with immense difficulty pressing her fingers onto Shen Wuyouluo's hand, conveying her resolve. "If it's on you... now... show it to me... now..."

Her breath was so weak that she was completely relying on willpower to forcefully sustain herself, yet she repeated "now" twice. Shen Wuyouluo's expression was complex and hard to describe, and her brief hesitation was undoubtedly an admission.

Just as she was about to speak, she heard Shen Wuyi's soft murmur again: "It... decides my... destiny..."

Shen Wuyouluo had never seen her so persistent. Without further hesitation, she gritted her teeth slightly and quickly reached into her spatial artifact. A moment later, she pulled out a foot-long Abyssal Crystal⁷, emitting a rich Abyssal Crystal aura. With a movement of her hand, the Abyssal Crystal split open, revealing that its interior had been meticulously hollowed out. From within, Shen Wuyouluo carefully took out a jade slip. Engraved on the jade slip were clearly the first three seals of the Pure Spirit Seal⁸.

As the core profound art of the Evernight Divine Kingdom⁹, it was only natural that it would be hidden with such caution. But as Shen Wuyouluo subtly released profound energy, the jade slip was silently shattered. From the fragments, pieces of blood-stained scrolls drifted out. Shen Wuyouluo made a sweeping motion in the air with her palm, and these scroll fragments immediately pieced themselves together in an orderly fashion. In an instant, they formed a tattered, seventy-percent blood-stained, yet every word clear, large red paper scroll. Especially the opening words "Marriage Contract," which were so clearly reflected in Shen Wuyi's eyes that her previously blurry vision became clear. No one knew what immense risk Shen Wuyouluo had taken to conceal this marriage contract... because she knew it was the only proof for Shen Wuyi to reclaim her past. Shen Wuyi's unfocused beautiful eyes overflowed with an indescribable strange light. The words on it instantly imprinted themselves into her mind... matching Yun Che's recitation in the Forbidden Zone word for word.

At the end of the marriage contract, she saw the names "Xiao Che" and "Xia Qingyue," and beneath their birth dates, two complete and deep finger imprints. Her slightly trembling fingers picked up the torn sleeve from Yun Che. The finger imprint on it perfectly overlapped with the imprint on the marriage contract, even in her clearly blurry vision. Also overlapping was the finger ring on her right finger with the delicate finger imprint beneath the name Xia Qingyue. Her moon-like eyes trembled violently, and her fingers unconsciously curled.

That was... my past... So, I wasn't someone without a past... So, I wasn't a rootless duckweed... Xia Qingyue... that was my former name... my true name... Cangfeng Liuyun¹⁰... a surname that doesn't exist in this world, a birthplace that doesn't exist in this world... Yun Che... Xiao Che... homeland... So I... "Aunt..."

She closed her eyes, her voice a faint murmur like a dream: "Erase... the traces..."

Her hand fell limply, and her consciousness finally sank into complete silence. Shen Wuyouluo gently laid Shen Wuyi down, then quickly put away the marriage contract and the torn sleeve, concealing them within the Abyssal Crystal's aura. Her mind, however, was in a turmoil that refused to settle for a long time. Back then, when she found Shen Wuyi in the Mist Sea, she had determined from the marriage contract she carried that she was not of this world, and very likely from the Eternal Pure Land. Because there was no "Cangfeng Liuyun" in this world, nor the surname "Xia." But she knew that if this secret were revealed, Shen Wuyi's fate would no longer be free. Out of pity, she hid it on herself, hoping to return it to her after she recovered... but she never expected that Shen Wuyan Ye¹¹ would discover her Nine Profound Exquisite Body¹², forcing her to become the Evernight Divine Maiden. In Shen Wuyouluo's view, becoming the Evernight Divine Maiden was far more tragic than having the secret of her origin from the Eternal Pure Land revealed. Therefore, she had always carried an unspeakable guilt towards Shen Wuyi.

She never expected that this secret would be suddenly revealed by Shen Wuyi herself, so unexpectedly. She could not foresee what kind of ultimate outcome this sudden turn of fate would lead to. But no matter what, the Evernight Divine Kingdom could no longer be darker than it was now.

Yun Che had been self-healing for a long time, and his injuries and profound energy had largely recovered. Although he had deliberately prolonged the time, in Hua Caili's¹³ eyes, it was still astonishingly fast.

"As expected of light profound energy. It feels even more powerful than before."

She leaned against Yun Che's shoulder, smiling sweetly. "Auntie even reminded me earlier that people who can cultivate light profound energy are especially pure and kind-hearted, and told me not to bully you just because you spoil me. It feels like Auntie is almost kinder to you than she is to me... hee hee."

Her words, though seemingly tinged with jealousy, were full of pure joy.

Yun Che smiled slightly. "All of Auntie's kindness to me is because of you, and even more so, for you."

He stood up and stretched his upper body. "Alright, we should head back now."

"Okay!"

Hua Caili put away her Liyun Sword¹⁴ and mused, "This Divine Slumber Forbidden Zone was described as so mysterious and unpredictable. I thought it would be a place with many strange things and special opportunities, but it looks just like the Mist Sea, only with more Abyssal Ghosts¹⁵."

Yun Che said, "Since it's a place where gods fell, there should indeed have been many divine relics in the past. But, this place belongs to the Pure Land after all, so any divine relics that originally existed must have been almost entirely retrieved during the Pure Land's countless searches. Otherwise, why would it be so generously opened to the Divine Kingdom?"

Hua Caili nodded in agreement. "Exactly. I wonder why that hateful Shen Wuyi would want such a strange reward."

Speaking of which, she suddenly remembered... it seemed the Abyssal Emperor still owed her a favor. Yun Che's palm grabbed, and the Void-Breaking Divine Jade¹⁶ he had previously thrown away was drawn back into his fingers.

Hua Caili's eyes immediately showed confusion, and she blurted out, "Brother Yun, when you were in danger earlier, why didn't you immediately use the Void-Breaking Divine Jade to escape? Did that Shen Wuyi ambush you when you weren't prepared?"

Yun Che opened his lips, as if to answer, but then suddenly thought of something, and his expression drastically changed: "Oh no!"

He suddenly turned and rapidly flew back into the Abyssal Mist behind them.

"Eh? Brother Yun!!" Hua Caili cried out in surprise, quickly following. But Yun Che's speed did not slow down at all, only the aura around him became increasingly anxious and agitated. After a while, Yun Che finally stopped.

Ahead, the Abyssal Mist permeated, so thick it was suffocating. A dark abyssal maw gaped open on the ground, releasing a terrifying aura that made one's soul tremble.

"This is... the Dead Abyss¹⁷?" Hua Caili stood beside Yun Che, murmuring in surprise. This was also her first time witnessing the legendary Dead Abyss, said to only exist deep within the Mist Sea. Yun Che extended his hand, palm facing the Dead Abyss, profound energy and soul aura continuously surging, gradually tinged with a hint of panic and agitation.

"Brother Yun, what exactly happened?" Hua Caili asked worriedly.

Yun Che slowly clenched his five fingers, let out a long breath, his voice somewhat strained: "I was previously besieged by several Abyssal Ghosts, and the Yunli Sword¹⁸ accidentally fell into it..."

"Ah?!?"

Hua Caili gasped in alarm, finally understanding why he was so panicked.

"The Yunli Sword is connected to my soul aura, but now, I can't sense its existence at all."

Yun Che's voice seemed to be trying to remain calm, but an uncontrollable sense of loss still leaked out. "Even when I was in danger earlier, I didn't choose to escape immediately because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find the Yunli Sword again. But... it seems..."

"..." Hua Caili parted her lips, unsure how to comfort him, only able to press her body closer to his. Once something falls into the Dead Abyss, all things return to nothingness. This understanding accompanied all records concerning the Dead Abyss.

Yun Che took a slight breath, withdrew his hand, then seemed to laugh with relief, comforting Hua Caili in turn: "It's come to this... It's alright. Master often says, 'To gain is luck, to lose is fate.' He certainly won't blame me."

"Mm!"

"...Let's go."

Two Void-Breaking Divine Jades shattered simultaneously, taking Yun Che and Hua Caili out of the Divine Slumber Forbidden Zone. The moment their figures disappeared, a faint, ancient demonic roar seemed to emanate from the previously silent Dead Abyss, vanishing into the dim Abyssal Mist in an instant.

"That is our homeland, not their Eternal Pure Land!!"

"Once the people of the Abyss step foot there, all living beings in the homeland will become lambs to the slaughter..."

"You see yourself as selfish and cold-hearted because your body and soul are repelling this world!"

"You are Xia Qingyue..."

"You are the Empress of the Eternal Pure Land..."

"I need your help..."

"No matter what... you must... stop..."

"..."

Shen Wuyi suddenly woke up and sat upright, instant severe pain sweeping through her entire body, but she bit her jade teeth tightly, not letting out a single whimper. The surroundings were quiet, no one was by her side, only the healing profound formation silently operating.

Since that is the case... the last page of the [Secret Tome] must be revealed early... Then... Shen Wuyan Ye! I allow you to... repay... your debt... early!

As soon as Yun Che and Hua Caili stepped out of the Void-Breaking Formation, Meng Jianxi¹⁹ instantly greeted them. After carefully examining Yun Che, she let out a sigh of relief: "It seems you encountered a fierce battle, but thankfully, you're not seriously injured."

Yun Che was slightly startled, then realized something, and gave Meng Jianxi a faint smile, everything understood without words.

Hua Caili, however, immediately saw Dugu Zhuyuan²⁰ waiting there, and exclaimed in surprise, "Uncle Dugu, shouldn't you and Auntie be fighting in Abyssal Heaven²¹? I remember the shortest battle before lasted three days. This time... it couldn't have already ended, could it??"

Dugu Zhuyuan suddenly let out a sigh of unknown meaning, his eyes also complex and hard to describe.

This reaction piqued Yun Che's interest. He seemingly casually said, "Could it be that Auntie... Senior Sword Immortal²² was delayed by something?"

Dugu Zhuyuan glanced at them, hesitated for a moment, then said, "This time, it was my last battle with Sword Immortal. From now on, there's no need to fight anymore."

"Eh?"

Hua Caili was full of confusion. "Why?"

Dugu Zhuyuan, however, shook his head, not elaborating. "Abyssal Divine Son²³ is injured, go rest early."

Although Hua Caili was full of questions, she didn't press further and left with Yun Che.

After they had gone far, Dugu Zhuyuan let out a long sigh, his lips murmuring somewhat distractedly, "So, her title of Sword Immortal was not because she could only be a Sword Immortal, but because she only wished to be a Sword Immortal."

"Forcefully holding onto mortal thoughts, just for Caili... My life is already destined to be incomparable, unreachable."
