Yun Che collapsed to the ground, his entire body smeared with blood like splashed ink. Crimson stains spread across the dim abyssal rocks, shocking to behold. Shen Wuyi stood before him, the Relentless Sword’s icy gleam pointed straight at his throat, its tip barely a hair’s breadth from his skin. Anyone who saw this scene would instantly assume that Shen Wuyi had gravely wounded Yun Che and now intended to take his life.

This scene entered Hua Caili’s eyes, and every string of her soul tightened to the point of snapping. Her beautiful eyes shattered into endless stars of rage, and the Liyun Sword in her hand shot forth, carrying an at-full-burst Heaven Breaker Sword Intent aimed straight at Shen Wuyi’s most fatal point. It was the first time in her life that Hua Caili released such a decisive, killing sword — without hesitation, without holding back. In its flight, the trembling Liyun Sword let out an almost ear-piercing hum born of her extreme fear and fury.

The sword light, shining with tragic brilliance, cut through the gray world like dawn breaking, and in an instant it was already behind Shen Wuyi… Yet Shen Wuyi seemed completely unaware — her body unmoving, her Exquisite Realm and Glazed Glass Ice not manifesting, and not even the slightest hint of energy released.

Chi— the sword pierced through her heart, passing through her body before even a spray of blood could appear. Yun Che’s pupils shrank at once. What the Liyun Sword pierced was not Shen Wuyi’s projection, but her actual body — undefended. At the moment it pierced her heart, the e Heaven Breaker Sword Intent exploded within her mercilessly, devastating her organs in an instant and shattering countless meridians. Yun Che had already sensed Hua Caili’s approach.

With Shen Wuyi’s cultivation at the sixth level of the Divine Annihilation Realm — far beyond the norm — and with her spiritual sense unaffected by the Abyssal Dust, she undoubtedly sensed it long before. But… why did she neither dodge nor defend?

Severely wounded, her blood and energy surged chaotically; Shen Wuyi’s face turned deathly pale, and blood poured uncontrollably from her lips. Yet her expression remained as cold and indifferent as before — showing no pain, no surprise.

After piercing through her, the Liyun Sword did not lose momentum. Just before touching Yun Che, it suddenly curved upward, tracing a beautiful sunset-like arc in the gray space before flying into the young woman’s jade-like fingers.

Hua Caili’s figure had already appeared in front of Yun Che. Her overflowing fury, in sword and energy, forced Shen Wuyi far back. She pointed her sword at Shen Wuyi, her voice trembling and hoarse:
“Shen Wuyi… you… how dare you…!”

Protected behind her, Yun Che could only barely see her profile — divine robes dust-stained, long hair slightly disheveled, the corners of her eyes dyed with a fiery, raging red. It was not her usual shy blush, but the scarlet hue born from searing wrath. The sword aura, once full of spiritual elegance, seemed to have been ignited entirely, turning into fine glimmering sword marks swirling around her. Even the strands of hair by her temples rose violently with the agitation of her power.

Even Hua Fuchen and Hua Qingying — who had watched Hua Caili grow up her entire life — had never seen her look so frightening.

But even in such overwhelming rage, she still did not lose control. She held her sword in one hand, while the other was placed behind her, tightly connected to Yun Che’s aura. In fact, more than half of her profound energy was gathered in the palm behind her. In her eyes, reflecting the figure of Shen Wuyi, there shone a bone-piercing coldness she had never shown in her life. The jade sword in her hand hummed and trembled, its radiant sword light nearly blinding. Even knowing she was no match for the opponent, she still released a resolve that would burn both jade and stone without the slightest retreat.

Shen Wuyi did not speak. She rose into the air and flew far away. At the moment her figure fully disappeared into the gray mist, her eyes turned, deeply locking onto Yun Che for a brief instant… and also touched Yun Che’s gaze, which had been firmly following her, filled with too many emotions and thoughts. Somehow, in that single instant of eye contact, she actually understood the deeper meaning hidden in his eyes.

Hua Caili’s body remained tense. Only after Shen Wuyi’s presence completely vanished from her senses did she seem to awaken from a nightmare, and the sword aura trembling around her collapsed in an instant.

Clang!

The most precious Liyun Sword slipped from her powerless fingers. She spun around sharply and dropped to her knees in front of Yun Che, her trembling voice hoarse:
“Brother Yun… are you… are you alright…? Where are you hurt…?”

Her previous fury and killing intent scattered without a trace, leaving only fear so intense it drained all color from her snowy face. In just that short sentence, her eyes were already filled with a shimmering mist of tears.

“Don’t worry, I’m fine.”
Yun Che’s lips curved into a faint smile, and at the same time, the light profound energy glowed warmly, soothing his injuries and calming the girl’s completely panicked soul.

Feeling the still-full profound energy and the life force within Yun Che’s body, Hua Caili finally let out a long breath. She grasped the corner of his clothing, briefly overwhelmed by exhaustion after the intense shock.

Only then did she notice that the wounds on Yun Che’s body were clearly inflicted by Abyssal Ghosts or Abyssal Beasts. The wounds still leaked the unique gray mist of abyssal corrosion — they were definitely not caused by the Merciless Sword or the God-Purifying Seal.
But she had clearly seen Shen Wuyi’s sword pointed at Yun Che’s throat. Had she arrived even a moment later, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

“Shen Wuyi… why did she want to kill you?”
Hua Caili asked softly, staying alert to their surroundings.

Shen Wuyi’s figure had already been etched with a mark of resentment in her heart.
Now that she had calmed a little, confusion also surfaced… Why didn’t Shen Wuyi dodge? And with her level of cultivation, even without using that strange profound ice, the Liyun Sword shouldn’t have been able to pierce through her so easily…

Yun Che held her hand and said calmly:
“I have no enmity with Shen Wuyi. If she acted like that, it can only be because of Wu Ming God Emperor.”

“Ah!?”

Hearing a matter involving a national God Emperor, Hua Caili instinctively tightened her small hand.
“How could this be… why?”

“Heh…”

Yun Che let out a light laugh.
“The Wuming God Emperor’s actions—how could they ever follow common logic? You must have heard about her past. I guess that when she saw me endure double the Abyssal Devouring punishment alone atop Eden Cloud Peak, she was provoked. She couldn’t accept that a man in this world could go that far for a woman, so she developed the intent to kill… cough, cough.”

Hua Caili hurriedly reached out to lightly touch his chest, her eyes filled with heartache. She then said angrily:
“She herself just met the wrong person, and was hurt by that man called… I think it was Shen Wuxueyan. And because of that, she wants to deny everyone else? That’s truly awful! No wonder even Father God says she’s an unreasonable lunatic.”

“Brother Yun, let’s leave here first. I’m afraid that if… Shen Wuyi comes back again…”

“Don’t worry.”

Yun Che showed no sign of concern.
“When we ran into each other, she had clearly just gone through a fierce battle. Her profound energy was extremely unstable, and then she was pierced through the heart by your sword. Her injuries must be far worse than mine. She’s barely able to take care of herself—there’s no way she still has the strength to come kill me.”

“And besides, going out like this would truly be… far too disgraceful.”

“I see… so that’s how it is…”

Hearing that, Hua Caili murmured softly, seeming somewhat enlightened.

But with Yun Che in front of her, how could she distract herself by thinking too deeply?
“Alright, focus on healing first. Once we get out, we must immediately tell Father God and Uncle Meng.”

“Mm.”

Yun Che replied softly:
“But after telling your father, you should also persuade him not to get angry. The Wuming God Emperor was acting out of momentary rage, and it will soon fade. Unless there is absolutely no other choice, one should not confront a madwoman head-on… Besides, all my injuries were caused by Abyssal Ghosts. Shen Wuyi didn’t even have time to attack me.”

Hua Caili thought for a moment, then finally agreed obediently:
“I understand. Brother Yun, you’re always so kind. Even though you were almost hit by such a terrifying scheme, you’re still thinking about Father God and the others.”

Yun Che silently looked at her, then suddenly tightened his grip and pulled her into his chest.

“Ah…”
Hua Caili let out a soft cry. Worried about his injuries, she didn’t dare struggle even a little. She simply leaned obediently against him, allowing his blood to dye her pure white divine robe. A faint scent of blood and his unique, cool breath lingered at her nose.

“Caili,”

Beside the girl’s ear came his soft whisper—half serious, half teasing:
“If one day, I were to do something like what Shen Wuxueyan did to her… would you become another Shen Wuyanye?”

“Pft!”

Hua Caili instantly burst into laughter, her delicate body trembling lightly.
She gently rested her pretty forehead against Yun Che’s chest, listening to the slightly unsteady rhythm of his heartbeat. After seriously thinking through the things rumored about what Shen Wuxueyan had done, she finally said softly:

“In this world, only I know how good Brother Yun truly is. So, if one day you end up liking another woman the way Shen Wuxueyan did, and even marry her as your Divine Consort… that would only mean one thing: that I didn’t do well enough. At the very least, I wasn’t as good as that woman, which is why Brother Yun’s eyes and heart shifted to someone else.”

Yun Che: “…”

“I would never become someone as frightening as Shen Wuyanye. Otherwise, Brother Yun would definitely stop liking me completely. I would… I would fix my flaws, and then cling to you every single day, so you’d never have time to pay attention to anyone else. Heehee.”

Yun Che lifted his head, looking at the dim sky above, and said:

“Then… if I were to do something a hundred times worse than what Shen Wuxueyan did, would you hate me?”

Hua Caili’s answer came faster and more direct than Yun Che expected.

“Of… course… not! I told you already—so long as it’s Brother Yun, no matter what you do, I will forgive you.”

She raised her head, suddenly reached out, and pinched both sides of Yun Che’s lips, smiling sweetly:

“Brother Yun’s kindness to me—I know it better than anyone. As for Brother Yun’s badness… the most excessive thing you could do to me would just be… would just be…”

Her voice gradually softened, her beautiful eyes shyly turning away, her cheeks tinting with a faint blush:

“I get it! It must be that during these three years, you thought of more strange things again… and since Father God and Aunt aren’t here… you’re taking advantage of being so injured and still thinking of bullying me…”

“Uh… you were the one who—”

“No! Saying that is not allowed!!”

She applied a little force, pulling Yun Che’s lips into a flat line, stopping the words he was about to say.

In the past, with her childlike innocence, she would never notice anything, taking all straightforward words as jokes.

————

At the edge of the Pure Land, the Void-Breaking Array suddenly shone with a flash of gray light.
A woman’s figure slowly stepped out, dragging behind her a trail of shocking blood.

At this time, less than twenty-four hours had passed since they had entered the God-Slumber Forbidden Region.

Pan Buzhuo had already escaped during the sixth hour, shouting that inside there was nothing but Abyssal Dust and danger, with no so-called divine inheritance to be found—mocking that the Eternal Night Goddess was ignorant and foolish, wasting such an enormous opportunity.

And now, the second to exit… was none other than Shen Wuyi—the very person responsible for this opening of the God-Slumber Forbidden Region.

But the severity of her injuries made everyone who saw her draw a sharp breath.

“Wuyi!!”
Shen Wuyouluan, who had been guarding the area the whole time, cried out in shock. She rushed forward and caught Shen Wuyi, who was clearly gravely injured and on the verge of collapse.

As the familiar warmth approached, Shen Wuyi—who had been forcefully holding herself together for so long—finally loosened her taut heartstrings and collapsed weakly into Shen Wuyouluan’s arms. Yet she stubbornly refused to let herself fall unconscious. In a frail voice, she murmured:

“Aunt… take me… to see Mother Goddess…”

“Alright… calm your breath, don’t speak anymore.”
Shen Wuyouluan’s voice trembled slightly from heartache. She cradled Shen Wuyi and draped a fresh black robe over her… concealing the wound at her chest. With a single glance, she recognized it as a sword wound left by the e Heaven Breaker Sword Intent.

Pure Land — within the barrier forged personally by the Wu Ming Divine Sovereign, the domain of the Eternal Night Divine Nation.

Shen Wuyi’s face was completely drained of color. Her entire body was covered in the claw marks of Abyssal Ghosts—several of them dangerously close to fatal. But the most horrifying of all was the sword wound at her chest. The terrifying e Heaven Breaker Sword Intent still lingered inside, not yet dissipated. In her current condition, she had no ability to expel it. Had she been found even half an hour later, she would undoubtedly have died.

Shen Wuyouluan carefully dispersed the remnants of the e Heaven Breaker Sword Intent from her body. Shen Wuyi could no longer stand, yet still had to face Shen Wuyanye’s terrifying wrath.

“You’re saying that not only did you fail to kill Yun Che, but you were discovered by the e Heaven Breaker Goddess, and even injured to such a miserable state by her?”

Shen Wuyanye’s voice was sharp enough to pierce the ear, each word filled with fury. All the Eternal Night maidens around them lowered their heads deeply, not even daring to meet the sound of her voice.

“Re… reporting… Mother Goddess…”
Her breath was as faint as a dying flame, yet she still summoned every shred of willpower to avoid fainting.

“The Forbidden Region… countless Abyssal Ghosts… Wuyi fought for long… when I encountered Yun Che… I was already gravely wounded and exhausted…”

“When I struck… my consciousness blurred from the injuries… and the Abyssal Dust’s soul-binding… I failed to sense the e Heaven Breaker Goddess… cough… cough cough…”

“Wuyi! Wuyi… don’t speak anymore!”

Shen Wuyouluan pressed her hand urgently against Wuyi’s chest. Her fingers turned pale from the pain in her heart. Facing the pitch-black palanquin, she pleaded:

“Your Excellency, if Wuyi had not been gravely injured at that moment, with her cultivation and the Linglong Profound Realm, she never would have been harmed by the e Heaven Breaker Goddess. No matter how many mistakes Wuyi may have made, at least… at least allow her to heal first. In her current state, she truly cannot withstand Your Excellency’s wrath.”

Shen Wuyouluan’s plea could not bring even the slightest trace of mercy from Shen Wuyanye.
From within the palanquin came a voice filled with a soul-tearing chill:

“Acting on your own and going to that so-called Divine Slumber Forbidden Domain… defiant, foolish, useless! And you still dare try to excuse yourself with excuses!”

At that moment, Shen Wuyi slowly raised her hand, the movement incomparably weak.
As her deathly pale fingers opened, resting quietly in her palm was a strange gray Abyssal Crystal, around which lingered a faint yet peculiar aura.

“Did not… disgrace… the mission…”
With those soft words, her consciousness finally failed her.
She fainted in Shen Wuyouluan’s arms, and the crystal slipped powerlessly from her hand.

Shen Wuyouluan instinctively grabbed it, stared at it briefly—then suddenly cried out in shock:

“This is… the Abyssheart Vine?!?”

“Your Excellency, it’s the Abyssheart Vine! It’s the Abyssheart Vine!!”

The icy fury from within the palanquin abruptly froze, followed by a surge of chaotic, trembling profound energy.

Shen Wumingque rushed forward, snatching the crystal from Shen Wuyouluan’s hand.
He then let out the same excited shout:

“Nearly an inch long, shaped like a withered vine… its aura sometimes like scorching fire, sometimes like coiling lightning… its core trembles like a mortal’s beating heart…
It matches perfectly—the ‘Abyssheart Vine’ described in the secret records!”

“Your Excellency, it truly is the Abyssheart Vine! Wuyi really found it!”

Whoosh!!!

A sudden cold wind rose, and the Abyssheart Vine in Shen Wumingque’s hand was sucked into the palanquin…
Immediately, the aura around the palanquin trembled even more violently, continuing without end.

Shen Wuyouluan dropped heavily to her knees and said sorrowfully:

“Your Excellency, in order to search for the Abyssheart Vine, we have sent countless people into and out of the Mist Sea over these years, sparing no effort, yet we gained nothing.”

“Wuyi used the Abyss Emperor’s granted permission to enter the Divine Slumber Forbidden Domain for that tiny sliver of hope…
For her to actually find the Abyssheart Vine means that from the moment she entered the domain, she must have risked everything to hunt Abyssal Ghosts.
She must have ignored all her injuries, terrified of wasting even a single breath or even a single instant of hope.”

“I cannot imagine how many Abyssal Ghosts she had to hunt to end up this severely wounded.
And even in such a state, when she encountered Yun Che, she still did not forget Your Excellency’s command.
Only then… only then…”

“I beg Your Excellency, for the sake of Wuyi’s devotion—so pure that even the heavens were moved enough to grant her the Abyssheart Vine—please do not punish her any further.”

The atmosphere froze briefly.
Then Shen Wuyanye’s voice rang out—hoarser and harsher than usual:

“Why are you still here! Take Wuyi down for treatment immediately!!”

“Yes!”
As if hearing a divine decree, Shen Wuyouluan quickly picked up Shen Wuyi and hurried away with careful steps.
