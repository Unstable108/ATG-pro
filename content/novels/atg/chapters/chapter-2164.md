Yun Che collapsed to the ground, his body covered in bloodstains as if splattered with ink, the crimson spreading across the dark Abyss Stone¹, a horrifying sight. Shen Wuyi² stood before him, her Absolute Love Sword³ pointing coldly at his throat, the tip barely a hair's breadth from his skin. Anyone seeing this scene would instantly conclude that Shen Wuyi had gravely wounded Yun Che and intended to take his life.

This sight burned into Hua Caili's⁴ eyes, her soul strings instantly tensed, threatening to snap. Her beautiful eyes shattered into countless furious starlight, and her Li Cloud Sword⁵ shot out, carrying the Heaven-Folding Sword Intent⁶ that had erupted to its peak in an instant, aiming directly for Shen Wuyi's most vulnerable fatal spot. This was the first time in her life that Hua Caili had unleashed a death-dealing sword with such resolve, without hesitation, without reservation. The flying Li Cloud Sword hummed with an almost piercing tremor amidst her extreme panic and rage.

The dazzling, desolate sword light, like the dawn breaking, split the dim world in two, and in a flash, it was behind Shen Wuyi... But Shen Wuyi seemed utterly unaware, her body unmoving, neither her Exquisite Profound Realm⁷ nor her Profound Ice of Glaze⁸ appearing, not even a trace of profound energy⁹ released. Ch— The sharp sword pierced through her heart, passing clean through her body before even a speck of blood could splash. Yun Che's pupils instantly constricted. The Li Cloud Sword had not pierced a phantom of Shen Wuyi, but her physical body, utterly devoid of any defense. The moment it passed through her heart, the Heaven-Folding Sword Intent mercilessly erupted within her body, instantly gravely wounding her internal organs and shattering countless meridians.

Yun Che had long since sensed Hua Caili's approach. Shen Wuyi, with her cultivation at the sixth level of the Divine Annihilation Realm¹⁰, coupled with her spiritual perception that far surpassed common sense and was unaffected by Abyss Dust¹¹, had undoubtedly also sensed it long ago. But... why did she not evade or defend herself?

Severely wounded, her blood and profound energy surged in reverse, Shen Wuyi's face instantly turned ashen, and a large stream of blood she couldn't suppress spilled from her lips. Yet, her expression remained as cold and indifferent as before, showing no hint of pain or surprise. The Li Cloud Sword, having passed through her body, did not diminish its momentum. Just as it was about to touch Yun Che, it suddenly arced upwards, drawing a beautiful, rainbow-like curve in the dim space, then flew into the maiden's jade-like fingers.

Hua Caili's figure now stood before Yun Che, her furious sword intent and profound energy forcing Shen Wuyi far back. She pointed her sword at Shen Wuyi, her voice trembling and hoarse: "Shen Wuyi, you... how dare you..."

Yun Che, protected behind her, could only barely see her profile... Her divine garment¹² was stained with dust, her long hair slightly disheveled, and the corners of her eyes were tinged with a vibrant red from extreme fury. That was by no means her usual delicate rouge color, but the crimson cloud¹³ color scorched by rage. The sword qi, originally imbued with endless spiritual charm, also seemed to be ignited by the flames of anger, transforming into fragmented sword marks circulating around her body. Even the strands of hair falling by her temples bristled with the agitation of her profound energy. Even Hua Fuchen and Hua Qingying, who had watched Hua Caili grow up her entire life, had never seen her look so terrifying.

But even in such extreme rage, she did not lose her mind and lash out. She held her sword in one hand, while the other was placed behind her, tightly connected to Yun Che's aura. Even most of her profound energy was concentrated in the hand behind her. Her eyes reflected Shen Wuyi's figure, refracting an icy chill she had never felt in her life. The jade sword in her hand hummed and trembled, its bright sword light almost blinding. Knowing she was no match for her opponent, she nonetheless unleashed a desperate resolve to perish together like jade and common stone.

Shen Wuyi said nothing, soaring into the air and flying far away. The moment her figure completely disappeared into the gray mist, her eyes turned, gazing deeply at Yun Che. Her gaze met Yun Che's, which had been tightly following her, imbued with so much emotion and longing. Inexplicably, in that fleeting moment of eye contact, she understood the profound meaning hidden in his gaze.

Hua Caili remained tense until Shen Wuyi's aura completely vanished from her perception. Only then did she seem to awaken from a nightmare, her trembling sword qi instantly dissipating. Clang!

Her most cherished Li Cloud Sword slipped from her fingers, powerless. She spun around abruptly and knelt before Yun Che, trembling: "Brother Yun, you... are you alright... where are you hurt..."

Her earlier rage and killing intent had vanished without a trace, leaving only fear that drained all color from her fair face. In just a few short words, her eyes were already welling up with layers of mist.

"Don't worry, I'm fine." Yun Che's lips curved into a smile, and his light profound strength¹⁴ shone warmly at this moment, soothing his injuries and calming the maiden's utterly distraught soul. Sensing the still relatively abundant profound energy and life aura in Yun Che's body, Hua Caili finally let out a long sigh of relief. She clutched Yun Che's clothes, experiencing a brief moment of exhaustion from the intense lingering fear.

It was then that she noticed Yun Che's injuries were clearly inflicted by Abyss Devils¹⁵ or Abyss Beasts¹⁶. The wounds still exuded the unique gray mist of Abyss Corrosion¹⁷, definitely not the wounds left by the Absolute Love Sword or the Nether God Seal¹⁸. However, she had clearly seen Shen Wuyi pointing her sword at Yun Che's throat. If she had arrived even a moment later, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

"Shen Wuyi... why did she want to kill you?" Hua Caili cautiously guarded their surroundings, asking softly.

Shen Wuyi's figure was quietly marked with resentment in her heart. Now that she had calmed down slightly, a question immediately arose in her mind... Why hadn't she dodged earlier? And with her cultivation, even without using that strange profound ice, the Li Cloud Sword shouldn't have pierced her heart so easily...

Yun Che took her hand, his tone calm: "Shen Wuyi and I have no grievances. Her actions can only be because of Wuming Divine Sovereign¹⁹."

"Ah!?"

Involving a Divine Sovereign of a nation, Hua Caili's hand instinctively tightened: "How could that be... why?"

"Heh..." Yun Che chuckled softly: "How could Wuming Divine Sovereign's actions ever conform to common sense? You must have heard of her past. I guess she was stimulated by witnessing me alone enduring the double Desolation Devourment²⁰ punishment at Eden Cloud Summit²¹, unwilling to accept that there could be a man in this world who would go to such lengths for a woman, thus giving rise to a murderous intent... cough, cough."

Hua Caili quickly reached out and gently touched his chest, her eyes filled with heartache, then indignantly said: "She herself had bad luck with men, hurt by that person called... I think Shen Wuxueyan²²... and now she wants to deny everyone. She's truly hateful! No wonder even Father God says she's an utterly unreasonable madwoman."

"Brother Yun, let's leave this place first. I'm afraid that... Shen Wuyi might come back."

"No need to worry." Yun Che, however, showed no concern: "When he and she met, she had clearly just gone through a fierce battle, her profound energy was extremely unstable, and then you pierced her heart with a sword. Her injuries must be far more severe than mine now. She's too preoccupied with her own injuries to have any spare energy to come kill me."

"Besides, going out in this state would truly be... too disheveled and pathetic."

"So... that's how it is..." Hua Caili murmured softly, seeming to understand somewhat.

But with Yun Che in front of her, how could she be distracted by deep thought: "Okay, you focus on healing your injuries first. After we get out, we must immediately tell Father God and Uncle Meng."

"Mm." Yun Che lightly responded: "However, after telling your Father God, you must also persuade him not to get angry. Wuming Divine Sovereign's anger is but temporary and will soon dissipate. Unless absolutely necessary, one should not openly contend with a madwoman... Moreover, all my injuries were caused by Abyss Devils; Shen Wuyi didn't even get a chance to lay a hand on me."

Hua Caili thought for a moment, then finally agreed obediently: "I know. Brother Yun, you are always so kind. Even though you almost suffered such a terrible ambush, you still think of Father God and the others."

Yun Che silently looked at her, then suddenly exerted force on his hand, pulling her towards his chest.

"Ah..." Hua Caili let out a soft gasp. Mindful of his injuries, she dared not struggle even slightly, and thus obediently nestled into his embrace, allowing his bloodstains to dye her pure white divine garment. A faint scent of blood mingled with his unique clean aura lingered at her nose.

"Caili," his soft murmur, seemingly serious yet teasing, reached the maiden's ear: "If one day, I were to do something like Shen Wuxueyan did to you, would you become another Shen Wuyanye²³?"

"Pfft!" Hua Caili immediately burst out laughing, her body trembling slightly. She gently leaned her head against Yun Che's chest, listening to his slightly erratic heartbeat. After seriously pondering the rumored deeds of Shen Wuxueyan, she softly said: "In this world, only I know how good Brother Yun is. So, if one day, you were to fall in love with another woman like Shen Wuxueyan did, and even marry another woman to be your Divine Child Consort²⁴, that would only mean that I must not have been good enough, or at least not as good as that woman, which would cause Brother Yun's gaze and heart to shift to someone else."

Yun Che: "..."

"I would never become someone as terrifying as Shen Wuyanye. Otherwise, Brother Yun would definitely stop liking me completely. I would... I would change my shortcomings, and then pester you every day, leaving you no time to pay attention to anyone else, hehe."

Yun Che looked up at the dim sky and then said: "What if I did something a hundred times worse than Shen Wuxueyan? Would you hate me?"

Hua Caili's response was far quicker and more direct than Yun Che had anticipated.

"Of... course... not! I told you, as long as it's Brother Yun, no matter what you do, I will forgive you."

She lifted her head, then suddenly reached out and gently pinched the corners of Yun Che's lips, smiling: "I know better than anyone how good Brother Yun is to me; as for Brother Yun's bad side... the worst thing you could do to me is... is..."

Her voice gradually softened, and her beautiful eyes shyly darted away, her cheeks flushing with a faint pink glow: "I know! It must be that in these past three years, you've thought of some strange... and then, taking advantage of Father God and Auntie not being around... even though you're so badly injured, you're still thinking of bullying me..."

"Uh... you clearly are the one who..."

"Don't say it!!" She exerted a slight force on his lips, pulling them into a flat shape, stopping his subsequent words. Her innocent heart, unaware, spoke her true feelings as if they were jokes.

At the edge of the Pure Land²⁵, the Void-Breaking Grand Formation²⁶ suddenly glowed with gray light, and a female figure slowly emerged, dragging shocking bloodstains behind her.

At this time, less than twenty-four hours had passed since they entered the Divine Slumber Forbidden Zone²⁷. Pan Buzhuo²⁸ had already exited in the sixth hour, roaring that there was only Abyss Dust and danger within, with no divine legacy or opportunities to speak of, and even subtly mocking the Evernight Divine Maiden²⁹ for her ignorant and foolish actions, wasting a great opportunity. And this second person to emerge was none other than Shen Wuyi, who had caused the opening of the Divine Slumber Forbidden Zone. However, the severity of her injuries made everyone who saw her gasp in cold air.

"Wuyi!!" Shen Wuyouluan³⁰, who had been guarding there, exclaimed, quickly rushing forward to embrace Shen Wuyi, who was clearly severely injured and exhausted.

The familiar warm aura approached, and Shen Wuyi, who had been holding on for so long, finally felt her heartstrings relax and collapsed powerlessly into Shen Wuyouluan's arms. But she stubbornly refused to fall unconscious, uttering in a weak voice: "Auntie... take me... to see Mother Goddess..."

"Okay... quickly calm your mind and regulate your breathing, don't speak anymore." Shen Wuyouluan's voice trembled with heartache. She held Shen Wuyi, and a new black robe covered her... concealing the wound on her chest. She recognized at a glance that it was a sword wound left by the Heaven-Folding Sword Intent.

In the Pure Land, within the courtyard where the Evernight Divine Kingdom³¹ was located, inside the isolating barrier cast by Wuming Divine Sovereign.

Shen Wuyi's face was utterly bloodless, her body covered in claw marks from Abyss Devils, several of which were perilously close to being fatal. The most shocking, however, was the sword mark on her chest; the terrifying Heaven-Folding Sword Intent still lingered, and in her current state, she was utterly unable to dispel it. If it had been even half an hour later, she would surely have died. Shen Wuyouluan meticulously dispelled the Heaven-Folding Sword Intent from her body. Shen Wuyi, in her arms, was unable to stand, yet still had to face Shen Wuyanye's terrifying wrath.

"You mean, not only did you fail to kill Yun Che, but you were also discovered by the Heaven-Folding Divine Maiden³², and were injured to such a tragic state by her?"

Shen Wuyanye's harsh words were filled with anger, and all the Evernight Maidens around them bowed their heads deeply, seemingly not daring to even look at her voice.

"Reporting... Mother Goddess..." She was barely breathing, yet she poured all her will into not falling unconscious: "The Forbidden Zone... countless Abyss Devils... Wuyi fought for a long time... when she encountered Yun Che... she was already severely injured and exhausted..."

"When she made her move... due to her severe injuries... her consciousness was muddled... and with Abyss Dust binding her soul... she failed to notice the Heaven-Folding Divine Maiden... cough... cough, cough..."

"Wuyi! Wuyi... don't speak anymore!" Shen Wuyouluan quickly pressed her hand to Shen Wuyi's chest, her fingers turning white with heartache. She faced the dark palanquin³³, pleading: "Your Excellency³⁴, if Wuyi hadn't been so severely injured at the time, with her cultivation and Exquisite Profound Realm, how could she have been wounded by the Heaven-Folding Divine Maiden? Even if Wuyi made a thousand mistakes, at least... at least let her heal first. Her current state truly cannot withstand Your Excellency's wrath."

Shen Wuyouluan's plea, however, failed to elicit any pity from Shen Wuyanye. The voice from within the palanquin was a chilling, almost soul-splitting coldness: "Taking matters into your own hands to go to that so-called Divine Slumber Forbidden Zone, disobedient, foolish, useless! And you even try to make excuses!"

Shen Wuyi slowly raised her hand at this moment, her movements incredibly weak. As her pale fingers opened, a strange gray Abyss Crystal³⁵ lay quietly in her palm, faintly emanating a weak but peculiar aura.

"Fortunately... I did not... fail my mission..." As her soft words fell, her consciousness finally could no longer hold on, and she fainted in Shen Wuyouluan's arms, the Abyss Crystal in her hand slipping from her grasp.

Shen Wuyouluan instinctively snatched it, staring at it briefly, then suddenly cried out in excited surprise: "This is... Abyss Heart Vine³⁶!?"

"Your Excellency, it's the Abyss Heart Vine! It's the Abyss Heart Vine!!" The chilling anger from within the palanquin abruptly froze, followed by a somewhat chaotic surge of profound energy.

Shen Mingque³⁷ rushed forward, took the Abyss Crystal from Shen Wuyouluan's hand, and then let out an equally excited cry of surprise: "Nearly a full inch long, resembling a withered vine, its aura sometimes like scorching fire, sometimes like entwining lightning, and its core pulsed like the heart of a mortal spirit! It's exactly like the 'Abyss Heart Vine' in the secret... in the records!"

"Your Excellency, it's the Abyss Heart Vine! Wuyi truly found the Abyss Heart Vine!" Whoosh!!! A cold wind suddenly rose, and the Abyss Heart Vine in Shen Mingque's hand was swept into the palanquin... Following this, the aura around the palanquin trembled even more violently, lingering for a long time.

Shen Wuyouluan knelt heavily on the ground, saying sorrowfully: "Your Excellency, in order to search for the Abyss Heart Vine, countless people have entered and exited the Mist Sea³⁸ countless times, sparing no effort, but after all these years, we found nothing."

"Wuyi entered the Divine Slumber Forbidden Zone, risking even the Abyss Emperor's gracious permission³⁹, all for this sliver of hope... That she could find this Abyss Heart Vine shows that the moment she entered the Forbidden Zone, she spared no effort in hunting Abyss Devils, probably even disregarding her injuries, fearing to waste even a moment of hope."

"One can't even imagine how many Abyss Devils she must have hunted to be injured to this extent. And even with such severe injuries, when she encountered Yun Che, she did not forget Your Excellency's command, which is why... which is why..."

"I beg Your Excellency, please consider Wuyi's sincere heart⁴⁰, which even Heaven was moved by and bestowed the Abyss Heart Vine, and do not punish her further."

The atmosphere briefly froze, followed by Shen Wuyanye's voice, even hoarser than usual: "What are you still doing here! Take Wuyi down to heal immediately!!"

"Yes!" Shen Wuyouluan heard it like a heavenly decree⁴¹, quickly picked up Shen Wuyi, and retreated with hurried and careful steps.
