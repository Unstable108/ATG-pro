The next few days, Hua Caili was unable to meet Hua Fuchen. It was clear that he was avoiding her.

Luckily, Hua Fuchen had not given the order to expel Yun Che either.

When she asked Hua Qingying about this, the response she received was, “Your Father needs time.”

Hua Qingying then added some severity into her voice, “You best practice some self-restraint. Do you think I don’t know what you’re thinking? You’re hoping to get yourself pregnant so you have additional chips to pressure your Father.”

“Huh? Hehehe… as I thought, I can’t hide anything from you, aunt. Aaaaanyway… I’ll be taking my leave, aunt. Don’t spy on us!”

“...” Hua Qingying could only sigh helplessly.

Finally, on the seventh day, Hua Caili saw her Father in the Yixin Sword Pavilion.

“Father!” She cried out eagerly and ran over to him immediately, a million flatteries and gestures primed to fire at a moment’s notice.

“Sit.” Hua Fuchen declared with a dignified expression while glancing at the seat next to him.

Hua Caili obeyed and took her seat. Then, she asked carefully and meekly, “Are you… still angry with me, Father?”

Hua Fuchen harrumphed. “You ignored everyone and went nowhere for the past week, clinging to that kid and only that kid all day and night. A blind person could tell that you’re pressuring me. If I was angry… I would’ve died from anger already.”

“Hehe.” Hua Caili giggled cutely and flatteringly. “What can I do? I just can’t leave big brother Yun’s side.”

She jumped off her chair and knelt beside Hua Fuchen, delicate hands shaking his knees left and right. “Please, Father. Please give big brother Yun and I your blessing. I promise I’ll listen to you about everything else, so please…”

“Enough already.” Hua Fuchen put a hand to his forehead and sighed. If there was one thing he couldn’t handle at this day and age, it was his daughter softening him up with honeyed words and gestures to get her way.

He sighed. “I’ve been at your mother’s grave for the past week.”

“...” Hua Caili opened her mouth but didn’t know what to say.

“I spoke a lot with your mother, and I’ve thought things over again and again. In the end though, I could not truly overcome the obstacle lodged in my heart.” It was clear that there was unresolved struggle in his voice, though it was quickly overtaken by deep helplessness. “But just the same, I am unable to ignore your aunt’s words either…”

“Right now, your body and soul are bound to that boy. If I separate the two of you by force, your heart will shatter, and your soul will break in half. No matter the reason and good intentions, I would be hurting you deeply.”

Hua Fuchen’s words caused stars to form in Hua Caili’s eyes bit by bit. She said excitedly, “Father… a-are you saying that you’re willing to—!”

“I said nothing.” Hua Fuchen interrupted her but changed his tone. “However, I can give him a chance.”

“Wah!” This time, the stars in Hua Caili’s eyes positively erupted. She cheered, “You’re the best, Father! I knew you would—”

“Listen to me until the end, will you?” Hua Fuchen raised his voice and forcefully pushed down his daughter’s excitement. “Make no mistake, I haven’t accepted your relationship. I am just giving him a chance. It is up to him whether he can grasp it.”

“I will give him three trials. If he manages to overcome all three trials, then…”

The gigantic pressure in his heart ultimately caused him to falter for a moment. It took him a while before he finally managed to continue, “Then I will see your wish fulfilled no matter what resistance lies ahead on your path; no matter what price I have to pay.”

It sounded like he was speaking to Hua Caili, but it was really an affirmation of his own resolve.

If Yun Che really proved himself to be someone he could entrust Hua Caili to, then for her sake, he would bear any consequences.

His dignity, his future, his life.

He could surrender everything.

If Yun Che failed his trials… then he would break them up no matter the injury he would inflict upon Hua Caili. Even if her heart and soul were ripped into pieces, he would extinguish their relationship at first notice.

Hua Caili’s joy immediately turned colder. “Three trials… Father, you’re not using this as an excuse to put big brother Yun in an indefensible position, are you?”

Hua Fuchen flicked her in the forehead and grunted in irritation, “I am the Heart Painter Divine Regent. You think I would resort to such low-handed tactics against a junior? Hmph! I get it now. Since you have Yun Che, your Father is no more than a villain in your eyes.”

“No, no!” Hua Caili hurriedly begged. “Father is the best Father in the world! So… Can you tell me what the three trials are? Like, just between me and you? I swear I won’t tell big brother Yun about them!”

Hua Fuchen side-eyed her. “You couldn’t even keep the Pure Land’s secret from him, and you expect me to believe that you will keep the trials a secret from him?”

“Come,” he rose to his feet, “I will see that boy now.”

“You don’t seem anxious in the slightest,” Li Suo remarked with clear worry in her voice.

“There’s nothing to be anxious about.” Yun Che was lying on a jade recliner in the courtyard as if he was taking a restful nap at his own residence. “Besides, I’ll be leaving this place in a couple more days.”

“Are you saying… that Hua Fuchen will ultimately expel you from the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God?” Li Suo sounded confused. “This is not what you said would happen earlier.”

“It isn’t. You just misunderstood my words.” Yun Che chuckled. “A monarch must be heartless, but Caili is far too important to Hua Fuchen. He will make the compromise once he has gotten over his initial fury and reluctance, no matter what it costs him.”

“But of course, this compromise doesn’t come free. That is what I’m waiting for. I am waiting for him to make me an ‘offer’ I cannot refuse.”

“It should come any day now.” Yun Che whispered, “In another day or two at most, he will appear before me. I wonder how he will phrase it?”

“If it was me, I would probably call it a ‘trial.’”

He was still thinking when suddenly, Hua Lianzhi’s urgent voice entered his ears, “Young master Yun, elder sister and Father just showed up!”

Yun Che immediately shot up straight like a spring.

Here it comes… he secretly sucked in a deep breath.

He stood up just in time to see Hua Fuchen and Hua Caili crossing through the barrier. He immediately went up to them and bowed slightly. “Junior Yun Che greets the Heart Painter Divine Regent.”

“Big brother Yun!” Hua Caili had been walking shoulder-to-shoulder with Hua Fuchen, but the second she saw her lover, she immediately ran up to him and hugged his arm so tightly it was as if she wanted to mold the limb into her own body.

“...” Hua Fuchen’s temper flared up for an instant before he forced it back down.

Sigh. When a daughter comes of age, she will be married off… or she will marry herself off whether you like it or not.

“Boy.” Hua Fuchen began with eyes as cold as chilled swords. Today, he was bringing his full dignity as a divine regent to bear. “Let us speak. Alone.”

As soon as he said this, he walked straight toward the pavilion on the right side of the courtyard, back facing toward the couple.

Hua Caili secretly squeezed Yun Che’s palm before voicing her worry, “Father, you… you’re not allowed to scare him, okay? Not… not even I’ve scared him, so…”

“...” Hua Fuchen did not say anything, but he could feel a growing pain in his liver.

Yun Che gave Hua Caili a comforting look. Then, he slowly fell in behind Hua Fuchen.

It did not look like Hua Fuchen was doing anything, but an isolating barrier automatically appeared around them. In an instant, they were completely cut off from the outside world.

Hua Fuchen finally turned around to face Yun Che. His gaze was mighty, but not intrusive. Even so, the natural, invisible pressure he exuded—one who stood at the pinnacle of the Abyss—was enough to cause most souls to quake in fear.

“Yun Che,” he said indifferently and without emotion, “it’s been a week. Have you changed your mind?”

Yun Che replied respectfully, “Heaven and earth as my witness, my love for Caili transcends death, senior. It will never change.”

“Hmph!” Hua Fuchen’s voice grew a little colder. “What a coincidence. My mind hasn’t changed either. No matter what happens, I will never allow the two of you to be together!”

Yun Che abruptly looked up and pleaded urgently, “Senior, I—!”

“Calm. Don’t be so eager to prove your ‘sincerity.’” Hua Fuchen interrupted him. “Wait until you’ve heard my next words first.”

Yun Che stopped and answered, “Very well. This junior is listening.”

Hua Fuchen turned away and clasped his hands behind his back. He began, “Understand that it is all too easy for me to sever your and Caili’s relationship. One thought, one finger’s worth of power, and I can wipe your very existence from this world.”

“However, you did save Caili’s life. I can never do such a thing to my daughter’s savior.”

His voice abruptly hardened, “But just because I won’t do it doesn’t mean that others can’t or won’t.”

“Dian Jiuzhi, the Boundless Divine Son shares an official engagement with Caili, and he has been waiting for Caili for countless years. Say what you want, but his love for Caili may be deeper than even yours.”

“There are two things in this world a man can never tolerate. The murder of their father, and the loss of their partner.”

“At your current ability, how easy do you think it would be for him to kill you where you stand? About as much effort as me, I reckon: none.”

Yun Che replied fearlessly, “This junior has thought about all this from the moment I made up my mind to be together with Caili. The fury of a Divine Son is scary, but since I have made up my mind, neither fear nor regret may plague me anymore.”

“You’re not afraid?” Hua Fuchen sneered. “How dare you say you’re not afraid!”

He abruptly turned to glare at Yun Che. “Tell me this: who is the one who saved your life? Who is the one who taught you everything; gave you everything?”

The question caught Yun Che off guard, but he quickly regained his composure. “My master. When I was ten years old and without memories, he was the one who treated my grievous injuries and awoke me from my coma. I owe him all of my current abilities.”

“It is good that you know that,” Hua Fuchen said, “Caili’s aunt once said that you possess many astounding qualities. In fact, you may be the sole owner of those qualities in the entire Abyss.”

“Your master is probably a soul fragment of an impossibly powerful and ancient god. He gave you new life and made you the inheritor of his power and the proof of his existence. But you are still young, and your wings aren’t fully grown yet. You haven’t even managed to show off a glimmer of your master’s radiance yet, and you are going to give up your life for a love that is born from sheer irrationality?!”

“Do you really think you can look your master in the face and say that you’ve made the right choice?!”

Yun Che was going to say something, but Hua Fuchen pushed on. “Besides, if you really do wish Caili well, you definitely should have left her as soon as possible. I’ve already explained to you why you should make this choice, but to think that you weren’t shaken in the slightest even though you’ve had a whole week to think about it. I cannot help but wonder if you truly love Caili, or if it’s just your selfish desire dictating your actions!!”

Yun Che did not refute his accusation. He simply said, “To want to be together with your loved ones forever is a selfish desire. I don’t see a difference between the two.”

“Hah. Save your sophistry for yourself.” A cold smile spread across Hua Fuchen’s face. “You only need to know one thing. I will never, ever, give Caili to you, and your twisted entanglement will end today. The only reason you’re allowed to reside in this Kingdom of God to this day is because you saved Caili’s life. You are here only because I tolerated it—but no more.”

Hua Fuchen made a waving motion, and a jade fox a little over two meters long and surrounded by profound energy appeared on a stone table.

“The Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God is not in the habit of owing favors. Inside this jade box is one of the strongest divine swords forged in the Sword Forging Pavilion named the ‘Nine Stars Flowing Gold Clouds.’ It is on par with the swords of the Seven Sword Sovereigns, so you should have an idea just how powerful it is. Not only that, it is also a symbol of status. To wield it is akin to wielding our kingdom’s name. No one will dare to stand in your path, and you may command anyone to do your bidding.”

“Besides that, I’ll be giving you three Soul Tempering Pills and three Body Tempering Pills. The level of these pills is such that even Half-Gods would go crazy for one, much less six of them! I promise you that this is a level of luxury not even our most talented juniors only dare to dream of.”

Hua Fuchen turned around and tapped a finger on the stone table. Then, while staring at Yun Che with imposing eyes, he said, “Take these gifts and bid Caili goodbye. Then, leave the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God of your own accord.”

“Of course, you can make another choice. You can cling onto your so-called fearlessness and be expelled from the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God instead. You can continue living with foolishness and obsession while trying to stop the wheels of history with your powerless arms. You can bury your dazzling life and your master’s expectations with your own two hands.”

Hua Fuchen thought for sure that his words would cause Yun Che to waver at least a little… but in reality, it was the opposite. Forget wavering, he couldn’t even pick up a hint of concern from the young man.

Yun Che glanced at the jade box exactly once. That was all. He never looked at it again even after hearing about the Nine Stars Flowing Gold Cloud or pills.

Still maintaining a respectful but firm demeanor, he answered, “My master has never given me his kindness with any ulterior motive in mind, and he definitely did not try to put any sort of shackles on me. On the contrary, he wishes for me to live the life I want to lead.”

“The Boundless Divine Son’s hatred is scary, but it is rational and within expectations. Caili and my love have surpassed death itself, so what else do I have to be afraid of?”

He lifted his head and looked straight into Hua Fuchen’s eyes with unbending pride. “If you must expel me, this junior can do nothing but be expelled. However, my oath will not change. So long as Caili doesn’t give up on me, I will never give up on her. Heaven and earth as my witness, not even death can change my mind!”

Hua Fuche matched his gaze for several breaths straight. Then, he withdrew his divine aura and let out a quiet sigh. “You are a stubborn one, boy.”

He waved his hand, and the barrier disappeared in an instant.

“Big brother Yun!”

Hua Caili immediately rushed over and embraced Yun Che tightly. Her smile was brighter than the sun as she boasted, “You see that, Father? I told you big brother Yun’s love for me wouldn’t waver so easily!”

“Huh?” Her words surprised Yun Che.

“To be honest, what happened just now was Father’s trial for you.” Hua Caili exposed her Father without mercy. “The barrier he set up isn’t a full isolating barrier either. Aunt and I could see you and hear you as clear as day.”

“A trial?” Yun Che’s surprise deepened. “What trial?” “Well, Father said he’s going to give you three trials. If big brother Yun passes all of them, he will cancel my engagement with the Boundless Kingdom of God and give us permission to be together!”

Yun Che had completed the first trial perfectly. So perfect, in fact, that Hua Caili almost felt like victory was in the bag already.

Yun Che’s surprise quickly morphed into joy. He stammered with barely suppressed agitation, “I-I see. Thank you for granting this junior a chance, senior divine regent. No matter what trials you set for me, this junior swears that he will give it his all and prove my love for Caili.”

“Hmph!” Hua Fuchen grunted in annoyance. “Why are you acting like it’s already over? This was just the first trial.”

As soon as he finished, he flew up and out of the courtyard in an instant. “Follow me, boy. Caili, you will not be coming with us.”

Hua Caili was in the air already, but Hua Fuchen’s words stopped her in her tracks. She did not dare to disobey her Father considering how much effort it had taken just to loosen his jaw a little. She could only stomp her foot in frustration.

Hua Qingying appeared beside her. “Your Father took him to the Sword Breaker Platform. I can take you there, but we can only observe from afar, and you must watch in complete silence.”

“Got it!” Hua Caili nodded hurriedly. “You’re the best, aunt!”

The Sword Breaker Platform sported a platform that was dozens of kilometers wide and had tens of thousands of swords. The sword qi permeating the air felt like the sea itself.

Hua Fuchen took Yun Che all the way to the center of the Sword Breaker Platform. After they landed, a gigantic barrier activated and isolated it from the outside.

Even now, he wasn’t willing to expose Yun Che’s existence to too many people.

Yun Che looked around for a bit before asking, “Are you planning to test my sword next, senior divine regent?”

Hua Fuchen clasped his hands behind his back and stayed silent. So, Yun Che kept quiet as well.

A moment later, a hole appeared on the barrier. Whistles of swords could be heard as three figures entered the barrier together.

After they landed on the platform, they immediately paid their respects to Hua Fuchen simultaneously.

“Your son Hua Wanxiao/Hua Mengyu/Hua Guiyuan greets Father.”

Hua Wanxiao was the oldest of the three, so he bowed and asked, “Why have you summoned us here, Father?”

Instead of answering, Hua Fuchen looked at Yun Che and said, “I heard that you could rival an early-stage Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner as a level three Divine Master. It is common for geniuses to reach over the gaps of minor realms and defeat someone stronger than them, but this? If it wasn’t Caili’s aunt who told me about this, I would not have believed even half a word of it.”

The three princes turned to look at Yun Che at the same time. Their eyes had turned odd as soon as they heard that statement. If Hua Fuchen wasn’t right in front of them, they would’ve burst out laughing already.

“So, I decided to confirm this claim with my own eyes.”

He turned to look at the three princes. “These are the three sons I have who successfully broke through to the Divine Extinction Realm in the past one thousand years or so. They have all solidified their cultivation at level one Divine Extinction Realm.”

“Choose one of them to be your opponent. If you win… forget it. If you can even eke out a draw, then I will consider you to have passed the test. But if you lose, then it proves that you had used some sort of method to fool Caili and her aunt, and that you really harbor ulterior motives. I don’t need to tell you the consequences of such malice.”

“But—!” Hua Guiyuan blurted, though he restrained himself immediately.

To become a Half-God at their age, they were without a doubt the cream of the crop that was their kinsmen. But now, they were made to fight a nobody who was just a level three Divine Master?

All three princes exchanged ugly looks with each other. If this wasn’t Hua Fuchen’s order, if Hua Fuchen was anyone else, they would view it as a grave insult to their honor.

Hua Fuchen shot his three sons a look before continuing, “Since they are the princes of the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God, they naturally practice the sword. However, they all cultivate different profound arts and ways of the sword. As for who will prove the best match for you, that is up to you to decide for yourself.”

“There’s no need.”

Hua Fuchen had just finished talking when Yun Che spoke up, “The three princes came all the way here. I cannot send them away for nothing.”

He raised his hand and beckoned the three princes to come at him. “I choose… to fight all three of them.”
