“In the beginning of the Abyss, when the ‘Land of the Living’ had not yet taken form, there was abyssal dust everywhere, far more terrifying than there is now, causing many True Gods to fall.”

“Then, Uncle Abyssal Monarch used a powerful profound artifact to create the very first ‘Land of the Living’, allowing more and more gods to survive. To ensure long-term survival, they began to gradually reproduce and expand the ‘Land of the Living’.”

“However, probably due to the effects of the abyssal dust, their offspring found it difficult to cultivate into True Gods again, dwindling the number of True Gods. If this continued, with the passing of each True God, the power of the True Gods might eventually cease to exist in the Abyss."

“As such, Uncle Abyssal Monarch chose seven of the most suitable True Gods, seized their True God divine origins before they fell, and then created seven divine cores through seven special profound artifacts."

“These seven divine cores brought about the six kingdoms that have continued to this day."

Yun Che listened meticulously to Hua Caili’s narration, and interjected, “If I understand correctly, after each generation of Divine Regent abdicates, the True God Divine Origin that was inherited can be directly passed onto the next Divine Regent through the divine core?”

“That’s right! Big brother Yun is so smart.” Hua Caili praised.

Yun Che curled his lips slightly. This inheritance method was essentially the same as inheritance in the King Realms. But then again, the King Realms’ inheritance method did originate from the primordial god race.

One was the power of a Divine Master, and the other was the power of a True God. Although the methods were similar, the levels and difficulties involved were worlds apart.

“But this inheritance is not random.” Hua Caili hugged Yun Che’s arm, her entire body half-tilting on his body as she continued to narrate. “Not only do you need to have a similar bloodline and compatible profound arts, you also need the really really important divine essence.”

“I’ve heard of ‘divine essence’ before, but I don’t really understand it. What is it?”

The first time Yun Che first heard of the word “divine essence” was not in the Abyss but from Chi Wuyao. However, his knowledge was very shallow, and he only knew that if he wanted to bear the power of a True God, he needed to possess at least eighty percent divine essence.

Hua Caili pondered for a moment and explained. “Everyone has fifty-four profound entrances which will open as one’s cultivation improves. After the profound entrances are fully open, subtle changes will occur within the profound veins, as if there are more independent ‘small worlds,’ hence changing one’s ability to harness and carry profound power.

“The quantity of these ‘small worlds’ is divine essence.”

“Oh, I see.” Yun Che said thoughtfully.

“The vast majority of profound practitioners have thirty to fifty percent divine essence, and those who exceed fifty are already extremely rare. If one wants to become a ‘God Bearer’ of a kingdom, they must have at least eighty percent divine essence. If the divine essence cannot bear the power of a True God, it will fail because their profound veins will not be able to withstand it and the consequences of failure are often very, very tragic. It is possible for their profound veins to get crippled, and even death is possible.”

“But there are exceptions. The Eternal Night Kingdom of God’s Lightless Divine Regent who forcefully bore the divine origin with her seventy percent divine essence eventually succeeded miraculously, but not without a price. Her divine name ‘Lightless’ and the reason she changed the name of her kingdom to ‘Eternal Night,’ are because she lost her sight forever as a result.”

Hua Caili suddenly said with some emotion, “I heard that in the world called the ‘Eternal Pure Land,’ the lifespans of the True Gods are all very, very long. Even longer than the history of the Abyss. But the True Gods that bear the divine origin of the True Gods have instead shortened lifespans.

“The longest lifespan of a kingdom’s Divine Regent has never exceeded fifty thousand years.”

“Huh?” Yun Che glanced to the side, and said half-jokingly, “With you looking like this, are you afraid that if you inherit divine power in the future, you won't be able to live as long as me?”

“Right.” Hua Caili directly nodded her head and admitted, “I want to inherit Father’s divine power earlier so I can always protect you, but I am also afraid that my lifespan will be shortened because of it. What if there’s no one left to protect you once I’m gone...”

She said that in an exceptionally serious tone while looking at Yun Che.

“You’re not allowed to think about these strange things.” Yun Che shook his head, smiling. “Do I look like someone who’s easily bullied?”

“I just want to be with you a little longer.” Hua Caili shook Yun Che’s arm and mumbled, “If only I had the Nine Profound Exquisite Body.”

“...” Yun Che’s footsteps stiffened for a moment, before very naturally asking, “What’s the Nine Profound Exquisite Body?”

“A kind of miraculous talent that only appears in women.” Hua Caili answered with quite some longing. “It’s actually not that accurate for the divine essence to be called ‘small worlds’ in the profound veins, but someone who possesses the Nine Profound Exquisite Body actually has a small world called the ‘Exquisite World’ in their profound veins.”

“Due to this ‘Exquisite World’, their ability to carry and harness profound power is far superior to others. It is said that for those who possess the Nine Profound Exquisite Body, even if they do not have similar profound veins and do not practice a compatible profound art, they only need to reach the Divine Extinction Realm to be able to bear any kind of True God Divine Origin.”

“Instead of having their life devoured after bearing the True God power, their lifespan will be much longer.”

Yun Che revealed a well-timed astonishment. “There’s actually such a miraculous heaven-given physique in the world, amazing. Is there someone with the Nine Profound Exquisite Body in this world?”

Hua Caili gently shook her head. “It is said that in ancient times, one would appear once in every tens of thousands of years but it has been extinct since hundreds of thousands of years ago and has never re-appeared so far. Of course, it could be that it is being completely hidden to not let others know about it.”

“Why?” Yun Che asked while fully aware of the answer.

“Because, because...” Hua Caili was a bit shy to speak but still tried, “It is said that people with the Nine Profound Exquisite Body are the best... dual cultivation incubators. Those women with the Nine Profound Exquisite Body that have appeared in history were all abducted by the people of the kingdoms and most of them ended badly.”

“Those who possessed the Nine Profound Exquisite Body have a very special kind of nine revolutions, profound energy that is particularly recognizable in their initial stages of cultivation. Only by cultivating to the Divine Origin Realm can this special aura be hidden completely. Therefore, based on the lessons learned from history, unless they are born in a Kingdom of God, people who possess this kind of divine talent will do their utmost to hide it.”

“True.” Yun Che’s gaze was deep. “A weak person who harbors treasure is guilty even if they’re innocent.”

“Oh right!” Hua Caili’s eyes suddenly flashed. “Big brother Yun, do you want to see what percent divine essence you have? I’ll tell you the method, it’s very simple.”

“Forget about it.” Yun Che said indifferently. “It’s not like I’m someone from a Kingdom of God, let alone a God Bearer.”

After his Heretic God’s Profound Veins were complete, he saw an endless starry sky.

Without waiting for Hua Caili to insist, he hastily pointed ahead, “Look, there’s a small city over there. Let’s go find a place to cultivate.”

They had already walked out of the Endless Fog several days ago and stepped into the Land of the Living.

However, the Land of the Living was also divided in hierarchy. The closer they were to the Kingdoms of God, the weaker the abyssal dust was. The higher the status and level, the more strong people gathered.

After arriving in the city, Yun Che rented a resting area for six hundred hours with ten small abyssal crystals.

This kind of resting area was actually a small, independent space that could isolate a majority of abyssal dust and was used to rent out to profound practitioners who needed to rest or recuperate from injuries. There were a large number of resting areas in every Land of the Living.

For Yun Che and Hua Caili, it was a relatively quiet place for cultivation.

The two of them did not release their profound power or use weapons. Hua Caili used her finger as a sword and the sword energy she drew was still as dazzling as the stars in the sky.

Yun Che only defended and did not attack, using his fingers to break the moves with his power transformed into a sword. The two of them fought for several hours in a row, trying out countless variations.

Although he had already left the Endless Fog and Hua Caili had already made a great realm breakthrough, Yun Che did not slack off in her cultivation. After all, she was still in the midst of her training agreement.

With Hua Qingying there, he couldn’t let Hua Caili indulge in the pleasures of men and women, or else he would surely cause her to resent him.

At this time, Hua Caili’s eyes suddenly flashed. Her snowy hand stretched out and the Glass Cloud Sword flew her grasp as it lightly stabbed out.

There was sword cry or sword energy. The only thing present in Yun Che’s perception was the coldness that seemed to exist and slightly shrink his soul.

His footsteps retreated but he stopped in midair, halfway through his movements.

Nine streaks of sword beams appeared around his body at this moment, pressing against his body and sealing all his actions.

This scene caused Hua Qingying to stare fixedly, unable to move her gaze for a long time.

With a light sound, all the sword energy disappeared. Deep joy surfaced on Hua Caili’s face as she looked at the Glass Cloud Sword in her hand. Then, she suddenly pounced on Yun Che and hugged him tightly, “Big brother Yun, I have finally mastered the Heaven Breaker’s first sword. Yay!”

Hua Qingying softly murmured, “How could it be so fast...”

The shock she was receiving at this moment far surpassed what she felt during that great realm breakthrough.

Each sword style of the Heaven Breaker Sword was extremely difficult to comprehend, master, and even more difficult to progress. This was something she knew better than anyone else.

Hua Caili had comprehended the Heaven Breaker’s first sword in less than three months.

Thinking back on her cultivation during this period of time... Ever since she met Yun Che, her sword force and sword intent had become so light and clean. It was as if her sword heart had brightened.

Sword heart brightened...

Hua Qingying suddenly felt something.

It appears that she has finally found a reason to wield the sword.

Yun Che, you must never fail her.

She had not yet realized that her thoughts were actually a kind of approval of Yun Che. At least, between Yun Che and Dian Jiuzhi, she was already subconsciously leaning toward Yun Che.

“As expected of my Caili.” Yun Che smiled and praised her. “I’m afraid that your father will be moved for a long time when he sees you.”

“Just in time... to give you a reward.”

He raised his hand and a tiny snow rabbit appeared, emitting the fresh scent of rice cakes.

“So cute.” Hua Caili cupped it in her hands, her eyes filled with myriad colors. “What’s the name of this little guy?”

“Snow rabbit.” Yun Che said. “A type of rabbit species. Beasts of this race all feed on ordinary grass and are not aggressive at all.”

“It’s so cute...” She surveyed it very seriously. “Since it’s so cute, it must be delicious.”

She bit down and the fragrance immediately filled her soul.

After walking out of the Endless Fog, Yun Che would create a new surprise for her every day. In particular, the food he made from the ordinary ingredients of the Land of the Living was not inferior to the rare treasures of the Pure Land.

“I knew it’d be delicious.” Hua Caili then suddenly stood on her tiptoes and shoved the remaining half into Yun Che’s mouth, “The butt’s for you.”

“Oh...” Yun Che was caught off guard and choked with stuffed cheeks, then swallowed it whole in one gulp.

His body turned and under Hua Caili’s exclamation of surprise, he had already pounced on her, his gaze full of undisguised aggression, “I rather eat you instead.”

“You can’t.” Hua Caili’s cheeks were dyed pink, her voice timid. “Aunt... will peek.”

Just as Yun Che was about to speak, Hua Caili had already quietly raised her hand, instantly setting up an isolated sword formation around them. Her arms wrapped tightly around Yun Che’s neck.

“Aunt can’t see like this. Big brother Yun is mine, no one is allowed to see.”

A pink tint gradually spread out, directly staining her snowy neck. Her beautiful eyes didn’t dare touch Yun Che but her legs had already quietly wrapped around his waist, feeling the close contact with him.

“...” Hua Qingying’s figure retreated far away, and after a complex change in her expression, she slowly exhaled a breath.

The Abyssal Qilin God disaster made her no longer dare to be the slightest bit lax about Hua Caili’s well-being, and so she couldn’t move too far away.

After a long time, when she thought that the two had already finished, her divine perception came down, passing through the sword formation. It encountered Hua Caili’s soft and tender whimpers, and retreated lightning fast, leaving her sword heart disorientated for a few breaths.

She couldn’t imagine how Hua Fuchen would react when he found out that Hua Caili had lost her virginity to Yun Che.

“Pay attention now. This man is called Little Handsome and this woman is called Little Beauty. Little Handsome’s father saved Little Beauty’s life so Little Beauty’s father told Little Beauty to marry Little Handsome to repay the favor of saving her life.”

Yun Che fiddled with the two small wooden figures on the ground and told Hua Caili a strange story.

“But then, Little Handsome was born with crippled profound veins and Little Beauty was extremely gifted. If the two were to marry, the nicest way to phrase it would be that the weak was seeking help from the strong while the nastiest way to phrase it would be that it was a delusional dream.

“So did the two cancel their engagement?” Hua Caili asked.

“Not really. Little Beauty still married Little Handsome, but she clearly told him that it was only to repay the debt and to save his face, that there were no feelings involved. The two separated soon after they were married.”

“However, Little Handsome was proud and arrogant. He found a way to repair his profound veins and diligently cultivated. After many fortuitous encounters, he finally met Little Beauty again and defeated her, proving to her that he had the qualifications to be worthy of her, that it was not just her repaying her debt and taking pity on him.” 𝘧𝓇ℯ𝑒𝓌𝑒𝑏𝓃𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝒸ℴ𝓂

Yun Che put the two little wooden figures together, indicating that he had finished the story.

“Today’s story is so boring.” Hua Caili held her cheeks and then softly fell onto Yun Che’s lap. “There won’t be any sort of weak relying on the strong or any delusional dreams between us. I only need you in this life, and you can only be my big brother Yun.”

“Hm, I guess it is a bit boring.” Yun Che sighed to himself in his heart, “Who would’ve thought that such a boring start would conceal so much karma.”
