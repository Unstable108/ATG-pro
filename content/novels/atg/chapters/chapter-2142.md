The profound energy phenomenon created by the Glazed Glass Ice was, in fact, not unfamiliar to Yun Che. As the bearer of the original Dragon God bloodline, he was the absolute bane of all existing dragons. His soul did not just terrify the dragons; any power they flung his way would shrink of its own accord.

In the God Realm, the late Long Bai was the possessor of the Dragon God bloodline and the supreme overlord of Primal Chaos. However, the dragon’s attacks were weakened by one-third before they even got close to him.

The outcome produced by the Glazed Glass Ice was similar, but the nature was completely different. The Glazed Glass Ice did not cause profound energy to cower or wane. Instead, it was as if the profound energy... gained some sort of sentience and chose to avoid the Glazed Glass Ice, unwilling to damage it or block its way.

The Glazed Glass Ice itself wasn’t strong, but its origin, exceedingly special and pure Way conceptually “diminished” another person’s strength to an incredible degree. It allowed Shenwu Yi, a sixth-level Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner, to easily defend against the power of level eight Divine Extinction Realm Great Rage and pierce Dian Jiuzhi’s defenses. It was all because the Divine Son’s profound energy had suddenly become “lazy”.

Yun Che whispered, “So this is the true face of the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass...”

Just like the Nine Profound Exquisite Body, he had learned about the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass a long time ago. Rumors and records regarding the heart were numerous and disorderly. Generally speaking, everyone agreed that a person born with the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass possessed a transparent heart and soul and was protected by the heavenly laws. When they “awakened”, they would definitely become a sovereign of some sort. It was also agreed that they possessed powerful fates.

Out of the many commonly agreed-upon theories, the protection of the heavenly law was the most popular of them all. Some people believed it with all their heart, and some people disregarded it completely.

These rumors and records were the sum of all special characteristics every person with the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass had ever displayed throughout history. However, no one knew where the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass originated from or why it was named “Glazed Glass”—none of the records ever mentioned anything like that.

It wasn’t until now that he discovered the truth. No one ever knew about its true essence because said essence had been wiped out by the dirty dust of the mortal coil even before the Era of Gods had truly arrived.

Her “Exquisite Body” and “Glazed Glass Heart” had explicit expressions in her original world. They allowed her to overcome laws, see through the dangerous jungle of a person’s heart, and plan the bigger picture, even though her knowledge and experience were exceedingly shallow compared to her peers'. However, neither quality had fully explained why the “Exquisite Body” was exquisite, or why the “Glazed Glass Heart” was named “Glazed Glass”.

To think that it was because both qualities were just “sprouts” when she was still in the God Realm.

But... Why did this happen? How did this happen? What happened to her during the decades she fell into the Abyss? How on earth did she undergo such a dramatic change? A being created by the Ancestral God... the Ancestral God’s holy aura... a causeless person... isolated from her original universe and severed from karma forever, she was no longer an Artifact of Fate. She no longer had any past or her previous memories...

Is she still herself then? Should I call her Shenwu Yi as she is now, or should I... selfishly... remind her of the name Xia Qingyue, and drag her back to her old fate...?

Dian Jiuzhi’s response to the second glazed glass profound seal was to make a grab for it. He seemed to be trying to prove something.

The glazed glass profound seal wasn’t spatially curved. It slammed directly against Dian Jiuzhi’s arm.

There was an icy explosion, and the glazed glass profound seal shattered to smithereens. However, the terrible cold still invaded his marrow, froze the blood in his arm, and condensed his profound qi. As a result, he could not move the limb for a time.

This time, though, Dian Jiuzhi clearly sensed that his power of Great Rage had blocked only about half of the attack, an attack at only the sixth level of the Divine Extinction Realm. His extraordinarily powerful body had also become frozen as if it had lost most of its natural instinct to reject foreign forces. It had become so lazy that it allowed the cold energy to invade as it pleased.

The endless wave of absurdity just kept stacking up inside his soul sea. The world inside the barrier felt like a bizarre and fantastical dream.

A sharp, cold light stabbed his eyes once more. Shenwu Yi had conjured her third glazed glass profound seal while he was distracted. Brimming with the immense power of Remove the Dust, the three-meter-wide seal enveloped everything within a three-kilometer radius with icy power. 𝒻𝓇𝑒𝘦𝘸𝑒𝒷𝓃ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝘮

Dian Jiuzhi closed his eyes. In fact, he sealed off all five of his senses.

The attack could not be dodged, perceived, or blocked... in that case, he shall not see, hear, or feel! This way, he would not feel pain, surprise, or fear.

He had already made a fool of himself. He would not allow the Boundless Kingdom of God’s dignity to be trampled as well!

The power of Great Rage surged out like a flood, bursting the blood vessels of his arms and breaking the skin and flesh. It had penetrated his frozen arms almost cruelly. The silver light that dimmed just a moment ago also swelled like a silver sun and enveloped his whole body.

The glazed glass “Remove the Dust” seal descended from the sky and sealed off the space he was in. However, Dian Jiuzhi could not feel it as he was currently senseless. His rampaging power of Great Rage morphed into a massive shadow that was a little over thirty meters tall. However, the spiritual pressure it unleashed could not be outmatched even by a thirty-kilometer-tall mountain of mountains.

The next moment, “Remove the Dust” crashed down on Dian Jiuzhi like a meteor from the Beyond. Affected by translucent ice, strange ripples washed across the surface of the thick silver light like neatly cut water. When “Remove the Dust” passed through the silver light, the intensity of its icy light had only diminished by sixty percent. The rest struck Dian Jiuzhi’s body and exploded violently.

Icy light bloomed amid the silver radiance, distorting it significantly. The freezing of profound energy caused the thirty-meter-tall shadow to shrink to just twenty-one meters. This time, the ice did not just freeze the bones, but also the soul. It no longer surprised Dian Jiuzhi or caused him to recoil, though. He did not even bother to dispel the cold energy. Still keeping his five senses sealed, the twenty-one-meter-tall shadow punched upward with the rampant power of the Divine Vein of Great Rage.

“Boundless Manifestation... Great Rage Consumes The Star!”

BOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMM—

Silver light enveloped the sky. At that moment, not even the barrier was able to isolate the destructive blaze of destruction that illuminated the entire Eden’s Crown.

Cries of surprise filled the temple as Yun Che’s gaze sharpened. He clearly saw a three-meter-wide gap embedded in the middle of the sky of destructive silver. It shimmered like pure, flawless ice, keeping Shenwu Yi untouched. Wherever the raging torrent of destruction made contact with the icy light, it automatically transformed into gentle, harmless beams that circled it. Not a single wisp could make an entry.

One breath... two breaths... three breaths... the power was great enough to destroy heaven and earth, and yet it just could not break or even damage the fragile crystal.

As the silver light waned, the battlefield was revealed once more. Everyone saw Shenwu Yi create ice with her sword and weave a profound seal resembling four leaves. As soon as the seal took form, it immediately shed all of its color and became perfectly transparent.

“Cleanse the Heart... sss! Just how far into the Shenwu World Purifying Seal is she!?” Meng Jianxi exclaimed in shock.

At the same time, the temporarily resting power of Great Rage exploded once more. In fact, it seemed more berserk than before. The silver light tangled around Dian Jiuzhi’s body looked like waves of roaring thunder or raging sea.

His power detonated at the same time Cleanse the Heart descended. He chanted words that came from his soul sea and only he himself could hear clearly, “Boundless Manifestation... Ruin of Rage Crushes the Sea!”

The instant the power of Great Rage surged, the space within the barrier and even the gazes cast into it were warped instantly. The Purify God Seal and the power of Great Rage engulfed their targets at nearly the same time. Icy explosions echoed inside Dian Jiuzhi’s soul sea, and he could clearly sense that his soul had become as cold as his body. His profound energy was also flowing unbelievably slowly and stutteringly as if it was impeded by countless layers of ice.

Still, he did not release his five senses and check out his physical wounds. Instead, he gathered all of his concentration and focused on channeling the power residing within his Divine Vein of Great Rage.

Eighth-level Divine Extinction Realm versus sixth-level Divine Extinction Realm... even if he was going to lose, he wasn’t going down in an ugly fashion. Uglier than it already was anyway.

The wavy, destructive power annihilated everything within the barrier. The space of Eden’s Crown was impossibly resilient, and yet shallow marks were appearing here and there as if it was threatening to break apart. As the power covered the whole battlefield, it did not matter where Shenwu Yi was standing.

Just like before, the waves of destruction suddenly split apart like cut water as soon as they made contact with the icy, glazed glass crystal.

Ice was spreading across Dian Jiuzhi’s body, and it was only growing thicker over time. His face was rapidly losing its color as well. However, for the first time, Shenwu Yi’s glazed glass barrier lost its perfect tranquility. Cracks could be seen forming on it. Although the cracks were minor at best, they were all the more conspicuous due to how excessively flawless the crystal was.

Shenwu Yi’s expression did not change. Deeper light shone out of her icy pupils, and the cracks on the glazed glass crystal began healing... only to spread open again. It looked as if a temporary balance was achieved.

The silver light dimmed once more, and the waves of destruction began receding. It was at this moment that Dian Jiuzhi slowly raised his right arm—his movements were clearly stiff and painful—and the fading silver light abruptly swelled to full intensity once more. When he punched the ground with his right arm, his body—the power of the previous skill still flowing out of him—unleashed a level of destructive power that wasn’t inferior to his previous showing in the slightest.

“Boundless Manifestation... Eight Rages Shatter the Realm!”

At that moment, space shuddered violently, and silver light filled every inch of the sky. It looked as if heaven and earth had been flipped upside down. As an endless amount of power of Great Rage flooded out of Dian Jiuzhi’s body, the icy cracks that had almost entirely disappeared from the glazed glass barrier abruptly split wide open and spread to most of the barrier. Then, they slowly grew, unstoppable, until they encompassed the entire crystal.

One breath, two breaths, three breaths... four breaths... five breaths!!

The silver light finally faded, but just before it did, the mysterious glazed glass barrier shattered as well. As the final wisp of power of Great Rage swept across Shenwu Yi, her healthy complexion instantly turned white, and a thin stream of blood trickled down the corner of her lips.

However, that was all. The next moment, ten thousand ancient eras' worth of cold gathered inside her eyes. Shenwu Yi thrust the Heartbreak Sting forward and unleashed a burst of colorless ice. Countless icy petals took form as it shot through the air. By the time it approached Dian Jiuzhi, it had transformed into a fantastical, icy snow lotus in full bloom.

BAAAAAAAAANNNNNNGGGGGGGGGG—

The snow lotus of ice exploded against Dian Jiuzhi’s body and sent icy crystals flying all over the place. The light they refracted looked gorgeous beyond words. Dian Jiuzhi was in the middle of forcing out the power of Great Rage once more when his body suddenly stiffened, and the beating silver light giving its all to last just a little longer froze in place. Then winked out like a mirage and died completely.

It was a frozen hell inside Dian Jiuzhi’s soul sea. Wherever he probed, he could only find endless cold. He struggled with all of his willpower again and again... but in the end, he let out a quiet sigh.

“So be it...”

As soon as his five senses returned to normal, he fell backward like a mindless ice sculpture and hit the ground with a heavy thud. It was dead silent throughout Eden’s Crown. His flesh, blood, marrow, and even profound energy were frozen solid. It numbed him from the pain and even the existence of his physical body. Amidst the frozen nothingness, only one last sliver of clarity remained.

He did not allow his mind to slip into unconsciousness, however. Instead, he opened his frozen lips and voiced out as clearly as he could, “I... surrender[1].”

Shenwu Yi quietly put away the Heartless Sword and the Heartbreak Sting. The thin stream of blood coloring the corner of her lips was soundlessly wiped away as well.

The Chief Priest’s announcement followed right after, “Dian Jiuzhi of Boundless surrenders. Shenwu Yi of Eternal Night wins.”

Rumble! Throwing all caution to the wind, Dian Rahu leaped into the barrier with a thunderous boom and held up the frozen Dian Jianzhi. Then, he enveloped the man’s whole body with thick, warm waves of profound energy that swiftly dispelled the cold.

“Brother Jiuzhi!” Dian Sansi’s face was deathly pale. His foot kept moving forward and backward, and he fought against the impulse to join his father.

Dian Jiuzhi had lost... despite his absolute advantage in cultivation, age, and physical strength, he had lost. It was an outcome that too many people could not imagine, even in their dreams.

Judging from Dian Rahu’s shocked expression, Dian Jiuzhi hadn’t just lost; he had suffered a significant amount of injury. That said, many people lamented, but no one laughed at his defeat. Shenwu Yi’s Exquisite Profound Worlds and strange ice crystal were both things that broke, no, ripped common sense to shreds, so as shocking as Dian Jiuzhi’s defeat was, it wasn’t undeserved.

One thing was sure: the “number one Divine Son” of Abyss was no more after this battle. Instead, the name of the Eternal Night Divine Daughter replaced it. From now on, it would live in everyone’s memory, heart, and soul as a brand.

“Hahahahaha!! Hahahahahahahaha!”

Hoarse, insane laughter suddenly erupted out of nowhere and stabbed into everyone’s eardrums like countless poisoned needles. It pierced the ears and shook the soul.

“This is the so-called number one Divine Son? This is the so-called Divine Vein of Great Rage?? He’s an eighth-level Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner, and yet he lost to my sixth-level Divine Extinction Realm Divine Daughter like a frozen dog. What a joke! Hahahahahaha!”

No one present would choose this moment to taunt the Boundless Kingdom of God, nor would any Divine Regent deign to make such a venomous and lowly insult... no one, except the Lightless Divine Regent of the Eternal Night Kingdom of God.

Her vile laughter and taunt were, to be fair, completely expected. If he were any other Divine Regent, they most likely would choose to restrain their temper and not stoop to the level of a madwoman. However, he was the Boundless Divine Regent, the most fiery of them all.

After lifting Dian Rahu to a sitting position, Dian Rahu abruptly glared in the Lightless Divine Regent’s direction and erupted, “Silence!!”

“Hahahahaha!”

Shenwu Yanye continued to laugh, though, and each bark was only shriller and more soul-rending than the last. “What a Boundless Divine Son! Just a while ago, he dared to give ten breaths to his opponent, so I thought he must be oh-so-capable. But no, he is just a useless, ugly piece of garbage whose true self is exposed as soon as he encounters the slightest bit of resistance!”

“You are the man who raised this laughable idiot who shamed himself and his kingdom, Dian Rahu, so who are you to bark at me!? ”

Blue veins bulged big and scary on Dian Rahu’s arms, and his eyes looked like they would explode with berserking fury at any moment... However, this was the Pure Land. As angry as he was, he ultimately chose to push down his anger.

Besides, the loser should calmly accept the shame that came with defeat... That was how he taught Dian Jiuzhi.

The Boundless Divine Regent’s endurance did not earn the Lightless Divine Regent’s restraint. Sudden movement came from the pitch black palanquin she was sitting in, and a wisp of profound energy shot out. Amidst everyone’s shocked and puzzled gazes, the profound energy penetrated the barrier and struck Shenwu Yi squarely.

There was a boom, and Shenwu Yi was sent flying at least a hundred meters before she arrested herself. Without a word, the Divine Daughter landed on the floor and bowed. She said, “This useless Wuyi has disappointed you, Mother.”

Yun Che’s eyes instantly turned as cold as ice.

“And here I thought you were unaware!”

Shenwu Yanye’s voice sounded like that of a howling ghost from the depths. It was so terrifying that it shook everyone’s soul strings. “Your opponent is just Dian Jiuzhi, an ignorant, arrogant, and worthless piece of garbage from Boundless, and you took this long to defeat him and even suffered some minor injuries? Do you know that he could wring out every drop of his smelly, filthy blood into a bowl, and it still would not be worth a single drop of yours?!”

Shenwu Yi bowed her head and replied, “Wuyi knows she has erred.”

Around the palanquin, the women of Eternal Night were utterly silent. Their expressions were also unchanged, as if they had long gotten used to this sight.

Shock, befuddlement, and disbelief appeared on everyone’s faces in varying degrees. Then, it all morphed into sighs of pity and regret.

If Shenwu Yi had appeared in any other Kingdom of God, she would have been cherished and even worshiped like a god.

The Eternal Night Kingdom of God? The radiance so bright that it blinded even the Divine Regents was no more but a tool for the madwoman, Shenwu Yanye, to vent her hatred at the world.

“You better! In the next battle of divine children, I expect you to crush all other Divine Sons in ten breaths! Let these men who think themselves oh-so-noble and lofty know just how humble and cheap they really are!”

“As you command!” Shenwu Yi replied without hesitation, “I will accept any punishment from you if I fail, Mother.”

The other Divine Regents wore varying shades of ugliness on their faces. Shenwu Yanye might be rebuking Shenwu Yi, but she was also humiliating the other five Kingdoms of God at the same time. But what could they do? Out of everyone, the heavens had chosen to bless the madwoman and the isolated Eternal Night Kingdom of God.

This term’s Eternal Night Divine Daughter had undoubtedly surpassed the former number one Divine Son, Dian Jiuzhi. Naturally, she had surpassed all other Godbearers as well.

The Abyssal Monarch continued to float in the air and observe everything in silence. Forget offering advice, he did not even speak a word. His expression looked as calm as an eternal ice peak, though hidden deep within his pupils were specks of dim light no one could understand.

1. Probably the greatest defeat he could ever receive in his life. From this point onward, only hell awaits. It’s tragic. ☜
