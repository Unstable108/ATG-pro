Yun Che returned Hua Caili’s grip firmly. “Your father isn’t the one I’m afraid of. It’s... the universally known engagement between the Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter and the Boundless Divine Son; the one that was bestowed by the Abyssal Monarch Himself. If the engagement is broken... there's no avoiding dishonor.”

“Even if your father flies into an unprecedented rage, I’m alright with it. He is your father, and he deserves to be angry on your behalf. What I’m afraid of is that I would hurt you even after I did my best.”

Hua Caili shook her head. “So long as my father gives us his permission, I am willing to endure any pain. I would not be afraid even if I was loathed, ridiculed, and scorned by everyone.”

“As for my uncle, the Abyssal Monarch... I can just cry to him everyday. He’ll melt!”

Yun Che smiled but said nothing. Considering Hua Caili’s appearance and temperament, it was perfectly understandable that the Abyssal Monarch and the High Priests pampered her to her bones. However, things were completely different when two Kingdoms of God and the Abyssal Monarch’s dignity and an imperial edict were in question.

“Plus, while my father sounds like a mighty and scary Divine Regent, he's really gentle. I’ve truly never seen him get angry in my life.”

Yun Che replied, “It was said that the Heart Painter Divine Regent is as calm as a still lake, and as affable as the spring wind. Although he is a Divine Regent, he does not scorn those beneath him and has good friends all over the world.”

“Yep!” Hua Caili nodded in agreement. “Father really does have an incredible number of friends. No matter where he goes, he will be welcomed by friends from all walks of life... speaking of which, Father has two best friends. Do you know who they are?”

“Er...” Yun Che thought for a moment before answering, “According to the rumors, the Heart Painter Divine Regent, the Boundless Divine Regent, and the Dreamless Divine Regent are close friends who will die for each other if necessary.”

“That’s right!” She moved closer to Yun Che and whispered, “Do you know why that is the case?”

Before Yun Che could answer, she whispered in a quieter voice, “It’s because Boundless Divine Regent and Dreamless Divine Regent were my aunt’s most fervent admirers when they were still Divine Sons, and Father was the closest person to her. They wanted to get closer to my aunt, which is why they did everything in their power to curry favor with my father. Naturally, they share a good relationship... hehehe.”

She hid a giggle behind her hand.

High up in the sky, Hua Qingying’s eyes were silent. She pretended that she couldn’t hear Hua Caili’s whispers.

Yun Che carefully snuck a glance at the sky above their heads before lowering his voice as well, “I heard that there were three Divine Sons who pursued you-know-who back then. Pray Eternal Divine Regent of the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God... didn’t he try to curry favor with your Father?”

Hua Caili replied without thinking, “According to Father, Pray Eternal Divine Regent was utterly devastated by my aunt back when they shared the same cultivation level. Since then, he completely lost any desire to woo her. Even after he became a Divine Regent... he could not help but act weird whenever she was around.”

It was at this moment that the aura of a Half-God rapidly closed in on them from up ahead.

Yun Che immediately released Hua Caili’s hand and fell in behind her. He whispered, “Remember our promise, Caili. We don’t want to put your father in a difficult position before we’re ready to face everything.”

“I understand.” Hua Caili exhaled lightly as determination slowly solidified in her eyes.

The owner of the aura quickly entered their vision. She was a fairy-like woman wearing a white dress.

The denizens of the Abyss were tormented by abyssal dust since the moment they were born. That was why most of them had rough and dark-colored countenance. On the other hand, the people of this Kingdom of God looked like divine beings who lived in the celestial realms. The difference between their appearance was like night and day.

The woman before them would be exceedingly gorgeous even back in Yun Che’s world; a one-in-ten-thousand beauty who could topple nations with just her appearance.

It was too bad her radiance was almost non-descript before the angel that was Hua Caili.

“Elder sister!”

At first, the woman could only stare at Hua Caili with dumb disbelief. Then, she let out a joyful cry and pounced toward her.

“Lianzhi!” Hua Caili too broke into a happy smile. “I’m home.”

Upon reaching Hua Caili, Hua Lianzhi looked her up and down again, and again, and again. She just couldn’t believe her senses even though she knew she they weren’t lying to her. “Elder sister, how in the world... are you in the Divine Extinction Realm already? Heavens! A nineteen-year-old Half-God! Forget the Kingdoms of God, even the Pure Land would be shaken by your achievement for a long time to come!”

“Ah!” She suddenly recalled something and hurriedly bowed to the sky. “Lianzhi greets aunt. Sorry for almost forgetting my manners, I'm just too excited.”

No one answered her, but Hua Lianzhi was clearly used to this. She took the silence as an answer and grabbed Hua Caili’s hand immediately. “Let’s meet Father already, elder sister. I’m sure he’ll be overjoyed when he learns about this.”

“Ah... please give me a moment.” Hua Caili stopped in her tracks and turned around to look at Yun Che. “Big brother Yun, let’s go. I’ll take you to the sword pavilion first.”

Hua Lianzhi’s attention had been on Hua Caili this whole time. It was only now that she examined Yun Che seriously.

One look was all it took to cause her to lose herself in his countenance for a long while, eyes rippling with uneven, irregular waves.

There was no doubt that Yun Che’s appearance was exceedingly attractive to the women of the Abyss. After all, even Hua Caili had drowned in it.

Although his aura was that of a level three Divine Master only, one look at his face was all anyone needed to see to know that he was of noble birth.

Hua Lianzhi spoke up first, “I am Lianzhi, elder sister’s two thousand, three hundred, and seventy-third younger sister. I am also her sword attendant. I apologize for my lack of propriety. May I know your name, young master?”

Her sword-marked eyes never left Yun Che’s face as she spoke. She herself did not realize that she was attracted to him.

Hua Caili subtly shifted sideways and blocked Yun Che from Hua Lianzhi’s view. “Big brother Yun’s name is Yun Che. I brought him to the Kingdom of God because he did me a great favor during my trial.”

A level three Divine Master... who did my Half-God elder sister a great favor?

And... Yun? What is this surname?

Forget the Six Kingdoms of God, she could not remember a single notable faction with the surname Yun.

Despite her doubts, Hua Lianzhi did not pry. She nodded. “A benefactor of my elder sister is my benefactor as well. Welcome to the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God, young master Yun. If you need anything, please do not hesitate to speak with m—”

“It’s fine!” Hua Caili hurriedly cut her off with a wary look in her eyes. “You are a busy woman, Lianzhi. We wouldn’t want to trouble you with trivialities. I’m the one who brought big brother Yun home, so I’ll take care of him myself.”

“...” Hua Lianzhi’s mouth opened, but she didn’t know what to say. She was astonished.

It was at this moment the abyssal dust high above the sky parted all of a sudden.

“You’re back, Caili.”

It was an exceptionally gentle voice. Three words, and yet it felt like an immortal fog or a clear wind that soothed the soul.

The space in front of them distorted slightly, and a white silhouette entered into view.

He was wearing a plain white robe with his long hair tied up in a simple manner. His face was handsome and clean, possessing both the youthfulness of a youngster and the refinement of a middle-aged man. The one thing he should possess—the infinite might and dignity of a Divine Regent—was nowhere to be found.

For someone who didn’t know better, they would think that he was just a frail and sheltered noble young master.

If Hua Caili hadn’t called him “Father”, Yun Che himself wouldn’t have believed that he was the Heart Painter Divine Regent, the absolute ruler of the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God, Hua Fuchen!

Although Hua Caili was afraid and worried for good reason, her longing for her Father still exceeded her negative emotions in an instant. With a cry, she rushed forward to hug her father... only to be stopped by a wall of gentle profound energy as soon as she took half a step.

“How many times have I told you that a good daughter should stay a respectful distance from her father? Are you three?”

Hua Fuchen beamed at her; the divine eyes that seemed to be hiding a sea of stars radiating so much joy and concern they almost spilled out into the open.

He was the Divine Regent of a Kingdom of God, and he actually stepped out of his kingdom’s barrier to welcome Hua Caili in person. It did not take a genius to see just how much he spoiled her.

“Yes yes yes,” Hua Caili pouted a little. “And you act like an old fogey even though you’re still so young.”

“Hahahaha.” Hua Fuchen let out a refreshing laugh before stepping forward and patted her on the head, sighing. “It was your aunt who insisted that you go on this trial. I would’ve been happy if the trial improved your understanding of the world slightly, but to think that you experienced a major breakthrough and ripped the history of the Abyss to shreds!”

He exclaimed in astonishment, delight, and a hint of something more complex and indiscernible. “Your aunt even told me that you have grasped the First Sword of the Ninety Nine Heaven Breaking Swords? To say that your achievements surpassed mine completely would be an understatement. I am most proud of you, daughter.”

“However, I’m starting to think that Dian Jiuzhi is getting away with murder. I’m going to have to shake down Dian Rahu a little and increase the number of betrothal gifts, hahahaha.”

Hua Caili’s smile disappeared, and she snuck a nervous glance at Yun Che. Then, she said in a hurry, “Father, allow me to make the introductions.”

“He is Yun... Che, my benefactor during this trial. He has never entered a Kingdom of God before, so I brought him home with me.”

Hua Fuchen was no ordinary character.

He was also the person who understood his daughter the most.

As a result, Hua Caili’s unnatural expression when he spoke about Dian Jiuzhi, the flash of nervousness, the way her voice completely changed when she spoke of Yun Che, and the way her eyes shone naturally like dazzling stars when she looked at him...

He could feel everything.

His eyebrows furrowed imperceptibly.

Yun Che stepped forward and saluted him respectfully. “Junior Yun Che greets the Heart Painter Divine Regent. It is my greatest honor to meet you.”

“Yun Che? Mm.” Hua Fuchen nodded smilingly with no discernible emotion. “Since you are Caili’s benefactor, my Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God will repay the favor a hundred fold.”

“Lianzhi, please attend to him personally. Caili, I shall take you to—”

“Oh! Nonono!” Hua Caili hurriedly rejected whatever he was going to say and took a half step toward Yun Che. “Big brother Yun is my benefactor! I must see to him myself!”

“Not now, dear.” Hua Fuchen continued to smile elegantly like an exasperated father trying to persuade a naughty daughter to see reason. “Lianzhi, take him to the guest region.”

Yun Che neither moved nor said anything. It was because now was not the time to speak. 𝐟𝗿𝐞𝚎𝚠𝐞𝚋𝕟𝐨𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝕔𝕠𝚖

Hua Caili wouldn’t allow Yun Che to leave her watchful eye, of course. She moved closer to Yun Che again and was about to say something when a blue flash appeared. It was Hua Qingying standing beside her.

“Caili,” she said indifferently, “take Yun Che back to your bed—your sword pavilion first.”

“...” For the first time, Hua Fuchen’s impeccable mask cracked slightly.

As if hearing the melody of heaven, Hua Caili responded immediately, “Got it, Aunt!”

“Let’s go, big brother Yun! Father... I’ll see you in a bit.”

Yun Che performed a stiff, proper salute before following behind Hua Caili. There was no doubt that the best person to confess to Hua Fuchen wasn’t Hua Caili, and definitely not him. It was the one who witnessed and acquiesced to everything—one might even say that she was the one who facilitated everything—Hua Qingying.

Hua Lianzhi looked a bit lost, but she eventually bade Hua Fuchen and Hua Qingying goodbye before following before Hua Caili as well.

“What’s going on?”

With only Hua Qingying by his side, Hua Fuchen finally did not need to withhold his emotions any longer, “Who is that boy, Yun Che? What... is his relationship with Caili?”

Hua Qingying did not waste her breath. She simply took off toward the barrier while saying, “We’ll speak back at your place.”

Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God, the Yixin Sword Pavilion that belonged to the Heart Painted Divine Regent only.

Hua Fuchen was about to ask his question after sending everyone away when Hua Qingying’s first words struck him like a lightning bolt.

“Caili and Yun Che are very much like you and Wanxin back then.”

Hua Fuchen’s mind turned blank, and he swallowed the words he was about to say like they were a million rocks. After taking a moment to master himself, he forced himself to ask, “What... do you mean by that, Qingying?”

“It is exactly what you think it is.”

Hua Qingying’s response was indifferent and emotionless. She had had months to come to terms with everything after all. “Caili and Yun Che love each other.”

“Ridiculous! Just... ridiculous!”

The last time Hua Fuchen lost his composure like this was several thousand years ago, but Hua Qingying wasn’t surprised in the slightest. At this time, the one thing that could cause him to lose his composure like this was probably Hua Caili.

“Caili and Dian Jiuzhi are engaged! It was bestowed by the Abyssal Monarch Himself and known to all! How could she... how could she...”

Hua Fuchen’s eyebrows were furrowed like sharp swords, and his eyes were clearly smoldering with great emotions. Still, he could not bear to scold his own daughter and so shifted his ire to a certain young man, “How dare that boy, Yun Che, do such a thing!”

He abruptly rose to his feet, the sliver of profound energy he could not control because of his raging emotions causing the ground to shake. “Caili’s trial... her relationship with that boy could not have lasted longer than a year. It is not too late yet. Exile that boy now, the farther away the better. Separate them forever so that Caili will not even think that there is hope for them to be together again.”

Hua Qingying spoke again, “Caili has given herself to Yun Che.”

For a moment, there was only deathly silence. Hua Fuchen suddenly froze like someone had nailed him to the floor.

A good few breaths later, he finally turned around to face Hua Qingying directly. His expression was so stiff one almost couldn’t believe that it was the face of a man. “What... did you just say?”

It wasn’t anger or shock... It was the True God of a Kingdom of God seriously doubting his own ears.

“You heard me correctly.” A cold voice ripped the Heart Painter Divine Regent’s almost pitiful self-doubt into tiny, irreversible pieces. “She gave herself to Yun Che a few months ago. Their love is only growing stronger by the day, and they have sworn the rest of their lives and deaths to each other.”

Long Arse Author’s Notes:

Let’s talk about Shenwu Yi.

We now have a second person who can use abyssal dust. I can reveal that her control over abyssal dust is way weaker than Yun Che’s, about one millionth of late-game Yun Che I guess.

If I were to give an example, Yun Che can engulf an entire city with the wave of a hand, whereas Shenwu Yi can barely fill a small room. Still, she possesses the abilities to exploit this to the max.

As for why she can use it, and why her mastery is so much weaker than Yun Che’s... I leave it to your imagination.

As for who Shenwu Yi was before she lost her memories.. I don’t know either. After all, I’m just a soulless typist who doesn’t understand the plot, right?
