Hua Fuchen did not say anything else. He took his leave, leaving behind a terrified and panicking Hua Caili.

“Are… are you really going to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God, big brother Yun?”

She looked at Yun Che with fearful and worried eyes while shaking her head, “No, no! This is unacceptable! The Dreamweaver Kingdom of God is a most dangerous place. Everyone there is an expert in soul energy and can easily trap someone in an illusion. You can’t go there! You just can’t!”

“I’ll seek aunt out right away. There must be a way to change this.”

Hua Caili was just turning around when Yun Che gently pulled her back to his side. “Caili, I already promised your Father. I cannot go back on my word.”

“But…” Hua Caili’s eyes brimmed with tears.

She was a girl who was allowed to play and fool around to her heart’s content in the Pure Land. In the past, she would never associate the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God with the word “fear.” When she realized that Yun Che must head there alone and survive there for five years though, the dark storm of fear immediately shrouded her senses.

Yun Che shook his head without any worry whatsoever. “To tell you the truth, this trial completely exceeded my expectations. Considering his identity, status and standpoint, he could’ve given me a trial a hundred times more difficult than this, and it would only be proper.”

“Do you remember what I told you before, Caili?” Yun Che lifted one hand and cupped her cheek gently. “The things your Father must weigh and endure far exceed ours. I have nothing—absolutely nothing—besides my love for you. The fact that your Father is willing to compromise to this extent for our sake… From my perspective at least, it is a kindness I dared not even think of prior to entering the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God.”

“Five years. Your Father isn’t trying to test if our relationship will cool during the five years we are apart. No, he is testing to see if I can set foot on or even carve out a foothold in a Kingdom of God just with my capabilities.”

“To me at least, this trial couldn't be any kinder. After all, it is something I would have had to prove eventually. If I can't even do this much… how can I deserve to be together with my Rainbow Glass Divine Daughter?”

Hua Caili shook her head. “I don’t need any proof. All I need is for you to be safe and sound.”

“But I do,” Yun Che said gently. “I will never allow my Caili to be laughed at or looked down upon because of me.”

Hua Caili blinked and confessed, “I knew… you would say that.”

“Five years is a short but curious period.”

“What… do you mean?” Hua Caili murmured.

Yun Che smiled. “I remember you mentioning that the Six Kingdoms of God and the Dragon Race would be heading to the Pure Land and meeting with the Abyssal Monarch in three years. The reason your Father wishes to separate us before then is to mitigate any potential risk of exposure. No matter how good our cover is, someone will suspect something if we are together for three years straight. Should the worst happen, the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God will be facing immense pressure not just from the Pure Land or the Boundless Kingdom of God, but internally as well. No matter how powerful your Father is, it will be difficult to handle all that pressure, am I right? Not to mention the Pure Land Meet.”

“My trip to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God is not just a trial to you and I, but also protection. Personally, I choose to believe that your Father—the man who loves you more than his own life—needs these five years to think, weigh his options, and prepare for the inevitable. He needs time to prepare the best possible countermeasures.”

“One more thing. You once told me that the Dreamless Divine Regent and Boundless Divine Regent are your Father’s best friends. Therefore, your Father may have decided to send me to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God… to prepare for our future.”

Hua Caili watched him blankly, the fear and worry in her heart slowly but surely evaporating like fading mist.

“Okay…” She leaned forward and hugged Yun Che with almost all her might. It looked like she wanted to mold him into her, or herself into him. “Five years… I’ll wait for you, you must…. No, I’m sure you will complete your trial ten times, no, a hundred times above expectations. I’m sure you will be safe and sound… better… stronger… uu… uuu… uuuuuuu…”

Her pleas turned into sobs, and in the end, she couldn’t even say a word anymore. All the time, her shoulders kept shaking harder and harder.

The Heart Painter Divine Regent heard their conversation perfectly as a matter of course.

“This boy…” Hua Fuchen murmured to himself. For an instant, his eyes actually turned misty as well.

“Did you send him to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God to have someone cast ‘Falling Dream’ on him?”

Hua Qingying’s voice suddenly entered his ears. The woman slowly appeared next to him right after.

“That’s right,” Hua Fuchen admitted without any hesitation, “I don’t care what you think of me, but I must confirm his sincerity no matter what. Otherwise… he doesn’t deserve my compromise.”

Hua Qingying frowned a little. “I am the witness of his sincerity. Do you really think he can conceal his true self from my perception?”

“Qingying, you are the person I trust the most in this world. Of course I believe you with all my heart.” Hua Fuchen sighed. “However, my trust in the human heart is a different story.”

Hua Qingying replied indifferently, “I have no qualms with your desire to test his sincerity, but ‘Falling Dream’... reveals all secrets. If any one of his secrets were to be exposed, especially that master about his, then…”

“Don’t worry,” Hua Fuchen gave her a reassuring smile, “I asked Meng Kongchan to perform the art himself.”

Hua Qingying relaxed. She no longer had any objections.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

A small, delicate, profound ark stopped in front of Yun Che. Its aura was pretty weak.

“Father,” Hua Caili was gripping Yun Che’s hand tightly, fingers fully interlocked with one another. “At least…. At least allow me to escort big brother Yun to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God.”

Her eyes were teary, and she was begging her heart out with everything she learned since she was a baby. However, Hua Fuchen looked away from her and replied stiffly, “Unacceptable!”

He had full control of the variables while the duo were still within the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God, but if they were to appear in the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God together… The risk of exposure was simply too great.

“Father, big brother Yun has never been to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God before. He has no idea how to get there on his own. This profound ark also requires sword qi to pilot, and considering big brother Yun’s style, he will surely have trouble piloting it. The chances he might encounter an accident on the way are too great… Father, I promise I will return immediately after I take him to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God. I promise I won’t delay even a moment. Please?”

Hua Fuchen still refused to look at his daughter’s face. He was afraid he would crumble if he met her pitiful eyes.

“Caili’s argument makes sense.” Hua Qingying chose this moment to speak up. “I will escort Yun Che to his destination myself.”

Overjoyed, Hua Caili nodded strongly. “Okay! Thank you, aunt!”

“Hmph!” Hua Fuchen harrumphed through his nose, but he ultimately did not say anything.

With Hua Qingying acting as his escort, Hua Caili’s heart finally settled a little. She looked at Yun Che, eyes drinking in his figure from top to bottom. Although she had long since engraved his image into her soul, she still couldn’t help but watch him with deep yearning, eyes unwilling to stray for even an instant.

“Remember what I told you, big brother Yun. Don’t start any conflicts, and don’t do anything dangerous once you’re at the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God. You must, must protect yourself…”

“It really, really doesn’t matter if you ‘carve out a foothold for yourself’ or not. You must never forget that your safety is more important than anything…”

“Don’t get closer to Meng Jianxi, and don’t get close to that place they call the ‘Sinking Dream Valley.’ Don’t look into anyone’s eyes for too long…”

“If possible, find a cultivation barrier and stay in there for five years. Don’t go anywhere, and don’t interact with anyone…”

“I know. I'll remember it all.” Yun Che listened to her advice seriously from start to finish before saying, “I’m no longer just carrying my own fate. I am carrying both our futures on my shoulders. That is why I will absolutely, absolutely , keep myself safe. I promise you that you won’t find even a hair out of place when five years have passed, and I have returned to your side.”

“...” Hua Fuchen facepalmed. “It’s just five years, and they make it sound like it’s the last time they'll ever see each other.”

Hua Qingying said, “Five years is but a flash to you and I, but Caili is less than twenty despite being born over ten thousand years ago. Besides, now is the time her feelings for Yun Che burn the brightest. To her, five years might as well be an infinity where every second is suffering.”

“Sigh.” Hua Fuchen shook his head helplessly. “You spoil her rotten.”

It was at this moment a round orb suddenly appeared in Yun Che’s hand. It was filled with countless purple stars that floated around like purple butterflies of the night. “Five years is one thousand, eight hundred, and twenty five days, and I have engraved just as many Soul Butterflies in this orb. Each and every Soul Butterfly is engraved with the words I have prepared solely for you. Whenever you miss me, just release a Soul Butterfly, and you will hear my heart and voice. It will be as if I am by your side.”

He then held up the longevity beads Hua Caili had given and touched the soul glow belonging to Hua Caili with his fingers. “Just the same, with your longevity beads by my side, I can touch your soul whenever I want to. It will be as if you are by my side every second, every moment. Five years may be long, but I am not afraid, for I know that I am not alone. If at some point you feel a sudden warmth in your soul, know that it must be me missing you, my Caili…”

“~!@#￥%...” Hua Fuchen’s fingers dug deeper into his face. He only wished he could rip off his face right now.

How the hell did that bastard muster the courage to say such embarrassing words? And to his daughter no less!

“Time’s up. Get lost!” Unable to stand this any longer, Hua Fuchen waved his hand and growled in a way that was unbefitting of a ruler.

Hua Qingying blurred and reappeared on the profound ark. She waved her hand, and a gust of clear wind carried Yun Che to the profound ark as well.

“Let’s go.”

With that simple remark, Hua Qingying mustered her sword qi and lifted the profound ark into the air. It couldn’t be helped. If she didn’t act decisively, Hua Qingying was fairly certain that Hua Caili could cling to Yun Che’s hand until tomorrow.

“Big brother Yun!!”

The profound ark was many kilometers away in just the blink of an eye. Even so, he could hear her cries:

“Big brother Yun… you must protect yourself…”

“You can’t forget to think about me… not even for one day…”

“I’ll wait right here. I won’t go anywhere…”

“I won’t get nearer to any man… I won’t call anyone big brother except you…”

“Remember your promise, big brother Yun… our future…”

The young woman’s voice grew increasingly distant and weak. The sobs were growing more and more uncontrollable as well.

“...” Right after the voice had fully disappeared, Yun Che ultimately could not stop himself from looking back.

It only lasted an instant though. He ripped his gaze away immediately after.

Hua Caili was chasing after the profound ark until she slammed against a barrier. She fell to the ground, but she did not get up. She simply stared at the small profound ark blankly as it disappeared bit by bit. Eventually, it was completely gone.

It felt like her world had been emptied as well.

Her fingers could no longer brush his skin. His warm eyes would no longer touch hers.

An unknown amount of time later, she finally climbed to her feet. She was biting her lips hard to keep herself from crying, but the water in her eyes couldn’t be dispelled no matter what she tried.

Hua Fuchen simply watched while feeling a kaleidoscope of emotions.

It was at this moment Hua Caili turned around to face him.

The tears watering her eyes and staining her flawless skin were enough to shatter anyone’s heart.

Even worse, it was like the color had been completely sucked out of her eyes. The countless stars residing in her pupils had vanished with Yun Che’s departure as well.

“Father,” she spoke up a bit raspily, “I want to enter the Seven Stars Heaven Breaker Formation!”

Her request was short, but Hua Fuchen’s heart skipped a beat.

It was because he could feel a kind of determination he never felt from Hua Caili before.

He looked into her eyes and said slowly, “Once you've entered the Seven Star Heaven Breaker Formation, you may not leave until you overcome the Seven Sword Sovereigns’ trials… Are you sure about this?”

Each Heaven Breaker Sword Sovereign represented the pinnacle of a way of the sword.

Hua Caili whispered as if she was in a trance, “Big brother Yun is not a rootless duckweed. He is the radiance that illuminates the world, free and outstanding. But for me, he came to the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God. For me, he is once again forced to depart to a lofty and unfamiliar place he knows nothing about.”

“He should not be the only person to bear our future.”

“...” Very, very slowly, Hua Fuchen nodded and approved of the cruel determination behind his daughter’s words. “Very well.”

“He… actually sent you to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God just as you said he would.”

Li Suo muttered to herself.

When Hua Fuchen mentioned his final trial, Hua Caii had reacted the worst out of everyone, but it was more worry for Yun Che’s safety and fear toward separation. Li Suo was the one who was most shocked out of all of them.

“What, you thought I was making things up?” Yun Che asked.

Li Suo replied, “I am… quite surprised. I just can not understand how you were able to identify Hua Fuchen’s determination so accurately, and from so long ago.”

Yun Che narrowed his eyes a little. “To tell you the truth, this was way easier than I thought it would be.”

“Did you realize something, Li Suo? Although the people of the Kingdoms of God possess power far beyond that of the God Realm, they also seem to be far more…” Yun Che thought long and hard before landing on a word that caused his face to scrunch up a little. “... innocent .”

“Innocent?” Li Suo repeated in confusion.

“Let me put it another way.” Yun Che began, “If Caili’s father was someone like Xing Juekong or Qianye Fantian, how much harder do you think it would be for me to succeed?”

“Oh. Oops.” Yun Che came to a realization as soon as he finished his question. “Apologies. I forgot that Xing Juekong was crippled, and Qianye Fantian was dead by the time you ‘fell’ into my hands. You aren’t familiar with them at all.”
