"Hmm? Wuming Divine Venerable¹... wants to kill me?"

Yun Che's face showed surprise, six parts bewilderment, and four parts shock.

But after a moment's thought, he roughly understood the reason. Not only did he show no fear, but he even curved his lips into a faint smile. "Thank you for the reminder, Elder Brother². I will be careful."

To remain so unperturbed by a Divine Venerable's murderous intent, despite only being a Divine Master, Mo Su³ slightly lowered his gaze. "You're not afraid?"

"What good would fear do? What good would not fearing do?"

Yun Che's demeanor exuded a composure entirely unbefitting his cultivation. He spoke with a carefree arrogance, "Shen Wuyan Ye⁴, in the end, is merely a pathetic woman who lost her heart to love. In my eyes, she's no different in essence from the Soulless Abyss Ghosts⁵ in the Mist Sea."

"I can enter and exit the Mist Sea, where countless Abyss Ghosts roam, alone and repeatedly. Why should I fear a woman who has lost her mind?"

Mo Su smiled and shook his head. "I have been the Abyss Emperor for so many years, witnessing the rise and fall of generations of Divine Venerables. Never before has anyone spoken of a Divine Venerable of a Divine Kingdom in such terms."

"That's because the world before didn't have a person like me."

This short sentence, while carefree, fully unleashed an untamed arrogance.

The Abyss Emperor's smile grew wider, seemingly with a hint of delight. "Looking at your demeanor, it seems you don't need me to interfere in this matter either."

Yun Che didn't answer directly. Instead, he asked a rather serious question, "May I ask, Elder Brother Mo Su, in your understanding, would Elder Brother Ni Xuan⁶ choose to act cautiously and seek shelter under others' protection when faced with a threat?"

Mo Su answered without hesitation, "He absolutely would not."

"Therefore, Elder Brother should also know my answer."

Mo Su gazed at Yun Che again, then once more let out the same sigh of admiration. "You and Elder Brother Ni Xuan are truly too alike."

Dugu Zhuyuan⁷ bowed his head deeply, desperately concealing the surging shock in his eyes.

He had never heard the Abyss Emperor speak so much, nor had he ever seen him smile like this.

"It's common knowledge that Wuming Divine Venerable intensely dislikes men, yet she remains respectful in front of Elder Brother. This shows that even though she has lost her heart, she hasn't completely lost her mind. Given this, as Wuming Divine Venerable, she wouldn't personally make a move against me."

"And with my identity, to kill me would not only require getting past the Weaving Dream Divine Kingdom⁸, but also finding the right time and place to leave as few traces as possible..."

At this point, Yun Che's eyes suddenly narrowed for a moment.

He thought of a place...

The Divine Slumber Forbidden Zone⁹!

His expression unchanged, he continued, "And by the time the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom¹⁰ finally finds this so-called 'right time and place,' Wuming Divine Venerable's murderous intent, born from a momentary stimulus, might have already faded."

Mo Su nodded slightly. "Indeed. Though you are still young, your discernment of people already far surpasses your peers. However, between heaven and earth, endless variables exist every moment, and people's thoughts change constantly. Even standing at the highest point, one cannot truly grasp the whole picture or fully understand people's hearts. Are you not afraid of accidents, not afraid of 'what if'?"

Yun Che merely smiled, completely unafraid. "If one is constantly wary and anxious, always cautious and meticulous, then life in this world would be far too unfree. Even if I were to meet with misfortune tomorrow, for whatever reason, that would be my destined fate. Elder Brother would only need to burn a stick of incense for me and feel a little sadness. Do not grieve in your heart, and do not seek revenge for me. Just let me depart freely, without worries or attachments."

The Abyss Emperor stared fixedly at Yun Che. He knew that Yun Che was trying to offer him comfort in his own way.

Back then, when he and Ni Xuan traveled the mortal world together, Ni Xuan had said similar words, and even their expressions when they spoke them were so alike.

At that time, he had endlessly envied Ni Xuan's carefree and untamed spirit, and he still did now.

But... he could not, he was not worthy.

"I understand." He looked at "Ni Xuan" and smiled, nodding. "I had originally decided to have Dugu Zhuyuan accompany you to protect you. Now that I think about it, that would instead be a restraint on you. It was indeed my oversight."

Dugu Zhuyuan: "?"

Yun Che didn't stand on ceremony with him at all, immediately saying, "No, no, no, please don't! That's more than just a restraint; it's like putting a shining cangue¹¹ on my head!"

Dugu Zhuyuan: "???"

"Oh! Speaking of which..." Yun Che seemed to have thought of something extremely important, his tone suddenly shifting, his words urgent. "Immediately, right now, remove your divine sense from me! Not a single trace is allowed to remain!"

From the moment he stepped into the Pure Land, he had been under the Abyss Emperor's gaze — because of the Heretic God's Profound Veins¹² on him, or more precisely, Ni Xuan's aura.

Not to mention the subsequent Desolate Devouring Punishment¹³, Mo Su's intervention to stop Hua Cairi's¹⁴ sword, preventing her from severely injuring herself, was also because he had already "peeped" into their private affairs.

"Alright," Mo Su agreed. "Don't worry, since you call me Elder Brother, I naturally won't peep at you anymore."

"You know that's peeping!"

Yun Che's words didn't hide his resentment. He leaned closer, his face serious. "Elder Brother, you are the Abyss Emperor! Once you make a promise, you absolutely cannot go back on your word! You are never allowed to secretly peep again! What if my Cairi and I are in a moment of passion... my woman, even Elder Brother is absolutely not allowed to stare!"

Even Dugu Zhuyuan vaguely saw two black lines¹⁵ seemingly appear on the Abyss Emperor's forehead.

"How could I be such a person?"

The Abyss Emperor, who had not known the meaning of "argument" for countless years, uttered this bland rebuttal with a hint of difficulty.

After speaking, he realized his momentum was lacking and he truly didn't have the demeanor of an elder brother. He immediately shook his head and smiled, "Zhuyuan, escort Yun Che back."

As they parted, Mo Su gave him one last warning: "Yun Che, remember not to enter the Mist Sea. That is the only place I cannot control."

"Of course. Now that I know of the 'Mist Emperor's' existence, how could I dare to take another step in?"

Yun Che followed Dugu Zhuyuan and left.

Mo Su watched him depart, standing silently for a long time.

Until Yun Che's figure descended below the Eden Cloud Summit¹⁶, he slightly raised his head, a soft sigh dissipating into the clear breeze.

"Elder Brother Ni Xuan... even if the world breaks apart, and the ages turn, you still think of me, sending another you into my world."

"To have met you and Xiao Die¹⁷ in this life, despite endless sorrow and endless soul-shattering pain, is still such a blessing."

Leaving the Eden Cloud Summit, Yun Che still maintained a relaxed and comfortable expression, his eyes not forgetting to scan the unique scenery of the Pure Land. In reality, the heavy pressure in his heart had quietly faded, replaced by a lingering gloom that refused to disperse.

Dugu Zhuyuan quietly guarded in front. Although his heart was filled with endless astonishment, he maintained the posture of a knight, never asking an extra word.

Li Sa¹⁸ asked, "You are no longer directly facing the Abyss Emperor. Why is your mood still so heavy? Are you afraid his divine sense is still following you?"

"No," Yun Che's voice was calm. "Since he has promised, he will certainly not peep at me again."

He paused, his tone grave. "Li Sa, do you still remember what the Qilin God¹⁹ said before it dissipated in the Qilin God Ancient Realm²⁰? It said: 'The Abyss is destined to collapse. His obsession is the most terrifying thing in this world, something no one can reverse.'"

"Today, facing the Abyss Emperor myself, I realize how terrifying he is, far exceeding my expectations... one could even say it has surpassed the limits of what I could once imagine."

"Terri...fying?" Li Sa murmured, seemingly confused. "But he only showed kindness and trust towards you. Moreover, I don't sense any malice from him."

Yun Che didn't refute Li Sa's words but agreed, "Of course you don't perceive his malice, because he is not an evil person."

"But there is a type of person who is far more terrifying than an evil person... far more terrifying."

Li Sa couldn't understand this sentence. "What... do you mean?"

Yun Che slowly said, "You think he has a special trust in me. But in reality, he doesn't have concepts like 'trust' or 'distrust' for me. Think back carefully to my conversation with him — for anything I said, he never once sought to verify its truth, not a single word. The occasional probe or two was only to look for Ni Xuan's shadow in me."

Li Sa was silent for a moment.

"In other words, he only cares about Ni Xuan's aura on me and my identity as Ni Xuan's successor. As for whether what I say is true or false, he doesn't care at all."

"Simply because... as he himself said, his life now only has one thing left, allowing for nothing else. This is precisely what makes him most terrifying."

Yun Che's voice softened, each word striking the heart. "An evil person doing evil still needs to weigh the pros and cons. But such an extremely pure obsession has completely transcended the common understanding of good and evil, right and wrong. For any possibility, any price can be paid, any obstacle will be annihilated without hesitation... nothing can stop it, no path to retreat, no thought can disturb, no emotion can shift it."

"Ah..." Li Sa seemed to understand, but what followed was confusion about such pure obsession. "I still can't understand why he would be so obsessed with one person. As an emperor of the same world, why doesn't he choose to have a harem of empresses and nine demonesses like you...?"

"Cough, cough, cough!" Yun Che forcefully stopped her words, saying with utmost seriousness, "My situation and his are vastly different! How can they be compared!"

"How are they different?" Li Sa pressed. "Because Pan Xiao Die²¹ saved his life with her own body?"

"More than that," Yun Che said. "What Pan Xiao Die did back then, though born of extreme affection and panic, putting everything after Mo Su's safety, nevertheless, by causing the Devil Race to lose two great Devil Artifacts²², she is undoubtedly a great sinner whom the Devil Race can never forgive."

"Any devil of the Devil Race has the right to hate her, to curse her. Her maternal clan and her relatives must also have been shamed because of her. If the news spread, even outsiders would surely mock and despise her."

"This shows that Pan Xiao Die is a person of extreme temperament. Her feelings for Mo Su completely transcended 'reason' and 'correctness'."

"At the same time, Mo Su's father — the Heaven Punishing Divine Emperor Mo E²³, for the sake of 'reason' and 'correctness,' was so ruthless that he would not hesitate to use the Ancestral Sword²⁴ to execute his own son."

"The contrast and clash between these two... gave birth to the current Mo Su, whose obsession is like an endless abyss."

Li Sa pondered for a long time, once again expanding her understanding of human nature, then let out a soft sigh. "So the terror of extreme obsession can surpass extreme malice. What state is Pan Xiao Die in now?"

"Cannot ask, dare not ask," Yun Che sighed. "But one can guess that there should be a trace of vitality remaining that hasn't yet been annihilated by her will to die. And the place she is in right now... is undoubtedly that 'cradle' that Cairi mentioned."

Li Sa asked again, "But... I'm still confused. Is his obsession truly as pure and terrifying as you say? He isn't without other concerns; otherwise, how would there be the current Pure Land and the Six Great Divine Kingdoms?"

Yun Che narrowed his eyes slightly. "You've hit on the key point."

Li Sa: "...?"

"For now, Mo Su seems to believe that the only way to awaken Pan Xiao Die is in the 'Eternal Pure Land'²⁵. As for what this method is, it's not important. Because no matter what... no matter what, he absolutely cannot be allowed to step into the God Realm²⁶."

"To go to the 'Eternal Pure Land' requires the spatial power of the Panming Void-Breaking Mirror²⁷. And to activate the Panming Void-Breaking Mirror, the power of the Six Great Divine Kingdoms must be gathered — including the Abyss Crystals²⁸ accumulated by generations of the Six Great Divine Kingdoms and the divine power of the Seven True Gods²⁹. This is why he needs to maintain the existence of the Six Great Divine Kingdoms."

"With Mo Su's power, which touches the level of a Creation God³⁰, it is so..."

At first, she thought it was because Yun Che's power was too weak in this world, and since her soul was connected to Yun Che's, she naturally felt uneasy.

However, as Yun Che gradually grew stronger, and as the people Yun Che faced became increasingly powerful, this sense of unease persisted, yet it never changed.

Even upon entering the Pure Land and facing the strongest Abyss Emperor in this world, this unease did not intensify.

And after learning of the existence of the Abyss Master³¹, the quietly stirred fragments of cognition told her that this unease might be because, between heaven and earth...

there existed beings on a level superior to her.

However, she did not tell Yun Che this thought. As he said, facing the entire Abyss world alone, he truly had no spare energy to face other major variables. Telling him would undoubtedly add more pressure to his already immense burden.

She hoped this thought was merely a mistake, and even more, she hoped the Abyss Master would remain peacefully asleep and never awaken.

If only someone could help him, walk alongside him in this world, and share the fate of their homeland... that would be good.
