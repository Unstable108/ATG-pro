“Your mood is in a state of disquiet...” Li Suo warned Yun Che.

Yun Che did not deny this. “I just can't help but wonder what happened to her while she was in the Abyss.”

Li Suo sighed quietly. “I know far too little about her, but a woman of glazed glass... as I mentioned before, she did not possess the pure aura of a woman of glazed glass, despite being capable of creating the Glazed Glass Ice. At the very least, a woman of glazed glass would never exude coldness or indifference.”

“However, now is not the time to find the answer to these questions, not to mention that you lost yourself to bloodthirst for an instant just now. Did you forget that Meng Kongchan is right next to you? If not for the fact that everyone’s attention is on Shenwu Yi and Shenwu Yanye right now, there is a huge chance he would have discovered your odd emotion... This is the first time you made such a massive mistake since entering the Abyss.”

“Relax,” Yun Che said, “Even if I was found out, I know many excuses that can assuage his suspicion.”

He paused for a moment to calm himself before he stopped trying to defend himself. He admitted, “Okay, you’re right. I am acting rather... pathetic today.”

“You are not pathetic. On the contrary, you are acting more like ‘Yun Che’ instead of the ‘Emperor Yun’ you constantly caution yourself to be countless times per day.”

Li Suo’s voice was exactly as soft and ephemeral as before, and yet it had temporarily stunned Yun Che. A short while later, he shook his head and let out an involuntary chuckle.

“Your words are quite warming. I’m sure it’ll be quite effective against young and inexperienced women. It’s too bad that I’m carrying a burden that makes the mere act of being myself in this world an unforgivable sin. In the future, I will make sure to watch myself closely.”

Li Suo fell silent for a moment before speaking up once more, “There is one more thing I need to warn you about. Hua Caili has been staring at you for as long as you were staring at Shenwu Yi.”

Yun Che’s heart skipped a beat. Not good!

No matter how many times Yun Che warned himself to keep a clear head and fortify his mental defenses, he ultimately wasn’t a soulless abyssal beast. Even in this unfamiliar universe, there were always things that could create a chink in his mental armor... Xia Qingyue was one such example.

Luckily for him, Hua Caili was too simple and unsophisticated. In the Abyss, she was the easiest kind of person for him to handle.

He closed his eyes for a short while as if he was pondering something. Then, he suddenly opened his eyes, “instinctively” turned his head in Hua Caili’s direction, and “coincidentally” met her gaze. Right now, a thin, hazy layer of mist was covering Hua Caili’s pupils. It refracted her chaotic and indescribable feelings and panic. Yun Che lightly blinked at her before curving his mouth, looking away naturally, and looking in Dian Jiuzhi’s direction.

The one gaze and shallow smile were all it took to melt the tangled streams in Hua Caili’s heart and melt the icy mist shrouding her eyes. Soon, her pupils had returned to flawless stars.

Hua Qingying had been perceiving Hua Caili’s emotions this whole time. It wasn’t until now that she finally said, “The oddities displayed by Shenwu Yi are simply too stunning. Even your Father and I cannot help but feel shaken by her. It is perfectly normal that Yun Che would stare at her. There is no need to act sensitive or brood over his actions.”

The sudden exposure of her true feelings caught Hua Caili off guard and made her blush slightly. She hurriedly retorted, “I... I was not! I... I know best how big brother Yun thinks of me. I wasn’t brooding or anything! Don’t try to start something when there is none, Aunt!”

“... I guess I sensed wrongly.”

“You did!”

Beside them, Hua Fuchen shook his head with a wry smile on his face. When he caught Dian Rahu dispelling the cold plaguing Dian Jiuzhi out of the corner of his eye, that smile morphed into a hidden sigh.

As the greatest Divine Regent of the Six Kingdoms of God, Dian Rahu’s power was immense as a matter of course, not to mention that Dian Jiuzhi’s cultivation was strong. It wouldn’t take long for him to achieve a full recovery. Despite this, Dian Sansi continued to support him carefully.

It was at this moment that Dian Sansi suddenly sensed a gaze stabbing his back like a needle. It was overtly invasive and absolutely careless... because the owner of the gaze wanted him to sense it.

Dian Sansi was second only to Dian Jiuzhi among the younger generation of the Boundless Kingdom of God, so of course, he could not allow such a taunt to slide unchallenged. His eyes turned sharp as he traced the source of the gaze and looked. His gaze immediately clashed against Yun Che’s in mid-air.

Yun Che narrowed his eyes slightly, and the corners of his mouth twitched almost imperceptibly. Then, he very casually looked away from Dian Sansi.

Dian Sansi’s hands abruptly clenched tightly. It was because he could see the taunt in Yun Che’s eyes and especially the soundless words he spoke: Trash.

Dian Jiuzhi was in a fragile state right now. As a result, Dian Sansi’s sudden clenching of his fingers inflicted intense pain on him. He turned his head and asked, “What’s wrong, Sansi?”

Dian Sansi hurriedly relaxed his grip and forced a smile onto his face. “It’s nothing, I just... found it difficult... to accept. That’s all.”

He was gritting his teeth uncontrollably when he said the last few words.

Dian Jiuzhi thought that Dian Sansi could not accept the outcome of the fight and consoled him smilingly, “My skill is inferior, so I lost. That is just how it is. As for the verbal humiliation I received... This is the Lightless Divine Regent we’re talking about. There is no need to pay it any heed.”

Dian Sansi opened his mouth to explain, but this was the Pure Land; the Divine Regents and even the Abyssal Monarch were all present. He simply could not say a single word.

It was at this moment that thorny gaze stabbed his heart once more. Violence brimmed in Dian Sansi’s eyes as he glared hatefully at Yun Che.

Despite this, Yun Che showed no fear or surprise. On the contrary, the corners of his lips split even wider. The expression was soundless and wordless, but his scorn, disdain, contempt... it all poured right to the bottom of his soul.

See? I stole his fiancée, Hua Caili, and yet Dian Jiuzhi didn’t even dare to make a peep... trash!

See? People call him the number one Divine Son, but who’s the one lying on the floor like a frozen dog? Trash!

See? You know everything, and yet you didn’t dare to do anything... Trash!

Number one Divine Son, hahahaha... more like the number one coward of the Kingdoms of God! In my eyes, he’s nothing more than a laughingstock!

All you can do is rage impotently... then again, that’s precisely the kind of behavior I would expect from trash like you. Wanna know why you’re worse than a stray dog? Because a stray dog would at least bark at their enemies! You, and everyone around you, don’t!

Dian Sansi felt like fainting from sheer fury. The eye contact only lasted an instant, and yet Yun Che’s gaze was so painful, so scornful... it wasn’t even the contemptuous gaze of a person looking down on a weakling. It was a look of pity one reserved only for a pitiful, pathetic worm...

Such was Yun Che’s contempt that the hatred that had never stopped scorching his inside took nearly all of his willpower to suppress, and almost burst through his lid.

“Hmm?” Dian Rahu suddenly side-eyed Dian Sansi. His breathing had turned haggard and disorderly out of seemingly nowhere.

Dian Sansi sucked in a deep breath before bowing his head. “No one had ever dared to humiliate Brother Jiuzhi so, Father. I... I simply...”

Dian Rahu withdrew his gaze and said heavily, “A loser should have a loser’s resolve. If you find this difficult to swallow, then work hard to return this humiliation ten times over in the future. As for that madwoman from Eternal Night, you simply need to ignore her.”

Dian Sansi responded affirmatively and stopped talking. He would not lift his head for a long, long time. Throughout this time, his teeth were clenched tight as a vice.

Why... Why is this happening... even though the Boundless Kingdom of God is clearly the strongest Kingdom of God... even though Brother Jiuzhi was the former number one Divine Son despite his defeat... even though he did not do anything wrong... even though he was tolerating and enduring this unimaginable indignity for everyone’s sake... even though Yun Che and Hua Caili; Dreamweaver and Heaven Breaker were the ones in the wrong... 𝐟𝗿𝐞𝚎𝚠𝐞𝚋𝕟𝐨𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝕔𝕠𝚖

Why Brother Jiuzhi? Why are we the ones who are suffering such humiliation?

Crack... crack...

He could vaguely hear the sound of his teeth breaking under pressure.

Meanwhile, Shenwu Yi had returned to the center of the barrier. However, no one challenged her even though she waited for a long time. So, she cast her lake cold gaze at the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God group.

“I request your guidance, Dreamweaver Divine Son Meng Jianxi.”

Meng Jianxi expected this and so did not panic in the slightest. He took a step forward and declared frankly, “I have a high opinion of myself, but I’m well aware that I am absolutely no match for the Boundless Divine Son, even assuming our cultivation levels were the same. Naturally, I would only be a worse match for you, Eternal Night Divine Daughter.”

“Therefore, I will shamelessly offer my surrender.”

Meng Jianxi’s reply wasn’t surprising at all. The Exquisite Profound World that had no answer, the anomalous ice that overturned common sense... The only reasonable and not at all shameful answer to such overwhelming advantages was not to enter into a fight with Shenwu Yi in the first place.

“Hahahahaha!”

Just as expected, a shrill, horrible laugh echoed throughout Eden’s Crown. “Is this the Divine Son of the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God? A coward who doesn’t even dare to answer a challenge? Are you all seriously going to pass down your Kingdoms of God to such useless pieces of garbage?”

Meng Kongchan replied indifferently, “As expected of the Lightless Divine Regent, you are the only one who would stoop to the level of insulting a junior. Under your leadership, I am sure that your Kingdom of God will prosper, and all of your citizens will rejoice.”

Shenwu Yanye let out a cold cackle. “A Kingdom of God whose dreams are just as rotten as their reality, and a Godbearer who doesn’t even dare to answer a challenge. In the future, the only place for the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God is beneath the feet of Eternal Night! So what makes you think you have any right to criticize my Eternal Night Kingdom of God?!”

Meng Kongchan’s only response was to harrumph lightly. The provocation had failed to ruffle his feathers even a little.

Since Meng Jianxi had admitted defeat, the only Kingdom of God that hadn’t entered the battlefield yet was Heaven Breaker. Just when everyone thought that Hua Caili would make the same choice as Meng Jianxi, the beautiful, white figure of a young woman floated into the barrier and faced Shenwu Yi directly.

Hua Fuchen subconsciously raised his hand.

“Let her try.”

Hua Qingying interrupted him, “Caili’s sword is good enough to face the Exquisite Profound World.”

Hua Fuchen frowned a little until he recalled something. His eyes bloomed with barely disguised shock as he asked, “Are you saying that Caili...?”

Hua Qingying faced Hua Fuchen’s obviously shaky gaze and nodded slightly. “This was going to be her secret gift to you. She was also hoping that this trump card would win the favor of the Abyssal Monarch.”

She suddenly let out a quiet sigh and looked at the two people inside the barrier. She said in a sorrowful voice, “At the same cultivation level, she had a near one hundred percent chance to defeat Dian Jiuzhi. Who would have thought that this brilliant yet anomalous Eternal Night Divine Daughter would appear out of nowhere? There is no way Caili would get her wish now.”

“If she knows this, then why...”

Hua Fuchen cut himself off halfway because the answer had already come to him. Sighing in amusement and helplessness, he said, “She’s still a young girl after all.”

“This is our first meeting. Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter Hua Caili requests your guidance!”

Inside the barrier, the two women were roughly a hundred steps apart. They hadn’t fought yet, but everyone was already holding their breath and staring blankly at the battlefield. Even the soft wind and the thin cloud had stopped in their tracks to watch.

Shenwu Yi wore a plain outfit as black as ink. Icy mist seemed to be circling her clothes. Her fight against Dian Jiuzhi had disheveled her hair slightly and caused a few strands to hang limply beside her face, but it only made her look fairer and more gorgeous.

Her eyes resembled frozen ponds. She looked as beautiful as an immortal’s dream, but possessed no loveliness or charm whatsoever. There was only cold indifference, rejecting anything and everything. The icy, glazed glass aura slowly circulating around her gave her a sacred yet distant layer of light, making her look like a goddess of ice and snow who had descended from the nine heavens. She looked beautifully sharp and lofty.

On the other hand, Hua Caili wore a snow-white outfit that symbolized her identity as the Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter. Seven completely different sword radiances were sewn to her skirt, and they combined to form a complex yet gorgeous pattern of divinity and stars. They were Tianshu, Tianxuan, Tianji, Tianquan, Yuheng, Kaiyang, and Yaoguang.

The seven shining stars symbolized the worship of the seven Heaven Breaker Sword Sovereigns. It also implied eternal protection. When she moved, her skirt swayed naturally. It looked like a galaxy of stars was pouring toward the floor, bright and colorful.

Her countenance was famous throughout the Abyss for a long, long time. She was a priceless treasure of the heavens, everyone knew.

Her skin was fair and glossy like congealed lard. Her cheeks were slightly flushed, like the sunset glow. She looked as if neither the abyssal dust of the Endless Fog nor the ordinary dust of the mortal coil had ever touched her. Her eyebrows were curved like newly ascended new moons, and the brightest stars of the Abyss were refracted within her beautiful pupils. Above all else, she exuded the frail purity unique to a young woman.

They were both equally beautiful, though their personality and styles were utterly different. For them both to enter one’s eyesight at the same time was an unthinkable luxury no one in all Six Kingdoms of God had ever experienced... until now.

Outside the barrier, eyes went blank, expressions grew infatuated, and appearances were maintained by force... However, their overlapping breaths were so soft that they were almost inaudible, and their eyes seemed to have forgotten how to refract light. Even the holy land that was Eden’s Crown seemed to become colorless and lustreless all of a sudden.
