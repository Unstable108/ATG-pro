"Is this response to your satisfaction, Divine Son Yuan?" Her every word was like tempered ice and frost, so cold it seemed to pierce flesh and stab straight into the soul, using the most scathing language to shatter his pretense and crush his defenses. But… she still could not detect a single ripple in his eyes. She was so cold, so distant, her taunts so merciless… The sword in her hand was even pressed against his vulnerable throat.

Why, then, were his eyes still so warm? So warm they seemed to reflect directly into the depths of her soul. In her heart, it felt as if something was silently melting. Time and again she grew vigilant, time and again she suppressed it, but in a mere instant, that unprecedented stirring of her heart and soul would wash over her again… like an instinct hidden in the depths of her soul, suddenly awakened by his gaze—something she could neither comprehend nor stop. She had awakened in the Eternal Night God Kingdom, and her earliest memory of this world was of Shenwu Yeye. She had long grown accustomed to cold silence and suppression, yet her life was not without warmth… Shenwu Youluan and Shenwu Mingque, her two aunts, had always treated her with gentleness. It was partly out of affection for her, but more so because it was their nature.

As she journeyed through this world, she gradually discovered what made her different. Her five senses seemed to possess a sharpness that defied common sense. Her eyes, it seemed, could peer directly into a person's heart and "see" emotions hidden from others. But… she had never seen eyes like Yun Che's. She never knew a pair of eyes could hold such complex, such profound emotions… like finding what was lost after a parting of life and death; like a lonely star in the cold night finally plunging into a warm river of stars; like an ancient mirror, sealed for a thousand years, suddenly reflecting a familiar face… The emotions churning in the depths of his eyes were too thick, so thick they seemed unable to dissolve the bone-deep longing from when he had lost her, nor could they contain the trembling ecstasy of their reunion.

Ever since they met in this gray, forbidden domain, he had gazed at her with this same infatuation. His black eyes were as deep as an ink-black abyss, yet they shone brightly, as if hiding two clusters of undying starlight. Within that starlight, there was a cautious probing, as if fearing everything before him was merely a reflection in the water or a flower in the mirror¹; there was a lost, dazed trance, as if he had yet to recover from a long-lasting soul-wound and obsession. And there was an attachment so profound he would not let go even if it meant pouring out all the mountains and seas…

Who… who was he…? And who… was I…?

"Qingyue, you don't need to test me anymore. In this entire world, I am the one person you never need to test or guard against, because I… could never, ever hurt you again." His voice was as gentle as the wind, and his gaze clung to her, as if trying to bind her figure firmly within his soul.

As his words fell, he suddenly clutched his chest and began to cough violently. Each spasm brought forth a great mist of blood. The tip of the sword at his throat instantly pulled back a few fractions… The movement of her hand preceded her conscious thought, a seemingly subconscious instinct. Several streams of profound energy circulated slowly through Yun Che's body, finally stabilizing his injuries somewhat.

Shen Wuyi watched with narrowed eyes, her words still cold and mocking: "So, you fear death after all."

"I do. Of course I do." Yun Che struggled to regulate his breathing. His voice was hoarse and weak from his severe injuries, and each word seemed forced through gritted teeth, yet they were utterly clear and resolute.

"I am, perhaps, the person in this world who fears death the most. Because if I die… should you one day recover your memories, you would be heartbroken beyond measure.² More importantly, if I die, my homeland… our homeland, will be plunged forever into an unpredictable and irresistible abyss of calamity." His eyes reflected a hazy, gentle light, yet they also projected a resolute will that stemmed from the deepest part of his soul.

Shen Wuyi's lips moved… but she could not bring herself to utter any more soul-piercing words.

"Qingyue, I know Shenwu Yeye wants you to kill me. The reason is that I touched upon the scars of her past betrayals atop the Cloud Top of Eden, and this is undoubtedly the perfect place to do it… You don't need to confirm or deny it. Right now, I pose no threat to you. I don't even have the strength to escape. I only ask that you give me some time to finish what I have to say."

Shen Wuyi neither moved nor spoke, her cold eyes simply staring… but at least, she did not refuse, nor did she leave.

Yun Che's breathing steadied slightly. He took a light breath and spoke slowly, "I am not Meng Jian Yuan. Yun Che is my real name. And you are Xia Qingyue. We were married in Floating Cloud City when we were sixteen… This world has no Floating Cloud City, because it exists in our homeland."

Shen Wuyi: "..."

"You say you are a selfish and cold-hearted person. I think this perceived coldness of yours might be because your body and soul are both rejecting this world." Like a small stone dropped into a still pond, this sentence seemed to cause a momentary ripple in Shen Wuyi's gaze.

"I understand that feeling of rejecting the world. And that rejection is precisely because we do not belong to this world. Our homeland is the very 'Eternal Pure Land' that the people of this world have yearned for for generations, and are now on the verge of entering."

Yun Che's words would have been world-shaking to any person of the Abyss. Shen Wuyi's expression did not change, nor did she interrupt him. She simply stared at him coldly, listening.

"Our homeland has no Abyssal Dust, but it has countless green trees and blooming flowers, with innumerable races and worlds of all sizes. The colors of the world, the number of living beings, surpasses the Abyss by an unknowable degree. However, the loss of the world's spiritual energy has made it impossible for the profound practitioners of our homeland to break through the Divine Master Realm."

"The moment the people of the Abyss set foot there, all life in our homeland will become lambs to the slaughter. The fragile laws of that world will also spawn countless disasters, unable to withstand the power of Demigods and True Gods."

"This is also the reason I came to this world."

With every sentence, every word, he looked directly into Shen Wuyi's eyes, all his emotions reflected in his gaze without reservation.

Shen Wuyi spoke faintly, "Are you trying to say that you want to stop the Pure Lands and the God Kingdoms from entering the Eternal Pure Land?"

"Correct."

"Just you?"

"Yes, just me."

He answered without hesitation, without fear. "The Abyssal Emperor and the Four Divine Officials are beings of immense power. Even below the Pure Lands, among the Six God Kingdoms, there are countless experts who could annihilate me into dust with a flick of their finger. And I, a mere Divine Master, must stop the opening of the next Void-Breaking Grand Array in no more than forty years."

"It's absurd, laughable, isn't it?" Any profound practitioner of the Abyss who heard this would find it absurd and laughable. But Shen Wuyi, who had previously offered only cold words and mockery, did not use this opportunity to speak any heart-stabbing remarks.

"Therefore, I can only resort to any means necessary… cloaking myself in layer after layer of disguise, integrating into this world step by step. I used dirty tricks to get close to Hua Caili, and despicable methods to become Meng Jian Yuan… all to make the alliance between the Dreamweaver, Skypiercer, and Forest of Darkness kingdoms fall apart, and even planted the seeds for them to turn on each other." He laid bare his most important stratagems in this world to Shen Wuyi with utter frankness.

The cold moon in Shen Wuyi's eyes grew even more profound. No one knew what she was thinking.

"Qingyue…" His call was a soft whisper, like something from a distant dream.

He narrowed his eyes slightly, a smile on his lips. "You have lost your past, so you cannot understand how joyful I am, how grateful I am to the heavens, to be able to see you again."

"In the dreams I wove for myself, I imagined countless times that if you were to reappear in my life, I would do anything to make it up to you. I would use any means necessary to completely weave your life into mine… But, we have finally reunited in another world, under the weight of such a heavy fate."

He opened his eyes again, all the warmth and affection now veiled beneath a gaze of infinite clarity and depth. "How can the weight of personal feelings compare to that of a homeland on the brink of collapse… Qingyue, I, who owe you so much, still need your help the most right now."

"Our homeland is not their 'Eternal Pure Land.' It is our Eternal Pure Land. I am the Emperor of the 'Eternal Pure Land.'"

"And you are the Empress."

Having said so much at once, Yun Che's breathing became ragged again. He silently suppressed his injuries, his face as pale as paper, yet he showed none of the frailty one would expect from being so grievously wounded… because this world did not permit him a single moment of weakness.

"Are you finished?"

Her voice was still bone-chilling. "A fine story. So absurd that I doubt even the so-called mortal wordsmiths could concoct it in a fit of madness. However… because it is so absurd, I'm actually inclined to believe some of it."

She narrowed her eyes, her gaze like the unmelted snow of an endless, frozen domain—exquisitely pure, yet utterly devoid of warmth. "Assuming what you say is true, an emperor from another world, an imposter posing as a Divine Son of a God Kingdom, a shadow stirring up chaos among three God Kingdoms… has just revealed all these secrets, without reservation, to a Divine Maiden of a God Kingdom?"

"Even if my past self was truly the 'Xia Qingyue' you speak of, the person I am now is purely and completely Shen Wuyi, the current Divine Maiden of the Eternal Night God Kingdom. The Xia Qingyue you speak of has not a single trace of existence in my life or my consciousness."

"With a single word from me, all your aspirations and schemes will be exposed to the world and turned to ash. In that case… isn't this so-called emperor from another world a bit too naive, too foolish?"

"How can someone so naive and foolish be worthy of shouldering the fate of an entire world?"

Gulp! A coppery taste surged up Yun Che's throat, but he forced it down, leaving only a few long trickles of blood escaping the corners of his lips. But his eyes remained as clear as ever, like distant, undying stars in the dark night.

"I already gave you my answer… because you are Xia Qingyue. The Xia Qingyue who, though grievously wounded by fate, left all her gentleness and kindness to the world, and took all the pain and death upon herself."

Shen Wuyi: "..."

"The disguise you've crafted for yourself can no longer fool me. And I will never again hesitate or doubt you."

Yun Che slowly raised his hand. Where his palm pointed, the surrounding Abyssal Dust seemed to answer his call, slowly gathering and swirling into a fine, gray vortex. Shen Wuyi's beautiful eyes constricted, and for the first time, a powerful emotion flickered across her jade-like face.

"You can also interfere with the Abyssal Dust, can't you?"

He said softly, "This is the proof that our fates are connected."

She stared fixedly at the Abyssal Dust in Yun Che's palm, seemingly lost in a brief trance.

But in the next moment, her gaze turned cold again. She said suddenly, "Answer one question for me."

"Alright," Yun Che's voice and gaze softened at once.

She said coldly, "You claim I am your wife, and that we were married when we were sixteen. Then why…"

"Am I still a virgin!"

"..."

This question, this "flaw" in his story, left Yun Che momentarily at a loss for how to answer.

"Hmph!"

Yun Che's brief silence earned him a cold snort from Shen Wuyi. Just as she was about to speak again, she heard Yun Che lower his gaze slightly and begin to recite in a low voice: "It is said that when Heaven and Earth intermingle, all things are born in harmony; when man and woman are properly matched, the universe finds its order. Hereby, Che, the only son of the fifth branch of the Xiao Clan of Floating Cloud City, Azure Wind Nation, aged sixteen, of upright character and appearance, and gentle temperament, upholds the pure reputation of his family and possesses the grace of unpolished jade; Qingyue, beloved daughter of the Xia Clan, aged sixteen, her face like glazed porcelain reflecting the moon, her elegance pure and transcendent, is well-versed in the virtues of the women's quarters and carries the grace of a secluded orchid."

Shen Wuyi: "...?"

His recitation continued, each word piercing deep into the sea of her soul: "Recalling when Qingyue was young and frail, her life hanging by a thread, Lord Xiao saved her with his own life, and Lord Xia, weeping tears of blood, swore an oath, thus sealing this blessed union for eternity. This marriage certificate is written today, with the clan's spirit tablets as witness and a profound crystal contract as proof, to certify the union of Xiao Che and Xia Qingyue."

"May the two henceforth walk hand in hand, aiding each other on the profound path. In wealth, they shall share together; in poverty, they shall remain by each other's side. In peril, they shall face life and death as one; in peace, their lives shall be in harmony. May they stay together for a lifetime, to witness the long road of the Great Dao; may they never abandon one another, to forever be bathed in the spiritual grace of Heaven and Earth."

"This certificate is solemnly made to bear witness to this vow."

Yun Che touched his fingers to his lips, staining them with crimson blood. He then pressed his fingertip firmly onto an unstained part of his sleeve. When he lifted it, a deep, complete fingerprint remained.

Rip!

He tore off the sleeve bearing the fingerprint and gently pushed it toward the stunned Shen Wuyi. She subconsciously raised her hand and caught the piece of cloth, a faint warmth spreading through her palm.

"What… are you doing?"

Seeing that she didn't discard the torn sleeve, he seemed to smile with satisfaction. "After I lost you, I witnessed your former memories. The end you gave yourself was nothing but a bright red wedding dress, and…"

"That marriage certificate, which you kept carefully hidden in the sash around your waist."

Just then, a cry filled with panic and fury suddenly rang out. "Brother Yun! Shen Wuyi… stop!!"

As the young woman's cry arrived, a brilliant sword light split the darkness, sundered space, and, carrying boundless fury, stabbed directly toward Shen Wuyi's back.
