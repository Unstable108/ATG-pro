Eternal Night Kingdom of God.

Seven overlapping profound formations were running at full power. The colorful abyssal crystals inside the profound formations were emitting a profound light so bright that it pierced the eyes. The quantity and level of these abyssal crystals were such that any profound practitioner would be astonished like they were dreaming.

Four women were standing on each corner of the profound formations. The terrible power circling their hands was that of a Divine Limit Realm profound practitioner.

It was their power that was fueling the seven profound formations. The energy within the abyssal crystals was being discharged at an insane, violent rate that could easily annihilate a profound practitioner who just entered the Divine Extinction Realm; a Half God.

A woman was sitting at the center of this terrifying profound formation. Her long hair and robe were being flung about crazily, and her exquisite countenance was twitching non-stop. It was an instinctive, physical reaction caused by extreme pain.

Her expression was extremely calm, however. It stubbornly refused to reveal even a hint of pain.

Gradually, her skin began losing its rosy color and grew deathly pale. An indefinite amount of time later, scarlet blood began dripping down the corners of her lips.

Shenwu Youluan’s aura hitched a little at the sight of this. Signs of struggles flashed in her eyes until she finally said, “Supreme one, this is a level of intensity not even a late-stage Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner can endure. Even if Wuyi possesses the Nine Profound Exquisite Body, she must surely have exceeded her limit. At this rate—”

“Silence!”

A ruthless, hoarse, and ice cold voice ripped Shenwu Youluan’s begging in half. “It will stop when I deem it is time to stop!”

Shenwu Yi was at level five Divine Extinction Realm right now. If she was anyone else, the spirit energy storm happening inside the seven profound formations would have exploded their profound veins in less than a hundred breaths. The consequences would have been unimaginable.

Shenwu Yi had been stuck inside the seven profound formations for fifteen minutes straight.

Why were they doing this? Because she possessed a universally known body that had not appeared for far too long, the Nine Profound Exquisite Body. As the Exquisite Worlds inside her body slowly awakened, her profound veins and her body’s endurance toward power and laws became far greater than that of an ordinary profound practitioner.

It was also how Shenwu Yi had grown from a peak Divine Master to a level five Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner in just twenty years. The speed of her progress was such that no Kingdom of God even believed when their spies brought the uncertain news back to them. Even fewer people knew what kind of cruelty she went through to obtain such progress.

Shenwu Yanye had invested all of the Eternal Night Kingdom of God’s top resources on Shenwu Yi like a madwoman. As a result, given the same amount of time, the number of abyssal crystals Shenwu Yi consumed far exceeded every other Divine Son and Divine Daughter combined.

It was a progress and procedure only she could undergo. No other Divine Son and Divine Daughter could replicate this feat even if they knew about it.

Shenwu Yanye was a madwoman in every sense of the word. Every man and woman in the other Kingdoms of God knew this, and the Eternal Night Kingdom of God only knew this more.

Another fifteen minutes passed, and Shenwu Yi’s face was completely drained of blood. Her body was also spasming even harder than before.

Her expression remained as calm and collected as ever, however. It was as if she could feel neither pain nor fear.

Shenwu Youluan had long since closed her eyes, unable to look at her for even a moment longer.

It was at this moment Shenwu’s body finally started shaking violently. At the same time, her waist and her chest began splitting apart as if they were pushed way past their limit. Her aura had fallen into complete disorder.

Her consciousness departed her mind, and a shower of blood spurted through her lips. She slowly fell backward.

A withered hand finally reached out from behind a black curtain. In an instant, the profound light of the seven profound formations extinguished, and the rampaging spirit energy was suppressed and dispelled entirely.

Shenwu Youluan dashed forward and caught Shenwu Yi before she could hit the floor. It took a long time before Shenwu Yi’s eyes finally regained their focus.

“Hmph. Useless thing!” Shenwu Yanye’s icy, shrill voice rang out. “Is this all the Nine Profound Exquisite Body can do?”

“Listen well, Wuyi. You must enter the sixth level of the Divine Extinction Realm before you head to the Pure Land. Otherwise, my wrath will be severe.”

Shenwu Youluan tried to say something, but she felt Shenwu Yi grabbing her hand and silencing her.

With great difficulty, Shenwu Yi climbed out of Shenwu Youluan’s lap and responded in a weak but respectful and determined voice, “You invested all of your resources and heart’s blood in me, Mother. I would not be able to forgive myself if I let down your expectations.”

“As you should,” Shenwu Yanye replied coldly. “Now, get out of my sight and rest! We will continue in seven days!”

Shenwu Yi whispered, “Don’t worry, Mother. I only need five days.”

She looked up and said in a weak yet obsessed voice that seemed to originate from the bottom of her soul, “Mother does not want the women of this world to be inferior to land. When the Pure Land Meet happens, I promise to defeat all the Divine Sons and make them all prostrate themselves before the Eternal Night. Only then can I live up to your expectations and repay a sliver of your kindness.”

“So do not worry about my injuries... this body may die, but your wish... will be done.”

As soon as she finished, she shook again and bubbled blood between her lips. Then, she fell completely unconscious against Shenwu Youluan.

There was a moment of dead silence that lasted a few breaths. Finally, Shenwu Yanye said in a cold voice, “Take her away, Youluan.”

“As you command,” Shenwu Youluan hurriedly responded and rushed off with an unconscious Shenwu Yi.

“All of you, get out of my sight!”

The Eternal Night Divine Palace emptied as soon as her terrifying voice resounded. It wasn’t long before stifling silence was left.

A withered hand searched around in the darkness and flipped open the Secret Tome... just now, a few months after the last time, she had finally expelled another layer of abyssal dust and successfully unlocked a new page.

Her withered fingers brushed against the material. Her sharpened four senses could easily identify the old words covered in a thin layer of abyssal dust.

Heart of Snow Glazed Glass.

It was a page regarding the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass.

“Heart of Snow Glazed Glass... A creation of the purest primordial energy at the beginning of Primal Chaos... the purest heart and soul of the entire universe... multiple rumors claiming that a bearer of the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass is protected by the Heavenly Way... unclear if it is true or not...”

“It can see the truth of the world... perceive all hearts and souls... heart is so pure it is like fresh snow, clean, white, and unblemished... as such, the bearer’s love, will, heart, thoughts, loyalty... once engraved are constant, never-changing, and eternal...”

The withered finger began shaking as she let out a shrill cry, “Love and loyalty... constant, never-changing and eternal, is it? Hahaha... hahahaha...”

“There is no true love in this world! No loyalty! It’s fake... how laughable... it’s all fake... hahahaha... hahahahahahaha...”

She laughed loudly and wildly like a ghoul who had lost her mind. However, there were clearly tear stains on her withered, bark-like skin.

After taking Shenwu Yi back to her bedroom, Shewu Youluan immediately produced a couple of recovery pills—her hands fumbling a few times from how worried she was—and laid down a healing profound formation.

Shenwu Youluan slowly closed her eyes as she watched Shenwu Yi’s deathly pale complexion and felt the warmth of the formation’s gentle profound light. She was trying her best to stop her tears from pouring out.

“I’m sorry... Wuyi.” she murmured, “If I knew this would happen... I would never have...”

“You never need to apologize to me, aunt.”

The sudden voice snapped Shenwu Youluan out of her sorrow. There was a flicker of panic in her opening eyes, but she forced herself to stay calm and ask, “You’re... awake, Wuyi?”

“I’ve been awake since the beginning,” Shenwu Yi whispered. “I’m sorry to make you worry, aunt.”

Shenwu Youluan was caught off guard by the response. However, she replied in a natural tone, “If you’re awake, then you can recover faster. That’s great. What I said earlier... it’s just a ramble. You don’t need to pay attention to it.”

“I know,” Shenwu Yi replied softly.

Shenwu Youluan had just let out a small sigh of relief when Shenwu Yi continued, “I’ve always known that the one who saved me... was you, Aunt Youluan.”

It was like a summer thunderclap. Shenwu Youluan immediately shot to her feet and, despite her panic, did not forget to set up a sound-isolating barrier—or at least she tried to, until Shenwu Yi grabbed her arm and forced it down as if she knew Shenwu Youluan would react like this. Considering how weak Shenwu Yi was right now, Shenwu Youluan hurriedly stopped whatever she was doing.

“If you set up a sound-isolating barrier, she will take notice. She must be looking through her Secret Tome right now, so you have nothing to worry about.”

“...” Shenwu Youluan’s eyes widened, and for a moment, she could only stare at Shenwu Yi as if recognizing her for the first time. A while later, she finally said in a hushed voice, “You mustn’t say such things, Wuyi!”

After confirming that the healing profound formation was fine, she took a step backward and said, “Take good care of yourself. I’ll pretend that I haven’t heard a word of what you said earlier, and you mustn’t breathe a word about it either, understand?”

Having said that, she took off as if she were running away.

Right as she was stepping out of the door, Shenwu Yi’s soft whispers hit her. “There is no such thing as eternal night in this world. Even the darkest night must welcome the dawn eventually.”

Shenwu Youluan abruptly stopped in her tracks.

“Aunt, you are the blue luan who’s concealed herself in darkness.”

“And your ‘phoenix’, despite all the humiliation she has suffered, did not escape into the darkness alone.”

“When the eternal night is broken by dawn, the luan and the phoenix will sing together once more.”

“...” Shenwu Youluan trembled. She gritted her teeth with all her might but still couldn’t stop her reaction.

She turned her neck but stopped halfway. It was because she didn’t dare to meet Shenwu Yi’s eyes.

An unknown amount of time later, she finally managed to turn around... to find Shenwu Yi pressing a finger to her lips.

There’s no need to say anything.

Shenwu Youluan nodded, and tears finally streamed down her cheeks.

The name “Fog Monarch” was engulfing the Lands of the Living once more, but this time, it was a million times fiercer than ever before.

In the past, the large majority of profound practitioners would speak of the name with doubt, argument, and ridicule. But now, their voices were infused with never-before-seen shock, horror... and a suspicion they couldn’t voice.

Even the abyssal dust of the Abyss seemed to be restless and shaking.

The whole world was in an uproar, all of them... except the Pure Land. Contrary to Yun Che and everyone’s expectations, it remained as peaceful and silent as ever.

The shallow area of the Endless Fog.

Yun Che had altered his appearance and attire and made his aura murky using the Ni Yuan Stone. Hua Caili could pass right next to him, and not even she would be able to recognize him based on his appearance and aura now.

He had maintained this posture for sixteen to eighteen hours straight. In fact, he had performed the same actions for over ten days.

Finally, he opened his eyes and let out a long breath. Then, he leaned back against the black rock behind him.

A white silhouette appeared, and a jade-like hand approached his forehead and soothed him with the holiest light of the world.

“It’s been twelve days,” she whispered. “What on earth are you searching for? Not even your soul will be able to withstand this for long if you keep it up.”

Yun Che did not answer. He simply closed his eyes and rested. It took him a good amount of time before that bone deep exhaustion in his body finally alleviated somewhat. Instead of answering Li Suo’s question though, he said with a half-smile, “It’s been twelve days, and you still didn’t rebuke me. I’m more curious about your lack-of-reaction than you are regarding your question.”

“Rebuke?” Li Suo looked puzzled. “Why would I rebuke you?”

Yun Che curled his lips. “In order to show off the Fog Monarch’s power to control the Endless Fog, I had cost an entire people their homeland. Many of their loved ones will die from abyssal corruption before they reach the closest haven as well. With your sacred heart, I thought for sure you wouldn’t be able to accept this and rebuke me for it.”

“...” Li Suo did not answer for a very long time.

When Yun Che finally closed his eyes and got ready to take a nap, Li Suo’s answer came so softly he almost missed it. “You’re too lonely.”

“... Hmm?” Yun Che stared at the face he still couldn’t see clearly after all this time. “No I’m not. I have you to keep my company, don’t I?”

Li Suo answered, “I am not He Ling. I can never know your heart, obey your will, and soothe your soul like she could.”

“Besides, I cannot manifest my body like He Ling. I am unable to comfort you when you are depressed and lonely. Every time you are gripped by the throes of loneliness and sorrow and unable to find an outlet, I cannot help but feel guilty about it. How can I possibly rebuke you knowing that?”

“Er...” Yun Che unconsciously rubbed his nose and asked weakly, “When you say ‘comfort’, you don’t mean that kind of comfort, do you?”

Li Suo: “...?”
