When the yellow jade faded as well, Yun Che’s profound energy finally stopped spinning wildly and chaotically. His expression looked a lot more relaxed as well.

If anything, Hua Caili was the one more shaken between the two.

Every time a profound practitioner achieved a breakthrough, their profound energy would experience a new growth and rebirth. This was especially true if they entered a major realm. Their transformation was qualitative to say the least.

Considering the environment and Yun Che’s injuries, it was perfectly normal for him to let slip his profound energy.

The problem was that his profound energy contained five different elements. Excluding light profound energy, which was a power that only existed in the ancient records, there were a total of six elements in the Abyss: Water, Fire, Wind, Lightning, Earth and Darkness. And Yun Che was cultivating five of them at the same time!

This completely went against her aunt’s, father’s, and the High Priests’ teachings.

Not even High Priest Ling Xian, the elemental master of the four High Priests thanks to her special profound veins and divine inheritance, could control this many elements at the same time. Only three.

Hua Caili wanted very much to ask her aunt about this, but she didn’t want to disturb Yun Che. So, she could only resume her watch in silence.

Before she knew it, she was staring at him blankly all over again. 𝚏𝕣𝕖𝚎𝚠𝚎𝚋𝚗𝐨𝐯𝕖𝕝.𝕔𝐨𝕞

By now, the profound energy cyclones on his body had decreased considerably. He seemed to have gotten things completely under control.

It was at this moment something unusual happened. When Yun Che’s profound energy seemingly returned to stability completely, a violent storm appeared out of seemingly nowhere, and countless streams of profound energy flowed into his body, billowing his hair and his clothes.

This was just the beginning. The currents of profound energy were already stunning enough, but it was still growing stronger by the breath. It was as if the natural profound energy in this entire space was being sucked into Yun Che’s body, and not even the abyssal dust could impede its flow.

High up in the sky, Hua Qingying could sense the unnatural flow of profound energy in the surroundings as well. This time, her shock traveled all the way to her soul.

The reason was simple. This commotion should never happen in the Divine Master Realm. In fact, it was more like the breakthrough of the Divine Extinction Realm!

The natural profound energy in the surroundings was still flowing into Yun Che without any signs of stopping. Hua Caili’s hair was kicked up, and the wind was so strong that her veil was almost blown away. She stared at Yun Che like she was staring at a monster she never knew existed... until now.

Not only that, she had a vague feeling that the entire Endless Fog was shaking because of this man’s breakthrough.

Suddenly, Hua Qingying realized that her divine perception had left Hua Caili for seven breaths. That was how shocked she was.

Yun Che...

In the Qilin Abyss Realm, he had destroyed an entire group of Divine Masters as a Divine Sovereign. Now, he was affecting the world like a Half-God would during his breakthrough.

It was clear that he possessed a power that transcended common sense.

Just where did he come from?

The crazy storm would last at least a hundred breaths before it finally slowed to a stop.

Yun Che’s black hair slowly fell back on his shoulders, and he looked so peaceful it was like he was asleep.

Even the wounds marring his face had faded a lot.

A certain girl who was guarding him didn’t feel calm, however. Not even close.

Meanwhile, Li Suo was observing Hua Caili’s reaction and attempting to figure out what Yun Che was planning.

He should be doing his utmost to keep his secrets hidden until he was powerful enough to protect himself.

Instead, he had done the complete opposite of what the Devil Queen had told him to.

He should have a reason for doing this though.

It was at this moment that Hua Caili suddenly turned around and looked behind her. Her eyes were narrowing slowly.

She could sense five auras approaching her direction rapidly, and four of them were Half-Step Divine Extinction Realm and close to her level.

As for the aura at the center of the group... it was clearly the aura of a Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner!

This was the first time she had encountered such a powerful group in this area of the Endless Fog.

As the group came closer and closer, their voices reached her as well.

“The commotion definitely came from this direction.”

“Such a thick blood stench... a terrible battle must have happened here a while ago.”

Very soon, five people entered Hua Caili’s gaze. They were all wearing gray clothes, and their eyes shone with a powerful light.

Below the Kingdoms of God, a Half-Step Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner was respected no matter where they went. In fact, they were indomitable powers in certain places. However, these four were obeying their leader with perfect obedience and respect.

Most people chose to wear dark-colored clothes in the Endless Fog to better conceal themselves, but the Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner was wearing a set of silver clothes. He wasn’t even hiding the protective divine runes circulating around his body, which made him an even more conspicuous target than he already was.

He was a Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner. He could afford to be flashy even in the Endless Fog.

The five men stared at the floor of abyssal beast carcasses with severe expressions. However, they were unable to determine the strength of these abyssal beasts because a dead abyssal beast quickly lost the abyssal dust it was holding quickly.

Then, they turned to look at Hua Caili and Yun Che. They were a Half-Step Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner and a peak second level Divine Master. The woman’s aura was unsteady as if she had just consumed a lot of profound energy a while ago, whereas the peak second level Divine Master was slowly regaining his profound energy. He was clearly in the middle of a breakthrough.

The caution in their eyes disappeared instantly.

Hua Caili waved her hand and enveloped the area Yun Che was in in a small barrier. She then held the Glass Cloud Sword protectively in front of her, ready to defend herself at a moment’s notice.

Her eyes looked like stars, her skin looked like snow, and her sword was as pure as jade and glass. Despite the veil, the glimpses of beauty she revealed were still enough to attract their gazes and strum their heartstrings.

She shouldn’t exist in the Endless Fog. In fact... she shouldn’t belong in this filthy world.

The silver-robed man quickly noticed his loss of manners and shot her a kind smile. “Please calm down, fairy. We were drawn over by the commotion and thought that someone might need our help. Since both of you look fine, we shan’t disturb you any longer.”

This was his first time ever seeing such a stunning woman, but this was the Endless Fog, and he had something important he must attend to as soon as possible. This was the worst possible time to be getting involved in some side matter.

He knew all this, but he still couldn’t help but ask, “It’s not easy to encounter another person in the Endless Fog. My name is Fan Qingzhou. May I have the honor of knowing your name, fairy?”

He looked proud as he announced himself. It was because he was sure that the entire world would know his name very soon.

Hua Caili didn’t answer him. She simply watched him warily.

She had encountered such a scene far too many times in the Endless Fog already. Most wouldn’t even bother with pleasantries and bared their fangs outright.

After a few seconds of silence, Fan Qingzhou realized that he wouldn’t be getting an answer. It was a regrettable outcome, but considering his circumstances, Fan Qingzhou let it go and said with a smile, “Never mind. I shan’t take up your time any longer.”

“Let’s go.”

One last lingering look later, Fan Qingzhou finally removed his gaze from Hua Caili’s face and turned around. It was at this moment one of his subordinates shouted, “Abyssal crystal!”

Abyssal crystals were rare, but it was unbefitting for a Half-Step Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner to let out such a cry. Fan Qingzhou was about to rebuke the man when he saw what his subordinate saw and found himself unable to look away.

Less than sixty meters to Hua Caili’s left, a unique, grayish light was shining in between the severed halves of a massive abyssal beast. Normally, the abyssal crystal should’ve caught their attention immediately, but Hua Caili was so beautiful that they saw it only as they were about to leave.

More importantly, this abyssal crystal was a full sixth of a meter long!

They had never seen such a massive abyssal crystal in the Endless Fog—no, in their lives!

“This... has to be thirty to forty catties at least, right?” One man asked after an audible gulp.

Another man said, “I don’t think it can be measured by the average standards.”

Fan Qingzhou shot Hua Caili a glance and said, “So? It’s not ours.”

“No, this is the Endless Fog, so it belongs to no one,” whispered a man standing to Fan Qingzhou’s right. “Don’t forget your ‘mission’, brother. If you obtain this crystal, then you can complete your mission immediately. There’s nothing more important to you than that, is there?”

Fan Qingzhou hesitated for an instant and took a step forward. He was just about to say something when an invisible sword beam suddenly cut through the dark air.

The sword beam carried the abyssal crystal behind Hua Caili and into the protective barrier immediately.

Hua Caili was a Divine Daughter. Not even a hundred-catty abyssal crystal was worth her attention. But Yun Che was the one who slew these abyssal beasts, so of course the abyssal crystal should go to him. Since she had promised Yun Che to protect him, how could she allow his loot to fall into another person’s hands?

Fan Qingzhou narrowed his eyes a little. His smile was no longer as warm and harmless as before. “Fairy, you don’t look six hundred years old, but you’re already a Half-Step Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner. You must come from quite the background.”

Hua Caili: “...”

“In that case, you should understand that the law of the jungle reigns in the Endless Fog.”

The glint in his half-lidded eyes grew increasingly dangerous as he casually walked toward her. “Since this abyssal crystal was found in the Endless Fog, then it should rightfully go to the strong. A weakling who insists on holding onto it... will only get themselves killed.”

“I’m sure you understand such simple logic.”

Hua Caili was fearless, however. She said slowly, “Is this the conduct of a Squire of Pure Land?”

Her voice was icy yet unbelievably melodious. However, Fan Qingzhou froze as if she had cast a spell on him.

Hua Caili continued, “Before becoming an Abyssal Knight, a Squire must go through nine trials. One of them is the Trial of the Endless Fog.”

“An Abyssal Knight must have a noble soul. If this is how you pass through the Trial of the Endless Fog, then even if you do become an Abyssal Knight in the future, you will only bring shame to your title!”

Hua Caili spent over ninety nine percent of her time in the Pure Land, and all Squires-in-trial would be marked with a special Pure Land imprint. That was how she had recognized his identity immediately.

“...” Fan Qingzhou’s expression grew uncertain.

He had no idea how the woman figured out that he was a Squire-in-trial, and he had never regretted introducing himself more than he did now.

Behind Fan Qingzhou, his four subordinates were caught in stunned silence as well.

“Haha, you’re overthinking this, fairy,” Fan Qingzhou changed his tone. “I was just advising you to put away the abyssal crystal as soon as possible. After all, the greatest sin one can commit in this Endless Fog is to harbor a treasure that you’re too weak to protect.”

“As for me, I am the man who swore to become an Abyssal Knight. I have long since engraved into my soul the duty to defend the order of the Abyss and protect all of its denizens. I would never lower myself to take from the weak.”

After he was done defending himself, he stopped looking at the abyssal crystal and turned away, waving. “It is clear that our presence is unnecessary. Let’s leave.”

Countless greedy and reluctant gazes swept across the abyssal crystal, but none of his subordinates dared to defy Fan Qingzhou’s order. They quickly followed behind him and left.

Hua Caili let out a small sigh of relief. The Glass Cloud Sword also returned to normal.

It was at this moment Yun Che spoke up, “You need to leave now.”

Hua Caili looked around in surprise. “Are you done with your breakthrough already?”

“No.” Yun Che was still closing his eyes, and his voice wasn’t coming from his mouth. “You need to leave now before it’s too late.”

“Why’s that?” Hua Caili looked confused.

Yun Che’s profound energy was merging and swelling at a rapid pace. He was currently in the final stage of his breakthrough. “You should’ve given them the abyssal crystal just now. If you had, then it would be a happy ending for everyone. After all, what he said wasn’t wrong. The abyssal crystal can only go to the strong.”

“But not only did you refuse to give up the abyssal crystal, you exposed the fact that he was a Squire undergoing a trial to become an Abyssal Knight.”

“A ‘noble soul’ is the label of every Abyssal Knight. If his behavior was exposed, it would become a black mark in his career even if he became an Abyssal Knight in the future. Not only that, he was stupid enough to give you his name. This means that he will soon return to silence you!”

Hua Caili’s mouth parted slightly. “But... our brief interaction didn’t even count as conflict. He wouldn’t go so far... would he?”

“He definitely will,” Yun Che replied. “You’re noble-born, so I’m sure you don’t understand just how important the title is to a profound practitioner with an ordinary background. It could very well be the dream he has chased after his whole life; the highest honor that would elevate his entire clan and his descendants to unimaginable heights.”

“As if that isn’t enough, Fan Qingzhou is half a step away from becoming an Abyssal Knight. He will not allow any ‘accidents’ to impact his chances... even if that chance is miniscule.”

Hua Caili was too inexperienced to pick up the hint of murder in Fang Qingzhou’s eyes as he turned around, but not Yun Che.

Hua Caili might have experienced all kinds of evil during her trial, but she still found it difficult to accept Yun Che’s words.

It was because this was a Squire-in-trial they were talking about, not your average stock.

The very first trial a Squire must go through was the Trial of the Heart. The fact that he was undergoing the Trial of the Endless Fog right now meant that he couldn’t be too bad a person.

So, she comforted Yun Che, “Don’t worry. He wouldn’t. Abyssal Knights are all righteous people. Fan Qingzhou might just be a Squire, but the fact that he’s qualified to participate in the trials proves that he isn’t too bad a person.”

Hua Caili respected the Abyssal Monarch deeply, and her affection for everything in the Pure Land was as deep as the sea.

Yun Che scoffed internally. In the end, she’s just a hothouse flower. Her understanding of good and evil is so shallow it’s laughable.

He explained slowly, “What gives an Abyssal Knight their ‘righteousness’ isn’t their nature, but the status itself.”

“...” Hua Caili blinked and shot Yun Che a strange look. Why are you talking like my senior when you’re not even sixty?

“The title ‘Abyssal Knight’ is both an honor and a restriction. However, those who desire to become an Abyssal Knight care little for its restrictions. They are infinitely willing to bury their own natures and imitate a ‘noble soul’ as best they can.”

“This superficial change does not mean that their nature has changed though.” His tone slowly darkened. “In the public, an Abyssal Knight was an impartial defender of order and a stern adjudicator. But in a place where no eyes could see—especially a place like the Endless Fog where death is all too easy—there is no need for them to pretend to be a ‘noble soul’ at all. If anything, this was his last chance to let loose his repressed nature to his heart’s content!”

“Plus, he isn’t an Abyssal Knight yet. He is a Squire working toward becoming an Abyssal Knight.”

“But!” Hua Caili argued, “I’m not going to out him or anything! Who would silence a person just because of something like this? Plus, he would’ve killed us already if that was his plan!”

“You overestimate a person’s bottom line.” Yun Che let out a forlorn sigh. “The only reason he didn’t attack us earlier is because he had company. If he killed us, he would only be giving his four Half-Step Divine Extinction Realm companions a weakness to exploit.”

“The Endless Fog is the easiest place to conceal oneself, and the hardest place to track another. He will definitely ditch his companions and return as soon as possible. At the latest, he will show up in a hundred breaths.”

Hua Caili wanted to argue more, but a low chuckle came from behind her before she could begin.

“If you already know my plan, then why are you still here? I don’t know whether to call you smart or stupid.”

Hua Caili wheeled around and saw a familiar figure stepping out of the fog. He was none other than Fang Qingzhou.

His face was no longer gentle, and his voice was icy and cold. The purple, lightning-covered sword in his hand was the last proof she needed to see that he was ready to kill.

All of her arguments died inside her mouth. Yun Che’s prediction... was spot on.

Hua Caili was one-third shocked and two-thirds dazed. She couldn’t understand why a powerful Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner would actually try to silence someone just because there was a tiny chance they might become a black mark in their career, not to mention that this was a Squire who had a high chance of becoming an Abyssal Knight, a symbol of all that was pure and righteous.

As a girl who had grown up in the Pure Land and held deep affection for everything it held and represented, this was a shocking moment for Hua Caili to say the least.
