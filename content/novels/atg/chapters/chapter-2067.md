“After the Former Divine Regent learned about her past, he immediately summoned and rebuked me for having an affair with a sin marked ordinary woman. He told me that I tarnished the name of the Heaven Breaker Divine Son and asked me to cut off all ties with her.”

“The Former Divine Regent was only reprimanding me and not angry at first. But I was too young and naive at that time. I was too proud and arrogant. I didn’t know how to think long term, didn’t know how to make false pretenses. I retorted against him on the spot and made it clear that my love for Wanxin was already as deep as the ocean, that I’ve never cared about her background, and moreover would never abandon her for the sake of the Divine Son’s name.

“Hahaha,” Hua Fuchen laughed softly, now knowing whether he was laughing at his own self back then or laughing at the cruelty of fate. “At that time, I felt that as a man, I should be this generous and passionate. I was determined to stand firm and be fearless for my beloved.”

“This, without a doubt, incited the thunderous rage of the Former Divine Regent.”

“The Former Divine Regent’s wrath failed to shake my heart in the slightest. In order to prove my feelings to Wanxin and the Former Divine Regent, I was even more inseparable from her after that, not fearing anyone’s gaze or words.”

“The Former Divine Regent reprimanded and enraged me countless times afterwards. He even personally met Wanxin to apply divine pressure. However, neither one of us retreated or was afraid. Our feelings were like a boat against the current, becoming more and more tough and indestructible.”

Yun Che listened silently. He could sense the heaviness in Hua Fuchen’s voice even though thousands of years had passed.

“Later on, the Former Divine Regent compromised. He said that after I succeeded as the Divine Regent, Wanxin could enter the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God as a concubine but she must not step out of the kingdom and must not show her face in public.”

Yun Che slightly moved his eyebrows. “The Former Divine Regent... did he regret his words later?”

If he were Hua Fuchen, he would accept it immediately. After inheriting the Divine Regent power, he would have the final say in the entire Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God, so why would he care about the Former Divine Regent?”

“No, no.” Hua Fuchen sorrowfully voiced out the two nos. “I refused, and refused quite angrily. All I felt at that time was that the Former Divine Regent’s words were an insult to Wanxin. I angrily responded on the spot that I didn’t want the Divine Son status and would never separate from Wanxin.”

“It was also this sentence that planted an irreversible disaster. Hehe... Hahahaha, my past self, how foolish, how impulsive, how self-absorbed and arrogant to be so naive as to think that being sincere enough, resolute enough, and fearless enough would be able to overcome everything!”

“Just like you and Caili now.”

Yun Che didn’t respond to his words but instead interjected, “So Caili’s mother truly was killed by the Former Divine Regent?”

Hua Fuchen suddenly turned his eyes, his gaze like a sword, “Truly?”

Yun Che calmly explained, “Caili was admonished to address her grandfather as ‘Former Divine Regent,’ so I guessed that you must’ve had an unresolvable grudge against this ‘Former Divine Regent’ and it would most likely be related to Caili’s mother.”

“Although you have never mentioned it to Caili, with her intelligence, I believe that she had an inkling a long time ago. She’s probably never brought it up out of consideration for your feelings.”

Hua Fuchen looked deeply at Yun Che and slowly uttered two incomparably heavy words, “You’re right.”

“Countless attempts later, the Former Divine Regent saw that my attitude was firm and irreversible and was extremely disappointed in me. Thus, he shifted the hope of succession to Qingying.”

“However, Qingying was even more resolute in her refusal. She had long ago sworn in her heart to pursue the sword for the rest of her life and would never be distracted by anything else. If she was forced again, she would rather leave the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God.

At this moment, Yun Che suddenly understood what Hua Caili had said about Hua Qingying’s lifelong guilt.

Perhaps, it was because she felt that if she hadn’t refused to become the Divine Regent, the tragedy that followed wouldn’t have occurred.

“After that, the Former Divine Regent learned that the always cold-hearted Qingying had become close friends with Wanxin, best friends in fact. He grew even more angry and felt that Wanxin had ruined the children he was most proud of.”

Hua Fuchen’s voice slowed even more as it became heavier, “Back then, I was afraid that the Former Divine Regent would kill Wanxin out of anger so I swore with my life on the line that if Wanxin encountered any accidents, I would die with her. However, I underestimated human nature, underestimated the Kingdom of God’s will of inheritance, and overestimated my childish and ignorant self.

“Wanxin got pregnant, and the Former Divine Regent’s descendent lay in her belly. His attitude softened and he seemed to no longer be forcibly going against us. That was also the most relaxed and happy time for Wanxin and me. Until she suddenly disappeared in the eighth month of pregnancy.”

“Phew...” Hua Fuchen’s chest was heaving heavily, his fingers clenched unnaturally. “When Qingying and I found her, she had been stabbed with fifty-four Soul Ending Nails...”

“He did it not only to vent his hatred but also to harm Caili, the child in the womb.”

“Why?” This was something that Yun Che could not understand.

“In order to fundamentally preserve the face of the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God, in order to eliminate future troubles forever, in order to force me into a dead end!”

Hua Fuchen continued, “Wanxin gave birth to Caili with the last bit of her strength. But under the destructive injuries of the Soul Ending Nails, Caili’s meridians, profound veins, and even her soul had all been broken, relying on the Heaven Prayer Jades Qingying and I carried to barely survive.”

“It was also at this time that the Former Divine Regent appeared. Just when I was about to pounce on him and chew him out of anger, he told me that Wanxin was bound for certain death but if I wanted to save the last remaining bloodline Wanxin left me, there was only one method... Which was to send Caili into the Pure Land’s ‘Cradle’ and have her biological father inherit the power of a True God, to become the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God’s Divine Regent for at least ten thousand years.”

He knew that Hua Caili had no reservations around Yun Che and had already informed him about the existence of the “Cradle”, thus he had no qualms about his words.

“...” A chill ran through Yun Che’s heart.

He wanted Hua Fuchen to become the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God’s Divine Regent but he would never allow Qu Wanxin to become the Heaven Breaker Empress. As such, he killed Qu Wanxin, harmed their child, and forced Hua Fuchen to succeed the Divine Regent position for at least ten thousand years.

Even though the topic of inheritance was the biggest concern for many great powers, it was also rare to be ruthless to such an extent.

Hua Fuchen turned around and stared at Yun Che from a short distance. “Do you understand now?”

Yun Che bowed deeply and said, “Senior Divine Regent not hesitating to reveal the most painful scar of his life in order to patiently persuade a humble junior like myself is an admirable, broad-minded magnanimity that I’m a thousand times grateful for and in awe of. I completely understand the meaning behind your words.”

Hua Fuchen slowly nodded. “I’m glad you understand, and I believe that you will also make the most correct, the most rational... only choice.”

Yun Che however, said, “But I may have to disappoint you, senior.”

“You!” Hua Fuchen’s brows furrowed slightly as he spoke with disappointment, “It seems that you still don’t understand.”

Yun Che’s gaze was clear, his words enunciated and resonant, “You are telling me that the so-called true love, determination, and fearlessness are nothing more than childish and fragile, and even somewhat foolish illusions in the face of predestined fate.”

“For example, you who can kill me with a casual slap; for example, the Boundless Kingdom of God whose thunderous wrath can shake the entire Abyss; for example, the doubts and possible unrest within the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God; for example, the world’s scoffing and mocking of Caili and the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God; and for example, the inviolable supreme Pure Land...”

Yun Che almost completely said what Hua Fuchen was about to say to him before he did. Hua Fuchen said in a slightly stern voice, “If you are clear about all that, why do you still say such foolish words?”

“I already answered that a long time ago.” Yun Che’s demeanor remained calm and resolute. “Both Caili and I have already stepped on the edge of life and death. Therefore, we are no longer afraid of whatever lies ahead.”

“What qualifications do you have to not be afraid?” Hua Fuchen let out a snort. “Based on your cultivation at the third level of the Divine Master Realm? Just with you alone? Aren’t you afraid that I can annihilate you in an instant right now to eliminate all future troubles?!”

“I'm not afraid.” Yun Che answered without the slightest trace of fear. “Because you love your daughter deeply. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have wasted so much time and effort on me as a Divine Regent yourself.”

“You!” Hua Fuchen pointed his finger at un Che and then flung his sleeve down fiercely, laughing in anger. “You’re absolutely right. Caili is not just my daughter but also Wanxin’s only bloodline in the world. I love her more than my own life.”

He raised his hand and covered his heart. “The wound of that year still hurts to this day. My greatest fear is that something similar will happen to Caili. Therefore, after succeeding the position of Divine Regent, I swore that I would let Caili live a peaceful life and never let her suffer such soul-breaking pain.”

“Dian Juizhi is the best choice I found for Caili.”

“The Kingdom of Gods placed great importance on the tradition of inheritance so there were very few marriages between Divine Sons and Divine Daughters of two great kingdoms. However, Dian Jiuzhi is different.”

“When he was at his lowest point, he was reborn from his cocoon due to Caili’s kindness. He has an extremely deep adoration and gratitude for Caili. As the head of all the Divine Sons of the six kingdoms, he did not allow any woman to get close to him for thousands of years, waiting for Caili to grow up and leave the ‘Cradle.’”

“He even took the initiative to promise me again and again that even if he becomes the Boundless End Divine Regent, he will only have Caili for the rest of his life. All the children he raises, except for the one who will succeed the inheritance can have Hua as surnames. Even their divine hall can be stationed in the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God, to not let Caili be too far from her homeland.”

Yun Che: (⊙o⊙)......

“I could feel sincerity in every one of his words. Sincere to the point of being as humble as dust. It was also this unchanging sincerity of thousands of years that touched his quick tempered father Dian Luohou into giving in step by step.

“If they get together, the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God and the Boundless Kingdom of God will be harmoniously united and no one in the world would dare bully them. Dian Jiuzhi would treat Caili extremely well, putting her first in everything, always loving her and spoiling her... Her life will be honored and respected, without disasters, happy and peaceful.”

He looked at Yun Che, “And what will you bring to Caili? Mockery? Anger? Shame? Doubt? An unknown doom? If you truly love her, you should turn away immediately and never see her again, as you chose to do the first time.”

“I understand your love for your daughter,” Yun Che replied.

“You are not a father, so how can you understand?” Hua Fuchen said solemnly “All fathers would want their daughters to have a smooth life without waves, and no father would be willing to watch their daughter rush into waves that would wipe out their life at any time in order to pursue the so-called brilliant flower on the other shore!”

“Even if she loves that ‘brilliant flower’ deeply, even if that ‘brilliant flower’ will really bloom magnificently in the future, there will never be a father who would stand by and watch her rush into those huge waves!”

Those words came from the bottom of his heart, but he did not expect to be able to convince Yun Che, who could never empathize because he was not a father.

But in fact... Yun Che actually did understand. He was also a father and also had a daughter that he regarded as his life.

Unfortunately, he couldn’t reveal any emotion.

“Senior,” Yun Che said suddenly, “Allow me to ask you a somewhat offensive question. If you go back to that year, would you still be willing to meet Caili’s mother?”

“...” This question actually caused Hua Fuchen to freeze in place without an answer.

After waiting several breaths, Yun Che slowly continued, “So you should understand our feelings. Since this is the case, do you still insist on separating us?”

“Yes.” The Heart Painter Divine Regent’s responded without hesitation. “This is exactly the reason why I will never allow you two to be together.”

Yun Che took a deep breath. “It seems that the Former Divine Regent’s ruthless tactics have finally succeeded. You, who was originally forced to succeed the position of Divine Regent after bearing the fate of the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God for ten thousand years, have already become a true Divine Regent of a Kingdom of God.”

“...” Hua Fuchen was speechless.

Yun Che took a step back and respectfully bowed. “Thank you for your teachings, senior, but my feelings for Caili remain unchanged. A thousand words and ten thousand promises are ultimately just empty words. I am aware that I am worthless and unworthy of Caili but my heart for Caili is sincere and pure.”

“I will prove this to you in my own way... farewell.”

After saying that, he no longer stayed and just left straight away, leaving the Heart Painter Divine Regent in silence for a long time.
