Yun Che thought for a moment before answering smilingly, “It’s too soon to be damning the world yet. I need to take care of my future father-in-law first. If I can’t even damn the Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter completely, then how can I hope to damn the entire Abyss?”

Hua Caili pinched the back of his waist and rebuked him in a timid voice, “You... You did all that to me, and you say it’s not enough? Hmph. If Father learns about the bad things you did to me, I’m sure he’ll break your legs.”

“... Is it too late to turn around and run?” Yun Che pretended to be afraid.

Hua Caili leaned forward and hugged him even tighter. "Hehe, naturally. Even if you did run, I’m sure my aunt would catch you like a hawk.”

Hua Qingying: “...”

Yun Che sighed as if worried for his future, but he pushed away his fake expression and declared gently and firmly, “To tell you the truth, I’m not afraid at all. Even if your Father is planning to break my legs, he can... so long as you’re with me, Caili, I can face anyone, do anything without fear.”

“I... I know.” His romantic declaration wet Hua Caili’s eyes instantly.

“So,” Yun Che asked, “you’re not angry anymore, are you?”

“Ah?” Hua Caili blinked once before hitting him lightly. “I wasn’t angry the moment I saw you. I just wanted to see how you would comfort me. Imagine how confused I felt when you started calling yourself a whatever Devil Master...”

She pressed her face into his chest as if to hold back her laughter.

“So... if you get angry again in the future, how do you want me to comfort you?” Yun Che asked.

Hua Caili thought for a moment before looking up, “I want to play with snow.”

Yun Che lifted his hand, and snow immediately started falling from the sky. It took only a moment for thick snow to surround them.

Hua Caili let out an excited cry and released Yun Che. She then pounced into the pure, clean snow.

She kicked off her shoes and removed her socks. She started stepping on snow and left behind many a footprint.

After playing for a bit, she allowed herself to fall backward on the snow. As she lay there wrapped in a cocoon of iciness and purity, she let out a sigh of contentment and said, “If only everything in this world was as pure and simple as snow.”

For an instant, Yun Che was moved by her remark.

Yeah. If only everyone and everything in life was that simple.

Hua Caili lay in the snow with her eyes narrowed and her smooth, soft legs—paler than even the snow around her—swung back and forth like the most beautiful arcs in the world, kicking up patches of snow.

Yun Che watched her, his eyes slowly turning blank as time passed. Before he knew it, he was grabbing her perfect feet and feeling their soft smoothness.

“Hmm... it feels itchy.” Hua Caili let out a giggle before pushing her legs into Yun Che’s lap. She felt his fingers sliding across the delicate, exquisite curves of her calves.

“...” Yun Che subconsciously looked away.

He had built an unassailable fortress deep within his soul from the beginning, and yet this dangerous feeling of increasing attraction was happening more and more frequently despite himself... he couldn’t lie to himself.

Even if his heart must break, and his soul must be ripped into shreds, he must never...

His thoughts were still discombobulated when a sweet voice rang beside his ear, and he found himself pinned in the snow by Hua Caili.

Their eyes met. Her beautiful eyes looked like smoke, rippling waves that could drown one’s soul. Her jade-like lips were pressed lightly into a smile so exquisite it was like the first bloom of a flower. But that wasn’t all. It was also cute and sexy in a way thousands and thousands of flowers could never hope to match; a privilege that was reserved for him and him alone.

She did not get up. Still pinning Yun Che against the snow, her eyes glowed with radiance as she whispered in a seductive voice that should not belong to the Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter at all, “I want it in the snow today.”

The snow gathered, and walls of snow engulfed the space they were in.

The refracted glimmers of snow resembled the first light of the moon. It was so holy, so pure, that the taint underneath its light was exposed down to the finest detail...

Eternal Night Kingdom of God.

The doors of a hall slowly opened into darkness.

This was the central hall of the Eternal Night Kingdom of God, and yet it was so dark and silent it might as well be the depths of hell. Even a Half-God would hold their breath from how cold the hall felt.

A woman slowly stepped into the hall. Her face was deathly pale, and her body was covered in filthy blood. Despite this, her footsteps were light, and she strived to keep her frail aura steady.

Amidst oppressive silence, she stopped in her tracks and slowly fell to her knees. “Wuyi... requests a meeting with you, Mother.”

A pitch black curtain split in half, and a terrific shockwave slammed into Shen Wuyi’s body.

Blood jetted out of her lips as she slammed into the doors of the hall.

“And here I thought you were gone forever, Wuyi. How bold of you. Even you... are starting to disobey me!”

The voice was raspy and scratchy like metal grinding against each other, and the words sharp enough to carve out one’s organs.

The woman was seriously injured in the first place, so it took her an incredibly long time to climb back to her feet. She did not cry out in pain, however. Not even a little. Instead, she knelt back on the floor and said, “Wuyi was late for 194 hours. Wuyi is willing to accept any punishment for her lateness. Wuyi simply requests that you would allow me to say—”

“Silence!”

A terrifying voice pierced through her ears. “Whatever your reason may be, this is the first time you’ve disobeyed my will! At this rate, you’ll just become another Shen Wuqing!”

“Wuyi does not think that at all,” Shen Wuyi said urgently, “Mother is Wuyi’s one and only family in this world. Therefore, Wuyi’s heart and soul can only fit Mother alone. Wuyi would never—”

“Get out of my sight! You will learn the price of your disobedience very soon.”

“As you command, Mother.” Shen Wuyi saluted respectfully. “Please, calm your anger, Mother. You should not hurt yourself for Wuyi!!” “GET! LOST!!” A howl throaty enough to terrify even phantoms erupted.

Shen Wuyi did not dare to say anything else. She performed one more salute before dragging her bloodstained body out of the Eternal Night Divine Hall.

She hadn’t left the entrance for long when a woman wearing a black outfit descended from the sky.

She immediately voiced her concern when she saw Shen Wuyi, “Are you alright, Wuyi?”

Right now, Shen Wuyi’s aura was unbelievably weak. It was clear she had just gained some new wounds as well. The woman immediately figured out what was going on and wore a complicated expression.

“Aunt Youluan.” Shen Wuyi’s manners were impeccable even when she was severely injured. “Wuyi had angered Mother with her lateness. Please calm her down if you can. If Mother hurts herself because of Wuyi, Wuyi... will not be able to rest easy.”

She did not complain, defend herself, or beg for comfort. Her pleas were completely on behalf of the Mother who just hurt her.

Shenwu Youluan lifted her hand and gave Shen Wuyi’s wrist a squeeze. “You just happened upon Mother on a bad time. She will recover soon. Go heal your wounds and don’t worry about anything.”

“Yes. Thank you, Aunt Youluan.”

Shen Wuyi slowly stepped away, and Shenwu Youluan watched her back with a soundless sigh in her lips.

She did not know that the worry, sadness, and timidness in Shen Wuyi’s eyes had vanished the second she turned around.

All that lay beneath her drooping eyelids... was a calm resembling a pool of dead water.

“Youluan requests a meeting, supreme one.”

Shenwu Youluan set foot inside the dark, oppressive divine hall. Once she was suitably close to the curtains, she bowed and said, “I have great news, supreme one.”

“Speak.” It was such a short word, and yet it was impossibly shrill like metal tearing into metal.

For any other Kingdom of God, it was an unparalleled honor to be able to meet the Divine Regent.

Here in the Eternal Night Kingdom of god, it was like the worst nightmare the mind could conjure.

Shenwu Youluan held up a jade box. It opened to reveal the pure, dark light of an obsidian rock.

What sounded like heavy breathing affected the silence of the hall for a moment. Then, a storm raced out from behind the curtains and grabbed the jade box Shenwu Youluan was holding.

A trembling howl immediately came from the darkness, “A perfect... Obsidian Evil Removing Crystal!”

“Yes!” Shenwu Youluan declared immediately, “For the past years, we have searched the Six Kingdoms of God high and low for a perfect Obsidian Evil Removing Crystal, but they are all damaged in some way. However, Wuyi was lucky enough to encounter a Half-God obsidian beast during her venture into the Endless Fog.”

An obsidian beast wasn’t a profound beast that was corroded into an abyssal beast by abyssal dust. Instead, it was a pure abyssal beast that was created purely out of abyssal dust. However, such beasts could only be found deep within the Endless Fog, and they were extremely rare. Naturally, they were much stronger than a common abyssal beast of the same cultivation level.

An Obsidian Evil Removing Crystal could only be found in a high level obsidian beast.

“Wuyi surpassed the objective you set for her three times over, but she remained within the Endless Fog to hunt for the obsidian beast.”

“With Wuyi’s current cultivation, she can barely deal with an obsidian beast. If she struck too hard, there is a chance she might damage the abyssal crystal within. If she held back, then she would place herself in grave danger... Wuyi fought the obsidian beast for half a month straight and was seriously injured at least a dozen times. Only then did she finally manage to defeat it.”

Shenwu Youluan sighed. “Maybe it was thanks to Wuyi’s sincerity, but not only did the obsidian beast possess an Obsidian Evil Removing Crystal, it turned out to be flawless.”

“Wuyi had just extracted the crystal when I found her. However, she was gravely injured. Worried that she might not be able to prevent accidents in her state, she handed the crystal to me for safekeeping. As soon as we returned, she raced over to beg for your forgiveness despite her state.”

The only answer she got was oppressive silence.

Raising her head a little, Shenwu Youluan forced herself to continue, “With this, we have collected four of the six treasures mentioned in the ‘Secret Tome’. The day you may see the light again is near, supreme one.”

The Obsidian Evil Removing Crystal’s aura disappeared. Clearly, the Lightless Divine Regent had put it away.

“What are you waiting for? Send out the slaves and collect the remaining two treasures post-haste.”

The Lightless Divine Regent offered neither praise nor compliment. Her tone remained as cold as ever.

“As you command,” Shenwu Youluan responded and took a step backward. A hint of struggle appeared on her features, but she ultimately forced herself to say, “Supreme one, the reason Wuyi returned late is for the sake of the Obsidian Evil Removing Crystal. The previous treasures were found all thanks to her selfless, practically suicidal efforts as well. She truly views your life far greater than her—”

“Are you defending her?”

The raspy voice sounded cool this time, but it blew up Shenwu Youluan’s worry in an instant. “No, Youluan is just—”

“Ingrate!”

The curtain split open, and a shockwave struck Shenwu Youluan squarely in the face. 𝒇𝒓𝙚𝒆𝔀𝓮𝓫𝒏𝓸𝙫𝓮𝓵.𝓬𝙤𝙢

The sound of her cheek bones breaking resounded throughout the hall.

“There is nothing I hate more than betrayal, and what is the next step after disobedience? Betrayal! It doesn’t matter what their reason is, betrayal will not be forgiven! ”

Shenwu Youluan shivered as she knelt on the floor. She did not even dare to touch her wound as she pleaded, “Please calm down, supreme one. I should not have spoken without thought.”

“Get lost. Tell Wuyi that she is grounded, and that she isn’t allowed to take a single step outside!”

“As you wish, supreme one.” Shenwu Youluan slowly withdrew toward the door when suddenly, she recalled something and paused. “Supreme one, I have one more thing to report. As of late, there is a rumor circulating between the Endless Fog and the surrounding realms. They claim that a person who called themselves the ‘Fog Monarch’ had appeared at the Endless Fog...”

“You think such a trivial issue deserves my attention?! Get lost!”

Shenwu Youluan did not dare to say anything else. She retreated out of the door and left the divine hall.

Even after she left, she kept her head bowed for a very long time. She did not dare to look up because she was afraid that the Lightless Divine Regent would detect the hatred buried within her eyes with her terrifying senses.

The divine hall returned to silence, but the Obsidian Evil Removing Crystal’s presence reappeared not long after Shenwu Youluan left.

A withered palm was touching the shining crystal again and again. It felt almost greedy.

Beside her hand lay a thick, heavy book. The “Secret Tome.” It was surrounded by abyssal dust.

Shen Wuyi returned to her bedroom. It was cold and dark just like the divine hall. Despite being the Eternal Night Divine Daughter, there was no one to serve her or attend to her needs.

Her footsteps were slow. It was as if she measured every step she took with an instrument before taking it.

A moment later, she stopped in front of a bronze mirror and checked out her dim reflection in silence.

Who... am... I...?

My talent surpasses everyone I’ve ever met.

My heart and soul refuse to submit to anyone.

And my intelligence... to think it could be so mad...

How is it possible that someone like me possesses no past in this world?

She lifted her hand. Her fingers looked like they were sculpted out of jade, but lying at the tips of her perfect fingers was...

A ball of abyssal dust.

How... can I control abyssal dust?

Outside the door, a familiar presence closed in as a voice rang, “Can I come in, Wuyi?”

The abyssal dust at her fingertip disappeared, and her blank expression was dyed by weakness stemming from her injuries and a hint of sorrow once more, “Please enter, Aunt Youluan.”

Shenwu Youluan entered the room and quickly stepped over to Shen Wuyi’s side. After sweeping her aura gently past Shen Wuyi and relaxing a little, she said, “Wuyi, the supreme one wanted me to tell you that you are grounded for three months.”

“Ah?” Shen Wuyi looked up with a flash of surprise. “Is that... Mother’s punishment?”

“That’s right.” Shenwu Youluan nodded with a faint smile. “The supreme one is angry, but everyone can tell that you are fully devoted to Her. The supreme one Herself is aware of this. It’s just that She ultimately cannot tolerate any form of betrayal or disobedience. That is why she gave you this punishment.”

Shen Wuyi pressed her lips together and took a moment to control her feelings. Then, she said softly, “Ten lifetimes is not enough for Wuyi to repay Mother’s kindness. Wuyi is willing to accept any punishment so long as Mother is happy.”

“Foolish girl.” Shenwu Youluan gave her a pat on the arm. “I have brought you the supreme one’s message, so I shan’t disturb you any longer. Rest well.”

She turned away, eyes flashing with care and other complex feelings.

As soon as they got close to the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God, they could feel that the concentration of the abyssal dust was decreasing drastically.

From a distance, a barrier could be seen descending from seemingly the highest point of the sky to the entire kingdom, separating it from the rest of the world.

The isolation barrier of the Kingdom of God was completely different from all other Lands of the Living. It was because it was constructed using the power of a True God and could almost perfectly isolate abyssal dust. It made it so that the concentration of abyssal dust within the Kingdom of God was negligible.

Yun Che let out a sigh of admiration—a proper reaction for someone who saw a Kingdom of God for the first time.

They could have arrived at their destination over a month ago. However, everything would fall beyond their control as soon as they returned to reality. That was why Hua Caili dragged him on all sorts of side trips until they were approaching the final limit set by her Father, and they could not afford to delay their return any longer.

This was her homeland, and yet Hua Caili looked timid for the first time in her life.

"Are you afraid?” She turned around and looked at the man she had decided to live with for the rest of her life.

“A little,” Yun Che replied in a somewhat calm voice.

“Me too.” Hua Caili felt the comfort transmitted to her through his hand and tightened her grip.
