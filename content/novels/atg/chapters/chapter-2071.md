The three Heaven Breaker princes were already uncomfortable to begin with. Their faces turned a shade of blue and purple as soon as they heard Yun Che’s declaration.

So angry that he had to laugh, Hua Mengyu could not maintain his composure any longer and scoffed, “Where in the world did this level three Divine Master come from? Is he insane? I can’t imagine any other reason he would make such a ludicrous statement!”

If Hua Fuchen wasn’t here, he would have already flung the word “idiot” at Yun Che’s face with all the scorn he could muster.

“Hahahaha!” But Hua Fuchen was laughing with blazing eyes. “What an arrogant boy! If that is your wish, then so shall it be!”

“Wanxiao, Mengyu, Guiyuan! You will fight him together!”

A divine regent’s command must never be disobeyed, but none of the three princes were moving. “Father, this is…”

It was unbelievably difficult yet glorious to become a Half-God, and yet their Father was commanding them to tackle a mere level three Divine Master together??

Even if their prey were to die in a single strike, it would still be a stain upon their honor; a humiliation they could scarcely forget.

“That's an order!” Hua Fuchen’s voice abruptly turned harsh, causing all three princes to stiffen with fear and shock. “Not only that, you are not to hold back even a little! Otherwise, I will take it as insubordination!”

“Yes, Father!” All three princes responded at the same time. What else could they say when the divine regent’s power was pressing against their souls?

All three princes unleashed their profound energy, summoning a powerful, continuous shockwave at the center of the Sword Breaker Platform. Their gazes turned into swords, their profound auras turned into swords, and it felt like a million swords were suspended above one’s heart.

“Boy,” Hua Fuchen backed off while saying indifferently, “I heard that you are a master of the heavy sword. Show me.”

For some reason, Yun Che did not make a move. “The three princes are of noble origin, and the heavy sword is too forceful. I do not want to commit the grave sin of wounding them, so…”

He raised a hand and summoned a miniscule profound energy cyclone, “I will use this instead.”

Yun Che had made the most outrageous statement in the most respectful tone. To the three princes, it was almost the biggest humiliation they had ever suffered in their lives.

The three princes were wearing ugly faces in the first place, but now, they could not even maintain a mask of stoicism anymore. Everyone’s mouth was twitching to a certain degree.

Where in the Abyss did Father find such a madman, and why is he pitting him against us? Is he bored? Is that why he’s making amusement out of us?

Hua Fuchen’s expression remained unchanged. He ordered, “Unleash your swords!”

Shiiiing!!!

Three sword beams shot toward Yun Che like three world-piercing lightning bolts.

If Hua Fuchen hadn’t ordered them to go all out, they would never, ever have used their swords. The gulf between a Half-God and a Divine Master was such that their profound pressure alone could crush their opponent to bits.

In their vision and spiritual perception, Yun Che was clearly immobilized by their Half-God pressure. He did not move even when the sword beams were right in front of him.

Yun Che instantly shattered under the three attacks… but to the three princes’ surprise, they did not sense any feedback. All they saw was a shattered silhouette.

The trio turned around at the same time and saw that Yun Che was behind them. Even his posture hadn’t changed one bit.

“Star God’s Broken Shadow” Hua Wanxiao cried out in surprise, “You’re part of the Star and Moon Kingdom of God!”

Yun Che: “... ?!”

“Absolutely disgraceful!” Hua Fuchen yelled angrily. “How dare you hesitate and distract yourself in the middle of combat! Have you fed all those years of cultivation to the dogs?”

His rebuke was such that Hua Wanxiao nearly lost his nerve. Knowing better than to say another word, Hua Wanxiao’s sword let out a violent shriek and unleashed several hundred air-splitting sword beams in the direction his finger was pointing.

To his left and right, Hua Mengyu and Hua Guiyuan did not attack. Instead, they ripped apart hundreds of meters of space to lock Yun Che down.

They were three Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioners, and they had failed to annihilate a level three Divine Master in an instant. It was a humiliation they could not help but be furious about.

With this, they had completely locked down the space surrounding Yun Che. His movement skill could be ten times better than this, and he still wouldn’t be able to escape their attack.

Yun Che still did not move a muscle. He waited until the attack was in front of him before his eyes finally erupted with violent profound light.

Hell Monarch, open!

It was as if a star had suddenly gone supernova right before their eyes. The wind blades blown up by the three princes’ swords instantly transformed into a terrifying storm that desired to destroy the world.

The three sword beams carrying the might of a Half-God were instantly broken and disintegrated by the sudden storm of profound energy. Even their bodies were flung back as if they had been struck by the hammer of heavens.

The trio landed unceremoniously on the floor at the same time. When they looked up again, it was with pure, unbridled astonishment and disbelief. They stared at Yun Che as if they were watching a supernatural being that should not exist.

Yun Che was still giving off the aura of a level three Divine Master, but the pressure that accompanied this aura actually sat on their internal organs like a million mountains and gripped their souls like the devil’s grasp. They were three Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioners, for heavens’ sake! How was this possible?

At the same time, Hua Fuchen’s eyes had finally lost their indifference as well. He stared fixedly at Yun Che, and for a few instants, he actually could not believe his own spiritual perception.

The aura of Divine Master, but the pressure of Divine Extinction!?

The tall tale he heard from Hua Qingying was real? A ludicrous person like this actually existed!?

“Attack!” Hua Fuchen growled.

He wanted to see with his own eyes if the power and pressure that shouldn’t belong to a Divine Master’s aura at all were real. Perhaps it was just a bubble; an illusion that would expose itself at the first prodding.

This time, there was no longer any reluctance or scorn on Hua Wanxiao’s face. He held out his hand, and a dark blue sword gently floated above his finger like a feather.

There was a soft ringing. The body followed the sword, and the sword followed the heart. When he leaped into the air, he slowly turned transparent until he seemingly merged into his sword and transformed into a dark blue sword beam. It then started stabbing toward Yun Che seemingly at a slow speed while following a bizarre trajectory.

At the same time, Hua Mengyu and Hua Guiyuan made their moves and created two identical sword formations in no time. Once the sword formations had taken form, they merged seamlessly into one and spread out into a white curtain of swords spanning dozens of kilometers.

In the Abyss, the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God represented the peak of the way of the sword. Both its sword and its intent could change into anything and everything.

Hua Fuchen still couldn’t sense even a glimmer of seriousness or worry in Yun Che’s eyes.

His response toward Hua Wanxiao’s feather-like sword attack was to wave his hand. So casual was his movement that it did not look like a real response at all.

The next moment, his fingers made contact with the sword beam. Strangely, it did not emit any sound at all.

His fingers passed through the sword beam and tapped on the blade with unerring accuracy. Then, they slid across its surface and stripped off every layer of power from it. By the time his fingers had reached the handle, the blade had lost all of its dark blue radiance.

Hua Wanxiao’s pupils dilated to the max. He was so shocked that he nearly lost his nerve. It was because he had somehow, someway, lost his connection to his beloved sword.

The next moment, he felt five fingers grabbing his wrist like a phantom.

An unbelievable amount of strength erupted from his wrist, and he found himself sailing through the air at high speed and spinning round and round like a top.

Hua Wanxiao’s sword flew out of his grip, and Yun Che caught it with casual ease. The sword burst into flames, and Yun Che spun around and jumped straight toward the terrifying screen of swords the two princes had created together, his charge accompanied by a piercing phoenix’s cry.

There was a fiery explosion, and a hole appeared in the sword screen containing the full power of the two princes instantly. The next moment, the many sword silhouettes were swiftly devoured by the crimson flames until the entire sky was on fire. For someone who didn’t know better, they would think that the sword silhouettes were dry wood.

The destruction of the sword screen caused the two princes to let out a painful groan and turn bloodless in the blink of an eye. A moment ago, they were overflowing with endless sword intent. Now, all that sword intent had turned into shock.

Once again, a ripple appeared in Hua Fuchen’s eyes. He growled, “Sword union!”

The three princes were shocked, but they obeyed his order without question. Hua Wanxiao arrested his momentum in mid-air and summoned his dark blue sword back into his hand. Hua Mengyu and Hua Guiyuan also moved into position and, together with Hua Wanxiao, assumed an odd triangular formation.

“Show me your sword, boy.” Hua Fuchen said indifferently, “Show me how high your sword can reach.”

Yun Che watched the three princes. He did not respond.

The three princes’ eyes began shining with the same sword light. Their sword hearts became connected, and their sword intent and sword energies merged into one.

A cry escaped their lips, and the three princes attacked at the same time. Their swords dashed forward and refracted what looked like a sea of sword beams.

Each sword beam seemed to possess a different and unique silhouette. It looked both true and false, real and unreal. It was enough to instantly confuse one’s vision and throw one’s spiritual perception into disarray.

Yun Che frowned a little but paid the rapidly approaching sea of swords no heed.

He made a grabbing motion, and the Heaven Smiting Devil Slayer Sword manifested into existence. He slowly pointed its tip toward the floor.

Doesn’t matter how many transformations you have…

All I need… is one sword!

The Heaven Smiting Devil Slayer Sword attacked. One moment there was nothing, and the next the earth split open, and the heaven recoiled in fear!

The terrifying, explosive power existed for only an instant, but it was enough to shock the True God, Hua Fuchen.

BOOOOOOOOM—————————!!

“WAHHHHHHHHHH!!”

The three princes’ gorgeous and bizarre sword silhouettes instantly shattered like fragile stones. A deafening roar filled their consciousness, a throaty scream escaped their lips, and their bodies slammed into the Sword Breaker Platform’s barrier with unbelievable speed, bounced off, and hit the ground like cannon balls.

The Heaven Smiting Devil Slayer Sword disappeared, and Yun Che said apologetically, “Since it was senior divine regent’s order, I had no choice but to use my sword. I apologize for my transgression, Your Highnesses.”

Thang! Thang! Thang!

The princes’ swords landed on different spots of the platform loudly.

It took a while before Hua Wanxiao, Hua Mengyu and Hua Guiyuan were able to climb back to their feet, but none of them had bothered to reclaim their favorite sword immediately. Instead, they were all staring at Yun Che blankly; watching the level three Divine Master who should not even deserve their gaze with shock and fear.

“...” Hua Fuchen let out a long breath. Then, he side-eyed the location where Hua Qingying was “hiding.”

He thought that Hua Qingying had exaggerated some of the young man’s feats considering how much she favored him. But now that he had witnessed his prowess with his own eyes, he had to admit that his cognition as a True God for ten thousand years… was completely ripped to shreds.

Unheard of, unseen power that did not exist in cognition, legends or records.

He… and the mysterious master he spoke of… who on earth…

“Who… on earth are…” Hua Wanxiao squeezed through his lips, but blood poured out of his mouth before he could finish his question. He fell to one knee.

He was a Half-God prince, and a level three Divine Master had injured him in one strike. One strike! How could this have happened?

How could he be just a level three Divine Master?!

“Wanxiao, Mengyu, Guiyuan,” Hua Fuchen said, “you may return to your abodes. Speak to no one about what happened today. No one .”

“Yes… we’ve already forgotten about today’s matter, Father.”

The three princes took their leave, but right before they passed through the exit, they all turned around at the same time and shot Yun Che a shocked, fearful look.

After the three princes were gone, the barrier split open, and Hua Caili descended from above like a beautiful butterfly. She embraced Yun Che and blinked proudly at her father. “You were shocked, weren’t you Father?”

That was exactly right, but seeing how close his daughter was with the boy, he could only muster an emotionless grunt.

“With this, he has passed the second test as well,” Hua Qingying’s voice came from another direction.

Hua Fuchen turned around to meet her gaze. “No wonder you praise this boy so. He really is quite unusual. I am really starting to wonder who on earth his master is.”

Yun Che immediately bowed his head. “My apologies, but master told me—”

“I get it. You don’t need to explain yourself.” Hua Fuchen waved him off. “I know that you respect your master deeply, so much so that you are unwilling to share his secret even with Caili. Naturally, I don’t expect you to make an exception for me.”

“Father, big brother Yun completed your trial three times over!” Hua Caili interrupted before anyone could say anything, the joy and pride in her eyes threatening to spill out of her eyes. It was as if she was trying to say: Look, Father! My man is amazing, isn’t he?!

“Now, there is only one last trial. Tell us what it is already!”

Hua Qingying turned to look. She too was curious about the last trial Hua Fuchen had prepared for Yun Che.

Instead of answering, Hua Fuchen turned away and said, “Tomorrow.”

He did not explain what he meant by that. He did not wait for anyone to respond either. By the time Hua Caili opened her mouth, he was already flying away.

“Hmph! Father must not have thought of a third trial yet.” Hua Caili grabbed Yun Che’s arm and said, “Pay him no mind. Big brother Yun, let me show you our sword collection. I’m sure you’ll be dazzled by them.”

Yun Che obeyed and followed Hua Caili to the Sword Collection Pavilion beneath the Sword Breaker Platform.

“You seem rather excited,” Li Suo suddenly spoke up.

“Is it that obvious?” Yun Che responded.

“Why are you excited?” Li Suo asked.

“The first two trials are just add-ons. In fact, they’re kinda sloppy if you think about it,” Yun Che explained indifferently. “This so-called last trial is Hua Fuchen’s true objective.”

“Is it the ‘step’ you said he would surely take?”

“That’s right.” Yun Che’s eyes glittered with indecipherable intent. “Tomorrow, he will send me to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God in the name of a trial.”

“The most critical step of my plan is about to come true. That’s why I decided to reward myself with some excitement.”

A long silence as Li Suo seemingly fell into deep thought. In the end though, she had to ask, “How on earth did you arrive at this conclusion?”

“Your confusion is perfectly understandable. You’ve never been a parent after all.” Yun Che said slowly, “All I did was put myself in Hua Fuchen’s shoes and imagine that Caili was Wuxin. Then, I threw Hua Fuchen and the current situation of the Kingdoms of God into the equation and calculated accordingly… If I am a man who loves my daughter more than my own life, what should I first remove before I resolve myself to make the big compromise? The most likely answer is obvious.”

“Before I entered the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God, my understanding of Hua Fuchen only existed in rumors and stories. I wasn’t sure that I could do it. But now, that possibility has basically become a certainty.”

After Hua Fuchen returned to his bedroom, he laid down a barrier that cut him off from the outside world.

He sat quietly for a very long time. In the end, he raised his hand.

There was a flash of divine light, and a silhouette slowly appeared in front of him.

The silhouette was a rather handsome middle-aged man. He was wearing a set of silver robes with twisted, conflicting and bizarre-looking divine runes sewn to the fabric.

Although it was just a silhouette, the man still gave off an intimidating pressure. His eyes especially looked like swamps or pools of fog, circulating with demonic light that came from the deepest ends of dreams.

“Yo, brother Fuchen,” the man called out. Surprisingly, his imposing, dignified face cracked a gentle smile. “What has happened that you are using such a projection to contact me?”

“Brother Meng,” Hua Fuchen said seriously, “I have a humble request for you.”

The man looked surprised at first. Then, he burst out laughing, “Hahaha! Don’t say it like that. We are brothers, aren’t we? Whatever your difficulty may be, just tell me about it, and I will see it resolved.”
