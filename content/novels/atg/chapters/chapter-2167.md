The Vermilion Bird Flames¹ continued to burn, not only showing no signs of ceasing but growing even more intense, as if intent on forging the entire firmament of the Pure Land² into a deep crimson glow. Even the light of the heavens was dyed by these divine flames, transforming into flowing patterns of fiery gold. As the eighth drop of Origin Blood³ condensed between her withered fingers, the voice of Divine Attendant Sushan⁴ was completely engulfed by the fiery light... Yet, Divine Official Lingxian's⁵ hand remained outstretched, and in her palm, the ninth drop of divine blood was condensing.

How terrifying was the Vermilion Bird True God's⁶ fiery breath? At this moment, any other person would have long since lost all spiritual perception and had their mind overwhelmed.

Yun Che, however, clearly perceived the immense divine aura contained within the nine drops of divine blood before him... These were by no means ordinary Vermilion Bird essence blood; rather, they originated from the Vermilion Bird's very essence, rooted in the core of its lifeblood, a source divine blood with absolutely no possibility of regeneration. Moreover, each loss was accompanied by a reduction in lifespan. It was a true sacrifice, harming oneself to bestow upon another.

The flames on her body grew increasingly gentle, but the fiery abyss in Divine Official Lingxian's eyes dimmed layer by layer. Yun Che opened his mouth several times, forcing out words against the True God's fiery breath: "Senior... no... you must not..."

He and Divine Official Lingxian had only just met. He didn't know what virtue or ability he possessed to receive such a profound gift from her. If it were merely to perpetuate the Vermilion Bird Flames, a single drop of such fundamental essence blood would have been more than enough!

Divine Official Lingxian paid him no heed, and the ninth drop of Vermilion Bird divine blood fully condensed between her fingers.

Finally, her hand moved. Her five fingers slowly closed, and after a brief pause, her index finger suddenly extended, touching Yun Che's glabella. Instantly, the world before Yun Che transformed into an boundless crimson sea of flames. A powerful, ancient, yet incredibly warm current slowly flowed throughout his entire body. His flesh, profound veins⁷, and soul sea were all bathed in a splendid and warm crimson glow, dispelling all physical pain and incinerating all negative emotions. It was a sense of peace he had never experienced since stepping into the Abyss⁸, making him involuntarily want to sink into it, to comfortably slumber in this divine warmth.

Amidst the endless warmth and peace, he caught a faint glimpse of longing. At this moment, he suddenly understood why Divine Official Lingxian had allowed her appearance to age, and why she had bestowed upon him such an exaggerated grace. Three million years of infatuated longing and steadfast devotion, yet her figure had never been reflected in Mo Su's⁹ lightless eyes. Even if her divine姿¹⁰ were a hundred or a thousand times more magnificent, it was destined to never stir even the slightest ripple in his gaze... Thus, her soul gradually despaired, her countenance withered, and her lifespan was nearing its end. Now, a person had appeared in the world who could stir his emotions and fix his gaze... So, let her Vermilion Bird Flames burn within this person, replacing her companionship and continuing her vigil. Compared to the inheritance of the Vermilion Bird Flames, perhaps this was the "fulfillment of her wish" she spoke of.

Another clear, long cry echoed through heaven and earth, awakening Yun Che's consciousness from the warm sea of flames. He opened his eyes, and the world before him rapidly shed its fiery golden halo. The Vermilion Bird divine phantom, with its wings spanning ten thousand miles, seemed to have had its soul drawn out. The fiery glass brilliance flowing over its feathers began to dim layer by layer, like a burnt-out sunset losing its last vibrant hue.

There were no longer any falling sparks at the tips of its tail feathers. When the long cry that pierced the sky completely faded into the distance, the blazing Vermilion Bird divine phantom instantly disintegrated, transforming into countless tiny fiery fragments that spread across the sky as a myriad of crimson light points with the gentle breeze, like a galaxy pouring down, or like fireflies bidding farewell to dusk.

The surging crimson glow in front transformed into layers of light gauze, slowly torn apart by an invisible wind, revealing Divine Official Lingxian beneath the dissipated divine phantom. Her face was pale, but a gentle, faint smile still graced her lips.

"Master!!"

Sushan stumbled forward, supporting Divine Official Lingxian's tottering divine body. Her normally elegant and unblemished face had also lost all color, just like Divine Official Lingxian's. "Master, why... why go to such lengths?"

"No need to worry."

There was no loss in Divine Official Lingxian's smile, only a faint sense of relief and satisfaction. "It's merely the loss of seventy percent of my remaining lifespan. The remaining thirty percent, for him... is already enough."

"..." Divine Attendant Sushan's eyes instantly welled with tears, and she was speechless for a long time.

Yun Che didn't have time to feel the Vermilion Bird blood within his body. He rose and bowed deeply. "Junior Yun Che thanks Senior Lingxian for your immense grace."

"No need to thank me."

She patted Sushan's hand, and with Sushan's support, slowly took a step forward. Her increasingly cloudy Vermilion Bird divine eyes re-examined Yun Che. "This is the repayment I owe you, and also the best destination for the Vermilion Bird Flames."

She pointed a finger, and a jade slip¹¹ glowing with crimson crystal flames appeared before Yun Che, then floated into his hand.

"This score is named... the 'Vermilion Bird Soul-Soothing Melody'¹². When others read it, it is merely a musical score for purifying the mind and cleansing thoughts. But when played with Vermilion Bird Flames, it can ignite divine sounds and ultimate flames capable of soothing souls and redeeming the world!"

The name "Vermilion Bird Soul-Soothing Melody" was something Yun Che had heard of even in the lower realms. It, along with the "Golden Crow World-Burning Record"¹³ and the "Phoenix World-Praising Canon"¹⁴, were known as the Three Great World-Burning Heavenly Books. The moment the "Vermilion Bird Soul-Soothing Melody" fell into his hands, it meant that the inheritances of the three ancient supreme flame systems had all converged within his body.

The moment the crimson crystal jade slip fell into Yun Che's hand, it unfolded on its own. The score of the Vermilion Bird Soul-Soothing Melody clearly appeared in Yun Che's eyes, and in his ears was Divine Official Lingxian's soul-penetrating divine voice.

"The Vermilion Bird Soul-Soothing Melody contains eight movements. The first four are [Ode to Fiery Dawn]¹⁵, [Peaceful Soul Interlude]¹⁶, [Flame of Calamity's End]¹⁷, and [Chirp of the Bird's Heart]¹⁸. These four movements are relatively easy to comprehend. With your profound veins and pure heart, your speed of comprehension will surely surpass Sushan's back then."

"The latter three movements are [Heavenly Plume Compassionate Voyage Melody]¹⁹, [Vermilion Cloud Rebirth Ballad]²⁰, and [Ashen Calamity Pitying Life Melody]²¹. The first two not only require sufficient integration of the Vermilion Bird Flames with your own body and extremely high comprehension, but also a compassionate heart that pities heaven and earth."

"As for the seventh movement, it requires perfect flame control, ultimate comprehension, a saintly heart, and an unblemished soul. Sushan has cultivated for ten thousand years and still cannot ignite it; there is no need to force it."

Yun Che listened quietly. When Divine Official Lingxian's voice fell, he closed the jade slip and solemnly put it away. "Senior's teachings, junior will engrave every word in my heart. Senior just mentioned that the Vermilion Bird Soul-Soothing Melody contains eight movements... Could it be that the eighth movement has been lost?"

"No,"

Divine Attendant Sushan answered him. "The final movement of the Vermilion Bird Soul-Soothing Melody, named [Aria of World Redemption]²², can only be played by Master, but..."

She didn't continue, but Yun Che fully understood. It turned out that the eighth movement was none other than the Flame of World Redemption, one of the three ultimate flames alongside the Phoenix's Nirvana Flame and the Golden Crow's Jade-Shattering Flame... It was the ultimate flame that could only be ignited at the moment of one's demise.

"Cough... cough cough!" Divine Official Lingxian suddenly let out a violent cough, accompanied by the painful trembling of her divine body. Divine Attendant Sushan quickly reached out, blocking the constant gush of bloody foam from her mouth.

Yun Che instinctively stepped forward. "Senior..."

Divine Official Lingxian, however, waved her hand, comforting him instead. "No need to worry about me. Eternal slumber, for an old woman like me who should have died three million years ago, is a longed-for release. The Primordial Flame Crystal²³ you gave me allows my last thousand years of remaining life to be free from the torment of body-devouring pain; that is already a great kindness."

A thousand years of remaining life... Yun Che's heart stirred violently. Divine Official Lingxian, one of the four Divine Officials of the Pure Land, whose existence almost spanned the entire history of the Abyss World... after bestowing upon him the Vermilion Bird inheritance, she actually only had a mere thousand years of lifespan remaining.

"If you truly harbor feelings of gratitude that are hard to let go of, then concentrate and listen to my three pieces of advice."

Yun Che stood upright, then bowed with utmost respect. "Yes, junior will listen to every word of Senior's advice with utmost reverence."

"Cough... cough cough..."

Divine Official Lingxian's already aged face visibly withered further. She paused for a few breaths before softly saying, "Since you possess the profound veins of Lord Ni Xuan²⁴, and also the Phoenix Flames and Golden Crow Flames, you should know the destructive power of the three divine flames: the Golden Crow Flames are the strongest, the Phoenix Flames are second, and the Vermilion Bird Flames are the weakest."

"But the Vermilion Bird Flames are universally known as the foremost of the three divine flames. Do you... know why?"

Yun Che replied, "Although the Vermilion Bird Flames are not adept at incinerating living beings, they can warm and soothe the soul, burn away impurities, and suppress all evil. They are praised by all worlds and revered by all spirits; they are truly worthy of being the foremost of the three divine flames."

Divine Official Lingxian smiled and nodded. "Good, very good. The 'Eternal Pure Land'²⁵ was originally my homeland, but I am destined to never return. My first piece of advice... if you are able to reach the 'Eternal Pure Land' in the future, remember that the Vermilion Bird Flames can only soothe souls, and must not be used for evil."

A thousand years of remaining life... yet destined to never return??

Yun Che felt puzzled, but naturally couldn't ask at this moment. He could only respond with utmost solemnity, "Yes! Junior hereby vows that in this life, I will never use..."

"No need to vow."

Divine Official Lingxian interrupted him. "Compassion lies in the heart, not in words or actions. Your promise is enough."

"My second piece of advice..."

She looked at Yun Che, her gentle gaze truly like that of a mother looking at her child. "The nine drops of divine blood I gave you are taken from my Vermilion Bird origin, condensing a bit of my origin divine power. For an ordinary person, fully refining them would be enough to directly achieve demigod status. As for how much they can help you grow, with Lord Ni Xuan's profound veins, I cannot determine. But..."

"No matter what, do not be too hasty. Remember to refine at most one drop every three years. Never try to achieve it all at once. Otherwise, a minor loss of divine origin is one thing, but harming yourself... might leave an irreparable eternal regret." To Yun Che, the risks Divine Official Lingxian spoke of simply wouldn't exist.

But he could only obediently comply. "Yes, although junior has an endless yearning for the Vermilion Bird divine flames, senior's grace is such that wasting even a tiny bit would be an unforgivable sin. Junior will proceed cautiously, refining them slowly, and will absolutely not rush for success."

What he said was not empty talk. But as for the extent of his "cautious steps" and "slow refining," that was naturally for him to decide. "Good." Divine Official Lingxian nodded again. Her normally steady breathing now became noticeably shallow and rapid, each inhale accompanied by an unmistakable slight tremor, like a flickering candle in the wind. Even her crimson glow dress seemed to have lost its luster. The hem swayed gently with the breeze, but no longer possessed the previous ethereal quality of the Vermilion Bird's fiery shadow. Instead, due to her master's weakness, it gained a heavy, drooping sensation.

Only the gaze from her cloudy eyes towards Yun Che still held the same gentleness. "Child, have you ever heard of the 'Pale Flames'²⁶ from your master?"

Yun Che nodded. "The Ancestral Creator²⁷ once left behind three calamities and three boons, and the 'Pale Flames' were one of the three calamities, eventually annihilated by Master."

Although, this was actually something Lisha²⁸ had only told him the day before.

"You do know, that's for the best."

Divine Official Lingxian's breathing became increasingly unstable, and the hand supporting Sushan also began to tremble slightly, but she still spoke in a peaceful voice. "Since you know of the Pale Flames, you should naturally also know its ultimate fate: its core source was disintegrated by Lord Ni Xuan, transforming into three fragments, bestowed upon our Vermilion Bird, Phoenix, and Golden Crow clans."

"And this third piece of advice is... cough cough... you must never, because of the legend of these 'Pale Flames,' attempt to fuse the three divine flames of the Vermilion Bird, Phoenix, and Golden Crow."

"Why...?"

Given Divine Official Lingxian's current tottering state, it would have been most appropriate to simply agree and let her rest sooner, but he still instinctively blurted out the question.

The red jade hairpin holding her hair seemed unable to support her graying strands; a few locks of hair slipped from beside the hairpin, hanging down the sides of her cheeks, slightly obscuring the cloudiness in her eyes. She lowered her gaze and gave Yun Che a sufficiently clear answer. "Lord Ni Xuan was born for the elements and feared no fire in heaven or earth, yet even he dared not ignite the Pale Flames within himself."

"Because once those Pale Flames ignite, they will spontaneously generate violent flame spirits."

"Even if it is a flame ignited by your power, its flame spirit will absolutely not obey your will, but will only possess the instinct to incinerate, burning both self and foe, wantonly causing unpredictable and uncontrollable terrifying flame disasters."

Yun Che: "..."

"However... the main reason you must not attempt it is not this."

"The Pale Flames are a calamitous fire that can easily burn through even a True God's body. They were a world-shaking disaster even in the Age of Gods, let alone in the current era... cough... cough cough... it is even more impossible, and should not, burn within a living being of this age..."

"If you forcibly attempt it out of curiosity and desire... it is highly likely to destroy yourself... the consequences... are hard... to predict... cough cough cough..."

"Master, don't speak anymore!"

Sushan could no longer remain silent. She tightly supported her tottering body. When she touched her arm, she felt only a chilling coldness; even her skin, which usually carried the residual warmth of the Vermilion Bird, was as cold as an ancient jade that had lost its divine aura.

Yun Che quickly said, "Junior has remembered all that Senior has said; not a single word will be forgotten."

"Senior, please rest peacefully and be kind to yourself. Junior will not disturb you further and bids farewell."

Sushan had no time to speak. With a flick of her long sleeve, a gentle breeze swept past Yun Che, causing ripples in space. As his vision blurred, he was already outside Divine Official Lingxian's residence. He didn't leave immediately, standing rooted to the spot, filled with endless emotion and an almost unreal sense of bewilderment.

"She actually gave you such a heavy gift."

Lisha also let out a sigh. "'Genuine smiles'... are they truly that important and precious??"

Yun Che turned and slowly walked away. "You haven't experienced three million years of waiting and infatuated longing, so you wouldn't understand."

"I... indeed don't understand."

Lisha murmured, "Mo Su is obsessed with love, so he should understand Lingxian's feelings for him. Why then... was he unwilling to even grant her a smile?"

Yun Che replied, "Because love between a man and a woman is the most selfish thing."

Lisha became even more confused. "If love between a man and a woman is the most selfish thing, then why do you have so many wives and concubines, and confidantes..."

"Shut up!"

Yun Che's tone was firm. "Don't disturb my thoughts."

Lisha was silent for a moment. Gradually, she sensed the gravity of Yun Che's thoughts and spoke again. "Receiving such a rich Vermilion Bird divine origin will not only allow you to ignite the Vermilion Bird Flames, but after fully refining it, it will be enough for you to achieve several times the growth you've had in the four years since entering the Abyss, in a short period."

"Why is your mood more solemn than joyful?"

Yun Che's brows furrowed slightly, unable to relax for a long time. "In another forty-odd years, the passage to the 'Eternal Pure Land' will open, and Divine Official Lingxian still has a thousand years of lifespan remaining, yet she says she is destined to never set foot in the 'Eternal Pure Land'..."

"She... doesn't want to return??"

"That shouldn't be the case."

Yun Che shook his head. "To her, that is her homeland. She would only yearn to return far more than anyone in the Abyss. Moreover, at the end of one's life, shouldn't one yearn even more to rest in their homeland..."

"Brother Yun!!" A distant shout interrupted Yun Che's thoughts. In his line of sight, Hua Caili²⁹ fluttered gracefully like a flawless jade butterfly, arriving by his side.

"Caili? Why are you here?" Yun Che's eyes shone with surprise.

Hua Caili intimately and naturally hugged his arm, her soft body leaning against his. Her eyebrows curved into a beautiful crescent. "Divine Son Xi³⁰ said you were with Granny Lingxian, so I came to find you. Come with me to a place quickly."

"Huh? Where to?"

A gentle breeze brushed his ear, and he was already being lightly pulled along by Hua Caili. "You'll know soon enough."
