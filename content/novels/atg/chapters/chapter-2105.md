Although he couldn’t see Li Suo’s expression, her puzzlement was as clear as day.

“Nothing, I’m just talking nonsense.” Yun Che immediately straightened his expression. A second later, he suddenly said, “You truly are an unlucky woman. Of all the people you could have fallen with, it just had to be me. As a result, you, the Creation Goddess of Life and the holiest, most life-loving existence in the entire world, have to commit grave sins with me in the Abyss.”

“If one day you recover all of your memories, I’m sure you won't be able to wait to smite me into light ashes with your Creation God powers.”

Li Suo’s hand paused for a moment, and she whispered, “I can vaguely remember some old acquaintances, but the one thing I cannot remember is my own appearance. And now... all of my emotions, recognition, and worldview come from you.”

“I have been lonely for a very long time, so I am afraid of loneliness. Your appearance is what freed me from a loneliness that felt like eternity. Therefore, I can tell that my soul is close and grateful toward you. But you, ever since you came to this world, the emptiness and loneliness in your soul has only been increasing day by—”

“Enough, enough, you don’t have to say any more.” Yun Che hurriedly silenced her. “I’m the Fog Monarch who astounded the entire Abyss, you know? Do you know how cool I am right now? I’m just experiencing a bit of loss, and you couldn’t even overlook that?”

“...” The profound light remained warm and gentle. Li Suo seemed to be deep in thought about something before she nodded. “I will learn to be better.”

“Mm...” Yun Che looked up with a bit of astonishment before breaking into a small smile. At the same time, the loneliness Li Suo was perceiving seemed to be lessened somewhat. “I think... not a single person since the beginning of time has ever seen such an obedient Creation God.”

Li Suo: “...”

It was at this moment Yun Che suddenly narrowed his eyes and sat up.

“Our ‘prey’ has finally shown up.”

Northern Divine Region, Yama Realm, Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness.

This place was as dark as ever. Even after Yun Che had removed all of its Devil Crystals of Eternal Darkness, the dark aura of this place remained the richest of the entire Primal Chaos.

It had been several hours since Chi Wuyao came here. None of her Witches were by her side. In front of her was a black stele that she had almost never let out of her sight in recent times.

Suddenly, the barrier she placed around her was violently ripped open, and a pale, unblemished ankle stepped into Chi Wuyao’s view. The Devil Queen looked up and asked in a somewhat helpless voice, “For what reason have you left your post and come to me again, Brahma Heaven God Emperor?”

Qianye Ying’er was about to answer when Chi Wuyao interrupted her, “Don’t even try. I haven’t heard anything from him. You should know that it is impossible for him to send anything home.”

“But...” Qianye Ying’er refused to give up. “Didn’t you say you gave him a portion of your Nirvana Devil Emperor Soul? It's the soul of a Devil Emperor. Maybe...”

“I’m sorry, but no.” Chi Wuyao cruelly stamped out Qianye Ying’er’s almost pitiful hope.

Her expectations extinguished, Qianye Ying’er immediately became far more irritated and gloomier than before. She cast a look at the stele standing in front of Chi Wuyao once before grumping, “You came all the way to the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness just to see this broken stele? You’ve tried for so long already. If it’s really hiding a secret, you would have discovered it a long time ago.”

Chi Wuyao shook her head. “My Nirvana Devil Emperor Soul may not be able to form a connection with it, but it can sense that it is hiding something. In recent times, I have tried dozens of methods and even moved it to different environments, all to no avail.”

Qianye Ying’er crossed her arms in front of her chest and said uncaringly, “Just because you found it where you obtained your Nirvana Devil Emperor Soul does not mean it's necessarily related to the Nirvana Devil Clan. If you really must find an answer, you can try... breaking it.”

“If it works, then hurray. If not, you don’t have to worry about it any longer.”

“I knew you couldn’t come up with anything useful.” A small smile crept onto Chi Wuyao’s lips. “You are right that it most likely isn’t an item belonging to the Nirvana Devil Clan. The fact that the name ‘Pan Xiaodie’ is engraved on it is proof. What I cannot let go of is the fact that it was left behind at the Nirvana Devil Emperor Soul’s location despite not belonging to the Nirvana Devil Clan, and in such a pristine condition too.”

Suddenly, she looked up and stared at Qianye Ying’er with bright eyes.

Qianye Ying’er: “Hmm?”

“Qianying,” Chi Wuyao reached out and touched Qianye Ying’er’s finger. “Lend me your blood!”

Qianye Ying’er was puzzled, but she did not resist.

A bead of blood pooled at her fingertip. Chi Wuyao then splashed it against the dark stele.

Qianye Ying’er’s words had reminded her that she possessed the blood of the Devil Emperor Yun Che had given her back then.

The Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor possessed the purest dark profound energy out of the four devil emperors. Not only could her devil blood accommodate any dark profound energy, the “Calamity and Misfortune” cast using the Heaven Smiting Devil Blood could be used to amplify other dark energies as well. That included the three Devil Emperor’s dark energy.

The Nirvana Devil Emperor Soul might not be able to awaken this stele, but maybe Heaven Smiting Devil Blood could...

As soon as the bead of blood touched the stele, it immediately burst into thick, dark light.

“It worked!” Chi Wuyao whispered, eyes shining brightly as she had not held much hope that it would work in the first place. Qianye Ying’er’s lips were slightly parted in surprise as well.

The dark light circled around the stele for a very long time. Finally, something crumbled into nothing on the stele, and the profound light turned into an extraordinarily clear projection. It was a scene from untold years ago.

“A projection!?” Chi Wuyao and Qianye Ying’er exchanged a glance with each other. They both saw the astonishment and severity in each other’s eyes.

The land within the projection was a land of darkness. Even considering how much time had passed, they could still feel an intimidating, demonic might from it.

A woman in black dress appeared inside the projection. Her face could not be seen clearly, but judging from her figure and the infinitely noble aura she naturally exuded, no one doubted that she possessed a calamitous countenance.

Next, a man appeared inside the projection. He was wearing a blue robe. His hair was as dark as the night, and his eyes as deep as the abyss. He was extraordinarily handsome in a devilish way. When he looked up, his eyes shone with a kind of arrogance that towered over even heaven and earth, but it transformed into tranquil pools immediately after his gaze met the woman in the black dress.

The woman in the black dress stopped in her tracks and dropped to her knees.

The blue-robed man froze for an instant before his endless nobility and arrogance all transformed into panic and confusion, “Xiaodie, you... what are you doing?”

“Brother Nie, please... Please help me.” The woman sobbed with every word.

The blue-robed man strode up to her and tried to lift her to her feet, but the woman refused to stand. He grew even more panicked as he asked, “Stop... stop crying! What on earth happened? Whatever it is, I’ll help you, so get up already!”

The woman still refused to stand up though. It was because she knew just how selfish and wanton her request was. “The Heaven Punishing Divine Emperor, he... he’s planning to kill big brother Mo Su!”

The blue-robed man’s eyes shivered violently when he heard the name.

“The Heaven Punishing Divine Emperor is planning to sink big brother Mo Su into the Abyss of Nothingness with his own hands... he’s already announced this to the entire God Race. He is as stubborn as he is truthful. There is no way he would change his mind after making such an announcement.”

“Just now, the Heaven Punishing Divine Emperor has taken big brother Mo Su to the Abyss of Nothingness! He will die... he’s really going to die...”

The woman’s voice was brimming with marrow-deep pain.

The eyes of the blue-robed man grew discolored as he replied powerlessly, “That is the God Race’s business. Besides, you know how powerful the Heaven Punishing Divine Emperor is. No one can stop him if he wishes to execute his own son. Besides, this is a...”

He wanted to say that this was a good thing for the Devil Race since Mo Su was the strongest god of the younger generation of the God Race, and the two races had been enemies since ancient times, but... he could not possibly say such cruel words to the woman who was already suffering so much.

“No! There is still a way to save him!”

Still kneeling, the woman clutched the blue-robed man’s clothes and cried, “Big brother Nie, please lend me your ‘Nirvana Devil Wheel Reversing Pearl’. I only need it for a moment. I have the Original Nether Void Breaching Mirror. If I freeze the wheel of time temporarily with the pearl and pierced the void with the mirror, then I can save big brother Mo Su even from the clutches of the Heaven Punishing Divine Emperor.”

The blue-robed man swayed on his feet before crying, “Xiaodie, have you... have you gone insane?! Do you even know what you’re talking about?!”

“This is the Heaven Punishing Divine Emperor we’re talking about! The strongest champion of the God Race! The Creation God that could least tolerate us out of all the Creation Gods! Do you know what will happen if you fail? Do you know what the consequences might be if the Nether Mirror and the Devil Pearl were to fall into the God Race’s hands? You will become the eternal sinner of the Devil Race... all for the sake of a mere God Race prince!”

“I... have gone insane... but... but...”

Drip drip...

Despite having happened untold years ago, the sound of her tears was still so clear that it broke one’s heart. “He is my Mo Su... I can’t... I can’t watch him die... I can’t...”

The blue-robed man’s eyes were dazed.

The Pan Xiaodie he was familiar and in love with boasted a toughness and arrogance that towered over all men. Even her temper was as violent and fiery as a devilish flame.

Today, she was weeping so sorrowfully in front of him... for a man from the God Race.

“You should really... beg your father for help...” The blue-robed man’s voice gradually turned painful. 𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝕨𝕖𝗯𝚗𝚘𝕧𝕖𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝕞

The woman in black dress shook her head immediately. “Father does not want us to be together to begin with... he would never agree to this... he even went so far as to try and lock me up. Without the Nether Mirror, I would not have been able to escape, and there would be no chance for me to save Mo Su...”

“Since you know he disapproves, what can you do... even if you managed to save him?”

The woman in black dress murmured, “I promised him that we would work together to break any shackles, overcome any trial if the world accepts our union. If not... then we will escape this world, seek out and build a paradise that belongs to us and us alone.”

The blue-robed man wobbled.

“I... will take him back to the Devil Race. If neither father nor the Devil Race can tolerate him, then I will... remove his divine powers so he may never threaten the Devil Race. I will protect him forever and ever.”

“If still they cannot tolerate us... then we will dispel all our powers and vanish into a distant lower realm. We will find a paradise where no one can find us.”

The blue-robed man slowly closed his eyes. It was impossible to say if he was in pain or struggling.

The Nirvana Devil Wheel Reversing Pearl isn’t just the Nirvana Devil Race’s most powerful time devil artifact, it is the ultimate devil artifact that guarantees our race’s safety. No harm must come to it... and so I cannot give it to you no matter what.”

“Big brother Nie...”

“Don’t bother.” The blue-robed man abruptly turned away and uttered through gritted teeth, “I cannot!”

Although only her back could be seen, her aura withered so much that Chi Wuyao and Qianye Ying’er could almost imagine her eyes losing all of their color and light in an instant.

She knelt there in silence for a very long time. Finally, she climbed to her feet and said weakly, “I’m sorry, big brother Nie... It’s I who made a most unreasonable request... in the future, do make sure to take care of yourself. Do not repeat my mistake.”

She turned away to leave... but a hand caught her arm with a death grip.

“What are you doing?” The blue-robed man was almost snarling. “You think you can save him with the Nether Mirror alone?”

The woman’s voice was soft, but every word she spoke was infused with unbreakable determination. “If my other half lives, then I will live. If my other half dies, then I will die.”

“...” The blue-robed man looked away. It took him a long time to squash the deep pain in his eyes before he said, “I said I wouldn’t give you the devil pearl, but I never said that I wouldn’t help you.”

He raised his hand and summoned a devilish pearl surrounded by a strange black light. “You are not a member of my Nirvana Devil Race, so unlike me, you can just barely use the devil pearl. So, I’ll come with you.”

The woman in black dress stared at him blankly for a while. Finally, she closed her eyes and whispered, “Thank you, big brother Nie. A lifetime isn’t enough for me to repay the debt I owe you.”

Her tearful whisper entered the blue-robed man’s ears. The next moment, he flinched. It was because he realized that he could not move even a muscle. Even his profound energy was firmly locked within his body.

This was... the spatial shackle of the Original Nether Void Breaching Mirror!

“Xiaodie... what are you doing?!”

The woman in black dress reached out and took the devil pearl from his hand.

“Xiaodie... Xiaodie! Don’t be stupid!” The blue-robed man’s pupils dilated to the max. His voice was filled with infinite terror as well. “Let me go! I already promised to come with you! Let me go now!”

The woman in black dress slowly stepped back as she said in a sorrowful voice, “I know what I’m doing, but I cannot... no matter what... watch him fall into the Abyss of Nothingness and do nothing. This is our sin, and I cannot drag you down with me.”

She turned toward the projection and said, “This Projection Stone has engraved everything. Whether I succeed or fail, it will prove that I am the one who took the devil pearl from you. It has nothing to do with you.”

“I’ll come back very soon, big brother Nie... when that happens, big brother Mo Su and I will beg for your forgiveness together. We will receive any punishment.”

Her black sleeve cut a hole in space, and she stepped right through the gap. After she disappeared, the spatial gap disappeared as if it was never there.

“Xiaodie! Xiaodie! Someone... father... Elder Nie Yuan... Xiaodie is in danger... someone... someone head to the God Realm of Absolute Beginning and save Xiaodie!”

“Ahhhhhhh——!!!”

The projection ended with the Nirvana Devil Crown Prince’s despairing scream.

Chi Wuyao and Qianye Ying’er’s reactions greatly differed from each other.

“A lovesick fool and another lovesick fool.” Qianye Ying’er curled her lips seemingly in disdain. “I cannot believe the one thing that is perfectly preserved since ancient times is this utter—Hmm?”

It was at this moment she noticed Chi Wuyao’s strange look and frowned abruptly. “What did you discover, Devil Queen?”

Chi Wuyao let out a quiet sigh and said in a heavy voice, “Nether Mirror... Devil Pearl... To think that my initial assumptions all came true.”

She wondered how the Nirvana Devil Crown Prince felt when he sealed the projection into the stele.

“What came true? What are you saying?” Qianye Ying’er’s heart grew heavy before she knew it.

“I’m saying...” Chi Wuyao reached out and lightly brushed a finger across the three words “Pan Xiaodie”. “That his opponent is the son of a Creation God, one who wields the two most powerful devil artifacts in the world too.”

“...” Shock and horror slowly spread out in Qianye Ying’er’s eyes. She would not speak for a very, very long time.
