“That said, the news regarding the Lord of the Abyss isn’t completely useless. Their existence actually solved my biggest conundrum so far.”

“Your biggest... conundrum?"

Li Suo could not remember Yun Che ever mentioning such a thing.

“Li Suo,” Yun Che said very seriously, “Please utilize every piece of Creation God knowledge you’ve collected so far and answer this question of mine... Can you or any other Creation Gods you know ensure that a True God’s divine power is passed down without any loss whatsoever?”

Li Suo’s deliberation did not last too long. She answered succinctly, “No.”

“That’s right. The answer is no. This is the simplest form of common sense. If a True God’s divine power could be passed down to a non-divine body without any loss, then the ancient True Gods would not have ‘died’ for real. In fact, the gods, already standing at the pinnacle of the world, would have kept growing in number until they surpassed the mortals. Given enough time, they could have threatened even the natural law and order of the heavenly law.”

Li Suo finally understood what Yun Che meant by his “biggest conundrum”. Indeed, now that she realized the oddity, she could not stop thinking about it without feeling puzzled, shocked, and afraid.

“If even you, a Creation God, declared that the answer is no, then... how did Mo Su manage to create six artifacts of inheritance that could all allow a Godbearer to inherit the power of a True God?”

“This could only be possible... if he wasn’t the one who created the artifacts of inheritance!”

It was at this moment that Yun Che slammed face-first into Dugu Zhuyuan’s silver armor. He had been so engrossed in talking with Li Suo that he failed to react immediately. When he looked up in a hurry, he saw Dugu Zhuyuan facing toward a particular direction and performing a salute.

In the distance, a red figure could be seen moving swiftly across the sky. Yun Che felt a scorching hot aura rushing past his body, and the next moment, the red figure vanished into the thin, overlapping clouds.

During the brief contact, Yun Che clearly sensed his Phoenix bloodline and his Golden Crow bloodline throbbing at the same time.

Was that... High Priest Ling Xian?

After High Priest Ling Xian was gone, Dugu Zhuyuan finally straightened up and looked at Yun Che. “You seem distracted, Divine Son Yuan.”

Yun Che replied unhurriedly, “Do you roughly know where the ‘Forbidden Zone of Slumbering Gods’ is, senior Dugu?”

It wasn’t really a sensitive question, but Dugu Zhuyuan did not give him a clear answer either. “In a remote place. It’s connected to the Void Breaching Great Formation.”

“I see... If I enter, can the divine perception of the seniors of Dreamweaver follow me in? If possible, then they could safeguard me from accidents or save my life during dangerous times.”

Dugu Zhuyuan replied frankly, “The Forbidden Zone of Slumbering Gods contains extremely high concentrations of abyssal dust, making it very difficult for divine perception to extend. On top of that, it is isolated by a barrier constructed by the Abyssal Monarch Himself. No one’s divine perception can penetrate the barrier. If you are worried, then you do not need to enter.”

Yun Che: That is precisely what I want to hear.

Yun Che nodded with a straight face. “From the sounds of it, the Forbidden Zone of the Slumbering Gods is an extremely dangerous place, so why did the Eternal Night Divine Daughter persist in traveling there? Is it because enormous opportunities are hiding under the cover of the risks?”

Dugu Zhuyuan did not give him a clear answer. He said indifferently, “It is dangerous, but most of the entrants are Divine Children of the Kingdoms of God. Naturally, their safety is prioritized. The Pure Land will grant all entrants a method to protect themselves when it is time for them to enter.”

“You will know when it is time, Divine Son Yuan.”

It was at this moment that an ethereal but anxious voice hit them from afar. “Big Brother Yun!! Big Brother Yun!!!”

The voice was still echoing in their ears when the beautiful figure showed up.

Hua Caili grabbed Yun Che’s hands and looked him up and down with her starry eyes. She asked anxiously, “Are you okay, Big Brother Yun? Uncle Abyssal Monarch didn’t give you a hard time, did he?”

“Of course not.”

Yun Che smiled. “If the Abyssal Monarch truly wishes to give me a hard time, he simply needs to give the order. He would not have gone through the trouble of inviting me for a private audience.”

Worried that Yun Che was just consoling her, Hua Caili looked at Dugu Zhuyuan and interrogated him. “Uncle Dugu, Uncle Abyssal Monarch didn’t give Big Brother Yun a hard time, right?? You’re a noble and righteous man. You’re the strongest knight who never lies.”

Dugu Zhuyuan answered, “Do not worry, Li’l Caili. I swear in the name of Dugu that the Abyssal Monarch did not give Divine Son Yuan a hard time at all.”

When he finished, he gave Yun Che a complicated look. Hard time? More like...

“That’s good!”

Her grip tightened, and Hua Caili finally seemed to relax completely. She broke into a bright, charming smile and said, “In that case, allow me to share with you a piece of good news as well. Aunt said that she would fight you.”

Dugu Zhuyuan was usually as steady as a mountain, but the moment he heard this news, he abruptly stood straight as an arrow. At the same time, his body visibly shook with excitement and fighting spirit.

He said gratefully, “Thank you, Caili. This favor—”

Hua Caili hurriedly interrupted him, “Setting aside the favor, Aunt said that she has a condition.”

Dugu Zhuyuan replied immediately, “Do tell.”

“Aunt said that the loser of this fight must fulfill a request of the victor’s. So long as the request fits the way of heaven and morality, then the loser must fulfill the request. If you disagree... then she won’t fight you.”

“I accept!”

Dugu Zhuyuan did not hesitate for even an instant, and his already burning fighting spirit did not cool down in the slightest. “It’s only natural that the loser should meet a loser’s ending. Please inform the Sword Fairy that I’ll be waiting for her at the ‘Heaven Above Abyss’ after I open the gate to the Forbidden Zone of Slumbering Gods!”

Dugu Zhuyuan departed the scene as soon as his escort mission was complete. However, his terrible aura would remain embedded in this space for a long, long time, unfading. Yun Che could not help but let out a mental sigh: Aw man, if only I could turn him into my abyssal ghost.

“What are you talking about?” Hua Caili floated into the air and wrapped her arms around his neck so that the only thing they could see was each other’s eyes.

Yun Che replied wistfully, “I was thinking... that aunt is incredible.”

“Huh? Aunt?”

Yun Che enveloped his arms around her waist and pulled her seemingly frail and boneless body closer. “The reason she accepted this fight is that she’s trying to pave the path to our future in her own way.”

Hua Caili’s eyes froze as realization struck her.

She hugged Yun Che even tighter, until she was hanging on to him. “Aunt has always been an incredible person... I now have the Father who loves me the most, the aunt who spoils me the most, and the best Big Brother Yun in the world... Right now, I feel like the heavens have given me the best of everything.”

Yun Che did not say anything. His arms unconsciously tightened around her slender waist for an instant before they relaxed.

In the distance, Hua Fuchen could not approach the couple or leave the area. He could only shake his head helplessly. “This is the Pure Land, dammit! What a scandal! What a scandal!”

Hua Qingying dismissed the notion. “They were torn apart at the height of their passion, but now they can finally be together without fearing the light of day anymore. Why should they suppress their feelings?”

“Still, they should know their time and place. We’re in the—”

Hua Fuchen inhaled slightly before waving his sleeve. “Oh, forget it. They can do whatever they want. The boy is fine, so all is well.”

Hua Fuchen took his leave, but Hua Qingying remained. She kept watching the duo from afar until suddenly, she felt the corners of her lips twitching in a most unfamiliar manner. She subconsciously raised a long finger and touched her light pink lips.

Was that... a smile?

The first thing Yun Che did after returning to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God’s courtyard was to speak with Meng Jianxi.

“Divine Son Xi, I have a favor to ask of you.”

Meng Jianxi replied thoughtfully, “You are free to make any request, brother Yuan. There is no need to make it a favor at all.”

Yun Che said frankly, “I would like to enter the ‘Forbidden Zone of Slumbering Gods’.”

The one the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God chose to enter ‘Forbidden Zone of Slumbering Gods’ was, naturally, Meng Jianxi.

Meng Jianxi wasn’t the only one who was surprised by this. Hua Caili was even more stunned than he was.

Meng Jianxi mulled over the request for a moment. He did not ask why Yun Che wanted to enter the place. He said honestly, “There is nothing inherently wrong with this request. However, the abyssal dust of the Forbidden Zone of Slumbering Gods is comparable to the inner regions of the Endless Fog, and it harbors countless unpredictable threats and dangers. Given your current state...”

Yun Che said smilingly, “The punishment of devouring rage only causes the temporary collapse of body and soul. It is different from a serious injury. There are still a couple of hours before the entrance opens. It should be enough time for me to recover.”

“Then... I’m going to!” Hua Caili said urgently.

Yun Che knew it would turn out this way. He said in a helpless voice, “Your Father probably won’t agree to this.”

“He must!”

Hua Caili hurriedly let go of Yun Che and flew off. “I’ll go speak with him right now... Wait for me a little while, big brother Yun. I’ll be right back to keep you company.”

Meng Jianxi smiled at this. “I envy you. Assuming that the two of you marry soon and have a kid, they will become the ultimate treasure of Dreamweaver and Heaven Breaker for sure.”

Yun Che replied smilingly, “Even you don’t have a child yet, Divine Son Yuan. Surely there’s no need for me to hurry?”

Meng Jianxi shook his head. “I’ll be honest with you, Brother Yuan. I am indeed married, but... my talent cannot compare to yours. I still haven’t grasped the Dreamweaver Canon properly and so do not dare to lose my virginity.”

Yun Che: “Er, what...?”

Meng Jianxi waved his hand smilingly. “It’s just some trivialities. Pay it no attention. I will leave to inform Father and the Dream Lords about your decision right now. In the meantime, please do your best to recover your strength. I will return and inform you at a suitable time when the gate to the Forbidden Zone of Slumbering Gods opens.”

Despite what Hua Caili said, it took her a whole hour before she finally returned to Yun Che’s side. Clearly, it had taken a considerable amount of persuasion—in fact, Yun Che reckoned that she had enlisted Hua Qingying’s help as well—before she finally, just barely obtained Hua Fuchen’s permission.

After she returned, Hua Caili sat quietly beside Yun Che and just stared at him. Yun Che was currently surrounding himself in a sheen of white light and closing his eyes. For the next few hours, Hua Caili would not look away from him for even a moment. After today, they would truly belong to each other.

Once upon a time, they had walked the fine line between life and death together. Today, they had overcome the massive obstacle set in front of their path by the Abyssal Monarch Himself. Although the double amount of punishment of devouring rage had filled every inch of Yun Che’s body with terrible pain, it also engraved his image and her own promise at Eden’s Crown into every corner of her soul.

From now on, she honestly could not stomach any other person inside her soul. There was no one else in the entire world who could ever remove or replace him, either.

Hua Caili quietly extended her slender, jade-like fingers and gently traced the contours of Yun Che’s body. Her gaze was sometimes smiling, sometimes hazy, sometimes yearning... and it all converged in her eyes as undying devotion.

At the edge of the Pure Land, all of the Kingdoms of God except Boundless were gathered.

Dugu Zhuyuan’s hands moved, and the profound formation that had slumbered for god-knows-how-long shone with rich, dazzling spatial light. The light looked strangely grayish, though.

Shenwu Yi of the Eternal Night Kingdom of God stood at the forefront of the group, as she was the reason the Forbidden Zone of Slumbering Gods was opened once more. Following behind her was Xian Yue of the Star and Moon Kingdom of God, and Pan Buzhuo of the Owl Butterfly Kingdom of God.

When Hua Caili and Yun Che stepped forward together, everyone looked at the duo with surprise and astonishment. Although Hua Caili’s talent and cultivation in the way of the sword spoke for themselves, Hua Fuchen was not the type of person who would willingly subject her to such obvious danger.

Dugu Zhuyuan swept his gaze across the group and said indifferently, “Step inside this formation, and you will find yourself in the Forbidden Zone of Slumbering Gods. Any spoil you obtain in the forbidden zone belongs to you. You do not need to report it to the Pure Land.”

“However, I must remind you that the location you would be teleported to is random. In other words, you may be isolated from the beginning.”

Hua Fuchen’s eyebrows visibly clenched a bit more.

Dugu Zhuyuan slowly moved his gaze from one side to another. When no one backed down, he finally said, “However, as everyone entering the Forbidden Zone of Slumbering Gods is a Godbearer this time, the Abyssal Monarch had purposely prepared a failsafe method for everyone.”

He swiped his finger across the air, and five faint stars flew toward the group of five. They took the form of a jade orb that emitted a gray glow beside their bearers’ shoulders.

“This is a special kind of Void Breaking Divine Jade. One hundred and forty-four hours after you enter the Forbidden Zone of Slumbering Gods[1], it will automatically shatter and teleport you back to this entrance. If you encounter some sort of impossible danger during this period, you may crush this orb and return unharmed.”

As soon as Dugu Zhuyuan said this, the nervous expressions covering most elders’ faces vanished in an instant. 𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝑐𝘰𝑚

Hua Fuchen and Meng Kongchan looked much gladder as well. At the same time, they exchanged astonished glances with each other. From what they knew of the Abyssal Monarch... He wasn’t one to bestow such a boon.

Xian Yue immediately replied gratefully, “Please convey our thanks to the Abyssal Monarch, senior Dugu. We are infinitely grateful.”

Dugu Zhuyuan did not answer him. He turned sideways and said, “Consider this journey a trial. Do not push forward recklessly when faced with difficulty, and do not let greed consume you. No one can save you if you put yourself in a desperate situation where you are unable to shatter the Void Breaking Divine Jade.”

“Now then. You may enter.”

His voice was still lingering in the air when Shenwu Yi dashed forward and entered the formation. She did not hesitate for even an instant.

Pan Buzhuo cast a side glance at the Void-breaking Divine Jade on his shoulder and let out a light chuckle. Then, he arrogantly stepped into the formation.

“Divine Son Yuan, Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter, would you like to go first?”

Xian Yue turned toward the duo and greeted them with a friendly expression. Clearly, he meant to befriend Yun Che.

Yun Che gave him a suitable response. “Thank you. We shall gladly accept your offer. Perhaps we could fight side by side if we run into each other inside[2].”

Xian Yue smiled. “Xian Yue very much looks forward to it.”

Yun Che and Hua Caili stepped into the Void Breaching Great Formation together. As spatial divine light enveloped their bodies, Yun Che heard Hua Caili crying out, “You mustn’t put yourself at risk if you’re alone, okay, Big Brother Yun? Wait for me... I’ll find you as soon as I can.”

Gray light flashed, and both the light and her voice disappeared at the same time. Yun Che slowly closed his eyes. When he reopened them again, he was no longer looking at the clean space of the Pure Land.
