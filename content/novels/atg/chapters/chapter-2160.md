"However, this information about the Lord of the Abyss isn't entirely useless to me. In fact, his existence has resolved my greatest doubt."

"Your greatest... doubt?" In her memories, Li Suo had never heard Yun Che mention it.

"Li Suo," Yun Che said with great earnestness, "based on all the Creation God knowledge you've recovered so far, think hard about this question... do you, or any of the Creation Gods you know of, have a method to allow a True God's divine power to be inherited without any loss?"

Li Suo's contemplation did not last long before she gave the most direct response: "No."

"Right, no. By the simplest logic, if a True God's divine power could be passed down without loss to a non-divine body, then the True Gods of the primordial era would never have truly 'died.' The number of deities standing at the world's apex would have only grown, and the God Race would have expanded until it surpassed the mortal races, possibly even shaking the very order of the Heavenly Dao."

Hearing this, Li Suo finally understood what Yun Che meant by his "greatest doubt." Indeed, upon closer thought, it was a discrepancy so jarring it was terrifying.

"Even with your knowledge as a Creation God, your answer is 'no.' Then Mo Su... how could he have created six Artifacts of Inheritance capable of passing on the power of a True God?"

"Unless... the God Kingdoms' Artifacts of Inheritance were not created by him at all!"

Clang!

Deep in conversation with Li Suo, Yun Che walked headfirst into Dugu Zhuyuan's silver armor. Yun Che quickly looked up to see Dugu Zhuyuan had stopped and turned, bowing toward the distance.

Far in the sky, a streak of red flashed past. A fleeting, scorching aura seemed to brush over Yun Che, and then the red shadow vanished into the layered, thin clouds. In that instant, Yun Che felt both the Phoenix and Golden Crow bloodlines within him stir.

Was that... the Spirit Immortal Divine Officer?

Dugu Zhuyuan straightened up and turned his gaze. "Abyssal God Child, why were you so distracted?"

Unflustered, Yun Che asked, "Senior Dugu, where is this 'God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain' located, roughly?"

It wasn't a secret question, but Dugu Zhuyuan didn't give a precise answer. "It is in a remote location, connected by a Grand Void-Breaking Formation."

"Oh... In that case, if I were to enter, could the seniors from my Dream-Weaving God Kingdom follow me inside with their divine sense? That way, if I encounter danger, they could rescue me at any time and prevent any accidents."

"Impossible." Dugu Zhuyuan's reply was blunt. "The Abyssal Dust within the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain is extremely dense, making it difficult for divine sense to extend. Furthermore, it is sealed by a barrier personally erected by the Abyssal Emperor, which prevents any divine sense from the outside from penetrating. If the Abyssal God Child has reservations, you may simply choose not to enter."

Yun Che: In that case, I can rest easy.

"I see." Yun Che nodded, feigning seriousness. "Doesn't that make the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain an extremely dangerous place? Why is the Eternal Night Divine Maiden so insistent on entering... Could it be that great risks are accompanied by great opportunities?"

Dugu Zhuyuan remained noncommittal, stating coolly, "While there are dangers, those entering are primarily the God Children and Divine Maidens of the various kingdoms, so precautions are paramount. The Pure Land will naturally provide a method to preserve your life upon entry."

"Oh?"

"The Abyssal God Child will know when the time comes."

Just then, an ethereal voice tinged with urgency called from afar, "Brother Yun!! Brother Yun!!!"

The sound still lingered in the air as a beautiful figure arrived.

Hua Caili grabbed Yun Che's hand, her star-like eyes anxiously scanning him from head to toe. "Brother Yun, are you alright? Did Uncle Abyssal Emperor make things difficult for you?"

"Of course not," Yun Che said with a smile. "If the Abyssal Emperor truly wanted to make things difficult for me, a single word from afar would suffice. Why would he go to such trouble?"

Worried that Yun Che was just trying to comfort her, Hua Caili turned her gaze to Dugu Zhuyuan. "Uncle Dugu, the Abyssal Emperor really didn't make things difficult for Brother Yun, right? You are the Strongest Knight, noble and upright in character, a man who never lies."

Dugu Zhuyuan replied, "Rest assured, little Caili. I swear on the name of Dugu that the Abyssal Emperor did not make things difficult for the Abyssal God Child in the slightest."

As he finished, he cast a deeply complicated look at Yun Che. It was far more than just 'not making things difficult'...

"That's wonderful!" Hua Caili squeezed Yun Che's hands even tighter, seemingly completely relieved, a charming smile gracing her features. "Then I have good news for you too, Uncle Dugu. Aunt said she agrees to fight you."

Dugu Zhuyuan, a man as steady as a mountain, suddenly went rigid upon hearing this. A scorching excitement and battle intent uncontrollably surged from his body.

"Thank you, Caili," he said gratefully. "This favor..."

Hua Caili quickly interrupted him. "Don't worry about favors just yet. Aunt said she has one condition."

"Please, state it," Dugu Zhuyuan immediately replied.

"Aunt said that the loser of this battle must agree to one request from the victor, and so long as it does not violate the Heavenly Dao or human ethics, they cannot refuse. If you don't agree... she won't accept the fight."

"Fine!"

"Fine!" Without a moment's hesitation, Dugu Zhuyuan's already burning battle intent didn't cool in the slightest. "The loser must naturally accept the loser's fate. Please trouble Caili to inform the Sword Immortal that after I open the gates to the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain, I will await her esteemed presence at 'Heaven Above the Abyss'!"

His task of escorting Yun Che complete, Dugu Zhuyuan departed in a flash. Yet, his terrifying aura remained embedded in the space, lingering for a long time, prompting a sigh from Yun Che. How great would it be if he could become one of my Abyssal Ghosts.

"What are you thinking about?" Hua Caili floated up, her jade-like arms wrapping around Yun Che's neck, forcing their gazes to lock onto each other's.

Yun Che sighed. "I was thinking... Aunt is truly wonderful."

"Huh? Aunt?"

"That's right." Yun Che's arms tightened, pulling her soft, pliant body close. "Aunt chose to accept the challenge because she is trying to pave the way for our future in every way she can."

Hua Caili's beautiful eyes paused for a moment, and she instantly understood.

She pressed herself even closer until her entire body was hanging on him. "Aunt has always been this wonderful. I now have a Father God who dotes on me the most, an Aunt who spoils me the most, and the best Brother Yun in the world... Right now, I feel as if heaven has given me all the good things in existence."

"..." Yun Che said nothing, the arm around her slender waist unconsciously tightening, then slightly relaxing.

In the distance, Hua Fuchen was in a dilemma, unsure whether to approach or leave. He could only shake his head with a helpless expression. "This is the Pure Land! What a disgrace! What a disgrace¹"

Hua Qingying was unconcerned. "They were forced apart when their feelings were at their most intense. Now that they can finally be together without fear of the daylight, why should they have to suppress themselves?"

"They should still consider the occasion! This place is..." Hua Fuchen took a deep breath, then waved his hand dismissively. "Forget it, forget it. Let them be. As long as that boy is alright."

Hua Fuchen left, but Hua Qingying remained, watching the inseparable pair from afar. Unconsciously, she felt an unfamiliar twitch at the corners of her lips. She instinctively raised her long fingers to touch her pale cherry-colored lips.

Was that... a smile?

...

Returning to the courtyard residence of the Dream-Weaving God Kingdom, Yun Che immediately sought out Meng Jianxi.

"God Child Xi, I have a favor to ask."

Meng Jianxi's expression turned serious. "Younger Brother Yuan, if you need anything, just give the order. There is absolutely no need for the word 'ask'."

Yun Che got straight to the point. "I wish to enter the 'God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain' to have a look."

The person originally chosen by the Dream-Weaving God Kingdom was, naturally, Meng Jianxi.

"Ah?" Not only was Meng Jianxi taken aback, but Hua Caili was also startled.

"This..." Meng Jianxi pondered for a moment. Without asking for a reason, he said frankly, "There is no issue with the matter itself, but the Abyssal Dust in the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain is comparable to the depths of the Sea of Fog, and it holds countless unforeseeable risks. And in your current state..."

"Don't worry," Yun Che said with a smile. "The Punishment of Desolate Gnawing only caused a temporary collapse of my body and soul, not a grievous injury. There are still several hours left, which is enough time for me to recover."

"Then... I want to go too!" Hua Caili declared, her eyes filled with urgency.

Yun Che knew this would happen and said with some resignation, "Your Father God probably won't agree to you taking such a risk."

"He has to agree!" Hua Caili let go of Yun Che and flew off in a hurry. "I'll go find Father God right now... Brother Yun, wait for me for a little while. I'll be right back to keep you company."

Meng Jianxi smiled. "It's truly enviable. If the two of you were to marry and have a child soon, they would surely be the greatest treasure of our Dream-Weaving and Heaven-Folding Kingdoms."

Yun Che chuckled. "God Child Xi doesn't have any children yet, so why should I be in a hurry?"

Meng Jianxi shook his head. "I hope Younger Brother Yuan won't laugh, but although I am married... my innate talent cannot compare to yours. I have yet to master the Dream-Weaving Divine Canon, so I dare not rashly lose my virginity.²"

Yun Che: "Uh...?"

Meng Jianxi smiled and waved his hand. "It's a trivial matter, pay it no mind. I will go inform my father and the Dream Masters now. Younger Brother Yuan, please focus on your recovery here. I will come to inform you when the gates to the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain are about to open."

A full half-hour passed before Hua Caili floated back. It was clear she had gone through a lot of trouble, most likely pulling Hua Qingying in as reinforcement again, to finally secure Hua Fuchen's reluctant permission.

Afterward, she quietly stayed by Yun Che's side, watching him with a dazed, infatuated gaze as he recovered within a white glow. For several hours, she couldn't bear to look away. In her world, after today, they would truly and completely belong to each other.

They had walked the edge of death together and overcome the immense obstacle of the Abyssal Emperor. The doubled Punishment of Desolate Gnawing had filled Yun Che's body with agony, but it had also etched his figure, along with the promise she had shouted atop Eden's Cloud Crest, deeply into every corner of her soul... There was no longer room for anyone else, and no one could ever erase or replace him.

She quietly extended a slender, jade-like finger, gently tracing the outline of Yun Che's body. Her gaze at times held a smile, at times was hazy with emotion, at times filled with deep affection... all of it converging in her eyes, reflecting only a love that was unwavering until death.³

...

At the edge of the Pure Land, the various kingdoms gathered... all except for the Samsara God Kingdom.

As Dugu Zhuyuan's hand gestures changed, the long-dormant profound formation before them suddenly flared with a dense, spatial divine light... but it was a strangely gray color.

Shen Wuyi of the Eternal Night God Kingdom stood at the front. The God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain was being opened because of her, so she had the right to be the first to enter. The Star Moon God Kingdom was represented by Xian Yue, and the Owl Butterfly God Kingdom by Pan Buzhuo... When Hua Caili and Yun Che stepped forward together, they undoubtedly drew a host of astonished looks. Hua Caili's mastery of the sword was plain for all to see... but Hua Fuchen had never been willing to let her face danger.

Dugu Zhuyuan's eyes swept over the group as he spoke coolly, "Step into this formation, and you will enter the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain. Anything you gain within belongs to you; there is no need to report it to the Pure Land. However, I must remind you all that through this Grand Void-Breaking Formation, your teleportation points within the domain will not be fixed."

"In other words, from the very beginning, you will most likely be isolated and without aid."

Hua Fuchen's brow visibly furrowed.

Dugu Zhuyuan's gaze shifted. Seeing that no one was retreating in fear, he continued, "However, considering that those entering this time are all the divine inheritors of their respective kingdoms, the Abyssal Emperor has specially granted a considerate gift."

With a flick of his finger, five faint stars of light flew toward the five individuals, coalescing beside their shoulders into jade orbs that pulsed with a faint gray light.

"This is a special Void-Breaking Divine Jade. Seventy-two hours after you enter the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain, it will forcibly shatter and return you to this place. If, during these seventy-two hours, you encounter an irresistible danger, you can actively destroy this orb to retreat unharmed."

At these words, the elders of the God Kingdoms all felt a great sense of relief, their tension vanishing completely. Hua Fuchen and Meng Kongchan's expressions brightened, and they exchanged a look of surprise. Given the Abyssal Emperor's temperament... he would never have intentionally bestowed such a grace.

Xian Yue immediately expressed his gratitude. "In that case, please convey our deepest thanks to the Abyssal Emperor for his gift, Senior Dugu. We are endlessly grateful."

Dugu Zhuyuan remained noncommittal and turned to the side. "Consider this journey a trial. Do not press on recklessly when faced with difficulties, nor let greed consume you. Otherwise, if you fall into a desperate situation and cannot destroy the Void-Breaking Divine Jade in time, no one will be able to save you."

"Everyone, please proceed."

Before his voice had faded, Shen Wuyi's figure flickered and shot straight into the formation without a moment's hesitation.

Pan Buzhuo glanced at the Void-Breaking Divine Jade on his shoulder, gave a faint smile, and stepped into the formation with a proud posture.

"Abyssal God Child, Heaven-Folding Divine Maiden, please." Xian Yue turned to the side, his expression quite friendly. It was clear he intended to befriend Yun Che.

Yun Che responded in kind, "Alright, then we won't be polite. If we are fortunate enough to meet in the forbidden domain, Moon God Child, perhaps we can fight side by side."

Xian Yue smiled. "I would look forward to it immensely."

Yun Che and Hua Caili stepped into the Grand Void-Breaking Formation together. The moment their figures were engulfed by the spatial divine light, Hua Caili's call echoed in his ears: "Brother Yun, you must not face danger alone! Wait for me... I will find you as soon as I can!"

The gray light flared, and both light and sound vanished. Yun Che slowly closed his eyes. When he opened them again, he would no longer be in the Pure Land.
