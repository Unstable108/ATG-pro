“However, the information about this Abyssal Master¹ is not entirely useless to me. His existence, in fact, has resolved my greatest long-standing doubt.”

“Greatest... doubt?” In her memory, Li Sa² had never heard Yun Che³ mention it.

“Li Sa,” Yun Che said very seriously, “With all the Creation God⁴ knowledge you’ve recovered so far, try your best to ponder a question... Do you, or any Creation God you know, possess a method to allow a True God’s⁵ divine power to be inherited without any loss by a non-divine body?”

Li Sa’s contemplation didn’t last long before she gave the most direct answer: “No.”

“Exactly, no. From the simplest and clearest common sense, if a True God’s divine power could be inherited by a non-divine body without loss, then the True Gods of the Ancient Era would never truly ‘die.’ The deities who stood at the pinnacle of the world would only grow in number, the Divine Race would expand, eventually surpassing the Mortal Race, and it might even shake the order of the Heavenly Way.”

Hearing this, Li Sa finally understood what Yun Che’s “greatest doubt” was. Indeed, it was a contradiction so alarming that it became terrifying upon closer thought.

“Even with your Creation God knowledge, you answered ‘no.’ Then Mo Su⁶... how was he able to create six Inheritance Artifacts that could transmit the power of True Gods?”

“Unless... the Inheritance Artifacts of the Divine Realm were not created by him at all!”

Clang!

Yun Che, who was concentrating on communicating with Li Sa, bumped his head against Dugu Zhuyuan’s⁷ silver armor.

Yun Che quickly looked up, only to see Dugu Zhuyuan stop and turn, then bow towards the distance.

In the distant sky, a red silhouette swiftly streaked past, and a fleeting, scorching aura seemed to brush lightly over Yun Che’s body. Then, the red silhouette vanished into the layered thin clouds.

In that instant, Yun Che felt both his Phoenix bloodline and Golden Crow bloodline stir simultaneously.

Was that... a Spirit Immortal Divine Official?

Dugu Zhuyuan straightened up and turned his gaze: “Abyssal Divine Son⁸, why are you distracted?”

Yun Che unhurriedly replied, “Senior Dugu, where exactly is that ‘God-Slumber Forbidden Zone’⁹?”

It wasn’t a particularly secret question, but Dugu Zhuyuan didn’t give a precise answer: “A remote place, connected by a Void-Breaking Grand Array¹⁰.”

“Oh... then if I enter, can my Weaving Dream seniors follow with their divine sense? That way, if I encounter danger inside, they can rescue me at any time and prevent accidents.”

“No,” Dugu Zhuyuan answered directly. “The Abyssal Dust¹¹ in the God-Slumber Forbidden Zone is extremely dense, making it difficult for divine sense to extend. Furthermore, there’s a barrier personally erected by the Abyssal Emperor¹², which inherently prevents divine sense from outside the barrier from probing in. If the Abyssal Divine Son has any concerns, you don’t have to enter.”

Yun Che: “Then I can rest assured.”

“I see,” Yun Che nodded gravely. “Then isn’t this God-Slumber Forbidden Zone an extremely dangerous place? Why would the Evernight Divine Daughter¹³ insist on entering... Could it be that great risks are accompanied by great opportunities?”

Dugu Zhuyuan neither confirmed nor denied, merely saying, “While there is danger, those who enter are generally Divine Sons and Daughters from various realms, so safety is paramount. Upon entry, the Pure Land¹⁴ will naturally provide life-saving measures.”

As he finished speaking, he cast a very complex glance at Yun Che.

That was more than just not making things difficult...

“That’s good!” Hua Caili¹⁵ gripped Yun Che’s hands even tighter, seemingly completely relieved, a sweet smile gracing her brows. “Then I’ll also give Uncle Dugu some good news. Aunt said she agreed to fight you.”

Dugu Zhuyuan, whose temperament was as steady as a mountain, suddenly heard these words. His body instantly tensed, and then a fervent excitement and battle intent uncontrollably surged from him.

He said gratefully, “Thank you, Caili. This favor...”

Hua Caili quickly interrupted him: “No need for talk of favors for now. Aunt said she has a condition.”

Dugu Zhuyuan immediately said, “Just speak, there’s no harm.”

“Aunt said that the loser of this battle must agree to one request from the winner, and it must be within the bounds of the Heavenly Way and human ethics, with no refusal allowed. If you don’t agree... she won’t accept the challenge.”

“Good!” Dugu Zhuyuan didn’t hesitate for even a moment, and his already burning battle intent didn’t cool down in the slightest. “The loser shall naturally bear the loser’s fate. Please trouble Caili to inform the Sword Immortal¹⁶ that after I open the gate to the God-Slumber Forbidden Zone, I will await her esteemed presence at ‘Yuan Shang Tian’¹⁷ at any time!”

With the task of escorting Yun Che complete, Dugu Zhuyuan vanished in an instant. However, his formidable aura remained embedded in this space, lingering for a long time, making Yun Che sigh involuntarily: How wonderful it would be if he could become my Abyssal Ghost¹⁸.

“What are you thinking about?” Hua Caili floated up, her jade arms wrapping around Yun Che’s neck, making their gazes meet directly.

Yun Che sighed, “I was thinking... Aunt is truly wonderful.”

“Huh? Aunt?”

“That’s right,” Yun Che gathered her closer with an arm, pressing her soft, boneless jade body tightly against his. “Aunt chose to accept the challenge because she’s trying to pave the way for our future in various ways.”

Hua Caili’s beautiful eyes paused, and she immediately understood. She pressed her body even closer, completely clinging to Yun Che. “Aunt has always been this good. Now I have my father god who dotes on me the most, my aunt who spoils me the most, and the best Yun Gege¹⁹ in the world... Now, I just feel like heaven has given me all the good things.”

Yun Che didn’t speak, the arm around her slender waist unconsciously tightened, then slightly loosened.

In the distance, Hua Fuchen²⁰ didn’t know whether to approach or leave, and could only shake his head with a helpless expression: “This is the Pure Land, what kind of decorum is this, what kind of decorum!”

Hua Qingying²¹ was unconcerned: “They were forced apart when their feelings were strongest. Now that they can finally be unafraid of the light of day, why should they suppress themselves?”

“Even so, they should consider the occasion, this place is...” Hua Fuchen secretly took a breath, then waved his hand dismissively: “Never mind, never mind, let them be. As long as that boy is fine.”

Hua Fuchen left, but Hua Qingying remained in place, watching the inseparable pair from afar. Unconsciously, she felt a strange twitch at the corners of her lips.

She instinctively raised a long finger and touched her light cherry-colored lips.

Was that a smile just now?

Returning to the courtyard where the Weaving Dream Divine Realm was located, Yun Che immediately sought out Meng Jianxi²².

“Divine Son Xi, I have a request.”

Meng Jianxi said earnestly, “Brother Yuan, you can simply command whatever you need; there’s absolutely no need for the word ‘request’.”

Yun Che immediately stated directly, “I wish to enter the ‘God-Slumber Forbidden Zone’ for a look.”

The original chosen person for the Weaving Dream Divine Realm was, naturally, Meng Jianxi.

“Ah?” As soon as these words were spoken, not only Meng Jianxi but Hua Caili was also startled.

“This...” Meng Jianxi pondered briefly, not asking for the reason, but candidly said, “The matter itself is not impossible, but the Abyssal Dust in the God-Slumber Forbidden Zone is comparable to the deep fog sea, and there are countless unpredictable risks. And your current state...”

“Don’t worry,” Yun Che smiled. “The Desolate Devour Punishment²³ only caused a temporary collapse of my body and soul, not a severe injury. I still have several hours, which is enough for me to recover.”

“Then... I want to go too!” Hua Caili said with eager eyes.

Yun Che knew this would happen and said with some helplessness, “Your father god probably won’t agree to you taking such a risk.”

“He must agree!”

Hua Caili let go of Yun Che and hurriedly flew away: “I’m going to find Father God right now... Yun Gege, wait for me for a little while, I’ll be right back to accompany you.”

Meng Jianxi smiled: “How enviable. If the two of you were to marry and have children soon, you would surely be the greatest treasures of both our Weaving Dream and Heaven-Folding Divine Realms.”

Yun Che said with a smile, “Divine Son Xi has no children yet, so why should I be in a hurry?”

Meng Jianxi shook his head: “Don’t laugh at me, Brother Yuan, though I am already married, my talent cannot compare to yours. I haven’t yet mastered the Weaving Dream Divine Canon, so I truly dare not easily lose my virgin body.”

Yun Che: “Uh...?”

Meng Jianxi waved his hand with a smile: “It’s a small matter, no need to mind it. I’ll go inform Father God and the Dream Masters now. Brother Yuan, please recover as much as you can here. When the gate to the God-Slumber Forbidden Zone opens, I will come and inform you in due course.”

It took a full half-hour for Hua Caili to float back. Clearly, she had gone through a lot of trouble, most likely enlisting Hua Qingying as a helper, before finally managing to get Hua Fuchen’s reluctant permission.

Then, she quietly stayed by Yun Che’s side, gazing at him blankly and infatuatedly as he closed his eyes to recover amidst a white glow. For several hours, she couldn’t bear to look away.

In her world, after today, they would truly and completely belong to each other.

They had walked the edge of death together, broken through the immense obstruction from the Abyssal Emperor, and the double Desolate Devour Punishment, which filled Yun Che’s entire body with pain, also etched Yun Che’s image and the promise she shouted on the Cloud Summit of Eden deeply into every corner of Hua Caili’s soul... leaving no room for anyone else, and no one could ever erase or replace him.

She quietly extended her slender jade fingers, gently tracing Yun Che’s body, her gaze sometimes smiling, sometimes hazy, sometimes filled with longing... All converging in her eyes, reflecting only an unwavering devotion until death.

At the edge of the Pure Land, all the realms gathered... except for the Senluo Divine Realm.

As Dugu Zhuyuan changed his hand gestures, the profound array that had been silent for a long time suddenly glowed with a rich spatial divine light... but it was a slightly strange gray color.

Shen Wuyi²⁴ of the Evernight Divine Realm was at the forefront. The God-Slumber Forbidden Zone was opened because of her, so she was naturally qualified to be the first to step in.

Xian Yue²⁵ represented the Star-Moon Divine Realm, and Pan Buzhuo²⁶ represented the Owl-Butterfly Divine Realm...

When Hua Caili and Yun Che stepped forward side-by-side, it undoubtedly drew a multitude of astonished gazes.

Hua Caili’s sword dao cultivation was evident to all... but Hua Fuchen had never been willing to let her take risks.

Dugu Zhuyuan’s gaze swept over everyone, and he spoke calmly: “Stepping into this array will allow you to enter the God-Slumber Forbidden Zone. If you gain anything within, it will all be yours; there’s no need to report it to the Pure Land. However, I must remind everyone that through this Void-Breaking Grand Array, your teleportation location within the God-Slumber Forbidden Zone is not fixed.”

“In other words, from the very beginning, you are highly likely to be isolated and without aid.”

Hua Fuchen’s eyebrows visibly sank a fraction.

Dugu Zhuyuan shifted his gaze, and after confirming that no one showed fear or retreated, he said, “However, considering that the entrants this time are all Divine Inheritors from various realms, the Abyssal Emperor has specially bestowed a comprehensive gift.”

As he finished speaking, he waved a finger, and five faint starlights flew towards the five individuals, then condensed into a jade bead on their shoulders, circulating with a faint gray glow.

“This is a special Void-Breaking Divine Jade²⁷. At the seventy-second hour after you enter the God-Slumber Forbidden Zone, it will forcibly shatter and return you to this place. And if, within these seventy-two hours, you encounter an irresistible danger, you can actively destroy this bead and retreat safely.”

As these words were spoken, the elders of the various Divine Realms all felt their heartstrings greatly relieved, and their tension vanished. Hua Fuchen and Meng Kongchan’s expressions brightened even further, and they exchanged surprised glances.

A boon.

Given the Abyssal Emperor’s temperament... he would never specifically grant such a thing.

Xian Yue immediately said gratefully, “In that case, please Senior Dugu, convey our thanks to the Abyssal Emperor for his grace. We are immensely grateful.”

Dugu Zhuyuan neither confirmed nor denied, turning sideways: “Consider this journey a trial. Do not push forward recklessly when faced with difficulty, nor be overly greedy. Otherwise, if you fall into a desperate situation and fail to destroy the Void-Breaking Divine Jade in time, no one will be able to save you.”

“Everyone, please proceed.”

Before his voice faded, Shen Wuyi’s figure had already darted directly into the array, without a moment’s hesitation.

Pan Buzhuo glanced at the Void-Breaking Divine Jade on his shoulder, gave a faint smile, and stepped into the array with a proud demeanor.

“Abyssal Divine Son, Heaven-Folding Divine Daughter, please,” Xian Yue said, turning sideways with a very friendly expression. Clearly, he intended to befriend Yun Che.

Yun Che also responded, “Alright, then we won’t be polite. If we are fortunate enough to meet Divine Son Yue in the Forbidden Zone, perhaps we can fight side-by-side.”

Xian Yue smiled, “Xian Yue greatly anticipates it.”

Yun Che and Hua Caili stepped into the Void-Breaking Grand Array side-by-side. The moment their figures were engulfed by the spatial divine light, Hua Caili’s shout reached his ears:

“Yun Gege, you absolutely must not take risks alone, wait for me... I will definitely find you as soon as possible.”

Gray light flashed, and light and sound vanished simultaneously. Yun Che slowly closed his eyes. When he opened them again, the space before him would no longer be that of the Pure Land.
