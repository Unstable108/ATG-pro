The Chief Priest eventually shifted his gaze away and looked at the Abyssal Monarch. He asked him via sound transmission, “Monarch, it is colorless and flawless, pure and clean to the extreme. It can only be the Glazed Glass Ice.”

“However, the Glazed Glass Ice disappeared a long time ago. It can never reappear. Could I be wrong?” The Chief Priest was questioning himself, a man whose knowledge and experience were unfathomable.

The Abyssal Monarch replied, “This woman possesses the Nine Profound Exquisite Body and the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass. Her Nine Profound has matured, and her Glazed Glass has bloomed. That is how her Exquisite Profound Worlds and Glazed Glass Ice came to be.”

The Chief Priest fell silent for a long time before asking, “But... how?”

“I do not know. There is no need to know.” The oddities regarding Shenwu Yi were world-shattering to put it mildly, and yet the Abyssal Monarch’s reply was overflowing with inexplicable indifference. Still, the Chief Priest did not ask further.

A causeless person... The thought surfaced in the Abyssal Monarch’s mind before he carelessly wiped it away and returned to indifference.

More and more people noticed the strange, icy light shining around Shenwu Yi. As the light kept refracting, they eventually realized that it was a protective barrier of some sort. It gave off a faint trace of ice, but the icy light it exuded looked like nothing they had ever seen. Instead, it was transparent to the point of being colorless and invisible.

Meng Jianxi looked completely confused. “None of the profound arts practiced by the Eternal Night Kingdom of God involves ice, and... the profound light emitted by an icy aura is varying degrees of blue, right? Why is this ice completely transparent?”

Meng Kongchan did not answer because he had never seen such an icy aura himself. He especially did not understand how such a weak ice barrier was able to block Dian Jiuzhi’s power of Great Rage.

Yun Che looked up into the sky with a deep frown on his face. Ice... is it the Ice Phoenix God Investiture Canon she used to practice?

No, that’s completely wrong. Besides, why is it colorless?

Natural ice was colorless, but the ice energy created from profound energy emitted a blue light. This was common knowledge.

As the greatest master of ice profound energy of the universe, Yun Che knew this better than anyone. The ice blue color that everyone knew about in the profound way was the natural effect of ice profound energy. That was why there had never been any record of a colorless profound ice.

“Pale Flame... Glazed Glass Ice...”

Suddenly, a whisper appeared in Yun Che’s soul sea.

Yun Che withdrew his thoughts and asked, “What did you say?”

Li Suo took her time to tidy the memory fragments that were triggered before answering very, very slowly, “When the Ancestral God created the universe, she left behind Three Tribulations and Three Boons.”

“One of the Three Tribulations is the fiercest fire, the Pale Flame, and one of the Three Boons is the cleanest water, the Glazed Glass Ice.”

Three Tribulations and Three Boons? It was something Yun Che had never heard, and a concept that no longer existed in any known record. It was because their existences dated back to a time when the god race and the devil race weren’t fully formed yet.

“The Pale Flame, the fiercest fire in the universe, could burn through space and scorch a god’s body until it broke. Pale white in color, anyone who touches it would turn to ash. Ni Xuan ultimately extinguished this tribulation, and an indestructible origin seed was left behind.”

“At first, Ni Xuan tried to master the power. However, his efforts ended in failure. So, he had no choice but to break it down into three fragments using the most extreme power of the Creation God of Elements. He later gifted these three fragments to the three Beast races, and they are the Vermillion Bird, the Phoenix, and the Golden Crow.”

The revelation struck a chord with Yun Che. The Vermillion Bird, the Phoenix, and the Golden Crow. They were the names of the famous Three Supreme Fire Attribute Beasts of the Era of Gods. No wonder the three Beast races respected Ni Xuan so much.

“During the karmic balancing at the very beginning of the universe, the cleanest Boon that stands opposed to the fiercest Tribulation is the Glazed Glass Ice.”

“The Glazed Glass Ice is absolutely clean, pure, colorless, and flawless. It is the Ancestral God’s gift to the universe when she first created it. It could illuminate and purify all filthy and tainted objects in the universe.”

“The source of the Glazed Glass Ice is the Glazed Glass Divine Aura that roams the universe. It can bless a newborn girl with the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass. When the heart has reached full maturity, it will form the Glazed Glass Ice.”

A woman of Glazed Glass could perceive good or evil with their heart, and discern truth and falsehoods with their eyes. Their body, soul, and aura are all flawless and pure. If she is near the heavenly law, it would grant her its protection. If she is near profound energy, it could not bear to harm her. If she is near sin, sin would naturally feel guilty and ashamed...”

“However...”

Li Suo’s tone changed into one of regret. “This particular Boon had permanently disappeared before the fiercest Tribulation.”

“Why’s that?”

Li Suo explained, “The gods created life, and life filled countless worlds. However, this also gave rise to endless malice, greed, desire, and slaughter. It all turned into countless layers of dirty dust that enveloped heaven and earth.”

“The filth and dust that even the Ancestral God failed to predict contaminated the universe’s aura layer by layer. Over time, more and more of the Glazed Glass Divine Aura was eroded and destroyed until only wisps of it remained. Today, they could only be found deep within the primordial energy where all things began.”

“The universe could not return to what it was before once the contamination passed a certain threshold. Although women with the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass still appeared every once in a while thanks to the divine aura’s blessing, they could no longer form the Glazed Glass Ice and become true women of Glazed Glass. As they grew up in a contaminated universe, they would lose even their Heart of Snow Glazed Glass and revert to mundane women.”

Yun Che patiently and quietly listened to Li Suo’s explanation until the end. It was only now he asked, “So... you’re saying that the colorless ice she’s using is the Glazed Glass Ice?”

Li Suo answered, “Its color, shape, and aura all match what I know... but there is a huge discrepancy.”

“The ice may be Glazed Glass Ice, but her aura does not belong to that of a woman of Glazed Glass at all.”

Naturally, Yun Che could not fully understand her words.

He asked urgently, “She does possess the one and only Heart of Snow Glazed Glass in the entire world, but didn’t you say that the Glazed Glass Ice cannot reappear anymore??”

“Besides, the world back then cannot possibly be more filthy and tainted than the Abyss.”

Li Suo fell silent for a moment. She was searching for the blurry memory fragments she had recently awakened. To Yun Che’s surprise, she was able to give him a somewhat clear answer, “There is one possibility.”

“She has the Ancestral God’s sacred aura on her... and she is a causeless person.”

Yun Che: “What do you mean by... causeless?”

Li Suo replied, “She did not come to be naturally. Excluding the four Creation Gods and four Devil Emperors, she is the ninth living being to be created by the Ancestral God herself. The Creation Gods and the Devil Emperors were all created for a reason, and she is no exception.”

Yun Che’s heartstrings shook uncontrollably for a few breaths.

“The God Realm and the Abyss were two isolated universes. When she fell into the Abyss, the karmic bond between you two was completely severed. Combined with the fact that she lost her memories, her existence... no longer as a cause.”

“As a result, she became a pure ‘causeless person’ who should not exist in the universe’s concept or laws.”

“Perhaps this purity that transcends even concepts and laws is why her Heart of Snow Glazed Glass is able to bloom and form the Glazed Glass Ice.”

This was her guess. This was also the only possibility she could think of after searching through everything she knew as a Creation God.

Cries of surprise and puzzlement rang out here and there, but no one could say the name “Glazed Glass Ice”. It was because this concept did not exist among the Six Kingdoms of Gods.

Looking up at the black, fairy-like figure, Dian Jiuzhi once again felt an inexplicable sense of shame and self-abasement. The emotions were rapidly flooding over his mind like tidal water, so he had no choice but to look away, push away the stray thoughts, and resummon the silver radiance that had just waned.

This time, he created a giant silver bow and drew it. It looked like a full moon at full draw. When he released the bowstring, silver arrows filled the sky and enveloped the entire battlefield like a hanging river, covering every inch of blind spot.

Shenwu Yi did not move from her position. She simply swung the Heartless Sword like a cloud brushing against the sleeve.

This time, everyone saw as clear as day that a layer of colorless ice had encompassed her blade. Its crystalline light was pure, cold, and sharp.

Just when everyone thought that Shenwu Yi would evade at full force using her Exquisite Profound Worlds, she swung her ice-encased sword at the sea of silver light arrows shooting toward her.

Ding!! The icy crystal made contact with the first light arrow, but instead of the devastating explosion of the Divine Vein of Great Rage, it clinked like jadeites smacking into one another. When the icy light flashed, the exceedingly volatile arrow aimed at her heart actually shifted off course and flew past her torso. It wasn’t until it struck the barrier at the edge of the battlefield that it finally unleashed its destructive light and power.

Dian Rahu’s eyes were as wide as bells at this point. He cared little about controlling his expression in the first place, and right now every inch of his face was arranged into a look of utter shock.

He was the bearer of the greatest Boundless Divine Power in the world, and he had practiced the Boundless Manifestation Art for over twenty thousand years. However, he never knew that the power could be so... tame?!

The second arrow followed right after the first and clashed against the ice-encased blade once more. Just like before, the contact only elicited a soft clink, and the light arrow was parried just like that.

The third, fourth... tenth... hundredth... thousandth arrow came, and still Shenwu Yi parried them all.

Clink clink clink clink clink clink...

Her form was divine, and her sword dance was exquisite. The mixture of silver and icy lights looked like a phantasmal cloud that naturally surrounded her person. It was such that the stunned gazes of the crowd gradually transformed into dreamlike infatuation.

BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM—

In the end, the last light arrow too struck the barrier and unleashed a devastating silver explosion that scorched the sky. It clearly illuminated Shenwu Yi’s spotless clothes and unblemished face.

Throughout the attack, Dian Jiuzhi’s arms remained exactly where they were. He did not move even after the silver light had faded entirely.

Everything that had happened today was too illusory and ludicrous. Again and again, shock had overwhelmed him, and his common sense was crushed to smithereens. At this point, his shock and confusion could no longer be quelled by mere reason.

“What... demonic art... is this?” A Boundless elder murmured unconsciously.

This was a man of unimaginable power and influence, and yet he had said something utterly ridiculous. That was just how shocked he was.

Shenwu Yi did not give Dian Jiuzhi any time to recover his senses. After she was done parrying the attack, she drew what looked like a profound seal with her sword. It was only about one-third of a meter long, but it gave off an intimidating aura as it rapidly took form.

“The Purify God Seal!” Meng Jianxi let out a low cry.

Yun Che was well aware of the Purify God Seal. It was the Eternal Night Kingdom of God’s strongest and most critical profound art. The profound practitioner would be able to create seven great profound seals in total as they progressed through the profound art. They were Break the Delusion, Overcome the Misfortune, Remove the Dust, Cleanse the Heart, Still the Soul, Trace the Light, and finally, the seal that only a Divine Regent could manifest, the Shenwu World Purifying Seal!

“Shenwu Qing never earned the qualification to cultivate the Purify God Seal until she died, and Shenwu Yi did it in just twenty years? Sss!”

Meng Jianxi sucked in a cold breath before continuing, “Then again, compared to the Exquisite Profound World and the strange ice, this much is nothing. I wonder which level she’s at though?”

“Wait a second!! Why is her Purify God Seal... colorless!?”

The profound seal Shenwu Yi was carving was crimson at first, but the color gradually faded away as the icy light flickered. When the seal was fully formed, it looked pure, limpid, and perfectly transparent.

The Heartless Sword swung, and the transparent profound seal descended toward Dian Jiuzhi. Most people recognized it as the first seal, Break The Delusion. However, it was also massively different from the one they knew. It was because the colorless, icy light had completely overwritten Shenwu's powerful energy.

The icy profound crystal emitted the presence of a sixth-level Divine Extinction Realm. Normally, it was of no threat to Dian Jiuzhi. However, after all the “lessons” he had received, Dian Jiuzhi decided to take the attack seriously. He split his power of Great Rage into two. One-fifth of his power was used for defense, while four-fifths was used for offense.

The moment he lifted his arm, his silver light transformed into a massive, three-hundred-meter-long whip. The moment he swung it, it would whip up a titanic storm that engulfed dozens of kilometers at once. In other words, the storm of destruction would envelop the entire battlefield. He really wanted to know how Shenwu Yi would dodge this one.

The icy profound seal moved really, really fast. Dian Jiuzhi’s forcefield slowed it down a little, but that was all it did before it struck him directly.

Dian Jiuzhi trusted his defenses to hold as he prepared to unleash his own attack. However, his protective profound energy had just burst into life when it suddenly dimmed without warning.

The icy seal exploded, and Dian Jiuzhi’s movement stiffened. His complexion had changed dramatically as well.

He felt a piercing cold exploding across his right chest before invading his body. He felt as if billions of icy needles had stabbed into his flesh, blood, and veins. It instantly numbed his right arm and froze nearly half of his surging profound energy.

Dian Jiuzhi did not swing the long whip he conjured. Instead, he slowly looked down at his right chest with a stupefied expression.

His protective, profound energy was still shimmering on his torso. It hadn’t crumbled at all.

During that brief instant of shock, cold air hit him from above. Then, the second seal—Overcome the Misfortune—crashed against his head with twice as much power and light as before.

“If she is near the heavenly law, it would grant her its protection. If she is near profound energy, it could not bear to harm her. If she is near sin, sin would naturally feel guilty and ashamed...”

Li Suo’s words reverberated inside Yun Che’s soul sea. He was watching it right now. Be it destructive or defensive, profound energy, the Glazed Glass Ice had “tamed” them all.
