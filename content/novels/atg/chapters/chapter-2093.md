Meng Cangji roared, but no one responded to him for a time.

Even those on his side—Meng Kongdu and Meng Jinghai for example—were wearing awkward expressions on their faces.

“Hahahaha!” Meng Chaoyang burst out laughing. “I did not know that Jianze had the habit of treating his guests with Profound Imagery Stones. What an eye opening experience this has been!”

The news that Meng Jianyuan had stolen a Divine Jade of Revelation had spread like wildfire, alarming all nine Dream Lords. Shocked and suspicious they might be, their first instinct—despite what they personally chose to believe—was that Meng Jianyuan really had done such a thing. After all, the rumormonger would not have dared to fan the news so if they didn’t have solid proof.

Still, they never imagined that the actual process of the theft was like this.

Everyone here was a Lord of Dream Halls; an old fox. It was clear as day that this was a trap to bait out Meng Jianyuan’s greed and recklessness.

Combined with the fact that Meng Jianyuan had just returned to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God and almost certainly could not have any run-in with any higher class abyssal crystals before this, much less recognize the Divine Jade of Revelation or know that it was a gift to Meng Jianxi by the Divine Regent... the possibility that Meng Jianyuan might have succumbed to his baser impulses and committed theft definitely wasn’t zero.

“Hmph!” Meng Cangji harrumphed. “It doesn’t matter if Jianze has a habit or not! The important thing is that Meng Jianyuan has definitely stolen the Divine Jade of Revelation! Not only did he commit such an ugly crime...”

He turned to look at Meng Kongchan. “He openly lied about his innocence in front of the Divine Regent! After all the trust and love you have given him! How could he?!”

“I wouldn’t say that Meng Jianyuan ‘definitely’ stole the Divine Jade of Revelation,” Meng Chaofeng interrupted. “Divine Son Yuan’s back was blocking the view, so we could not actually be sure if he had put away the Divine Jade of Revelation. Besides, its divine light disappeared at the same time the box was closed. If you ask me, it looks like Divine Son Yuan placed the Divine Jade of Revelation back in its box.”

Meng Cangji glanced at Meng Jianze and found that his composure hadn’t wavered one bit. His last bit of worry disappearing into nothing, he ordered, “Jianze, explain.”

Meng Jianze looked up and declared with a staunch expression, “I am Father’s son and the student of all Dream Lords here. I would not dare to lie about this even if I was a million times more arrogant than I am. The Divine Jade of Revelation has absolutely disappeared from its box, and the only one who made contact with it was Meng Jianyuan!”

Meng Chaoyang and Meng Chaofeng fell silent. They must admit that Meng Jianze wouldn’t dare to make such a terrible accusation unless he was absolutely certain. They snuck a glance at Yun Che, but the young man was still bleary-eyed and perfectly composed. Despite everything he was facing, they could only spot the annoyance of someone who had been woken up prematurely from their slumber.

They snuck a look at Meng Kongchan next. His face was as cold, dignified, and inscrutable as usual.

Meng Jianze looked at Yun Che and declared, “The Divine Jade of Revelation could not have disappeared into thin air. It must be with Meng Jianyuan. He wouldn’t have left it in his palace to avoid its divine aura being detected, so... we simply need to check his portable space to retrieve the stolen goods!”

“Unacceptable!” Meng Chaoyang barked harshly. “Investigating one’s portable space is a grave breach of anyone’s privacy, much less Divine Son Yuan’s!”

Meng Cangji retorted, “The Divine Jade of Revelation and the character of the sub Divine Son are at stake here. Privacy can wait for another day!”

“Jianze!” Meng Cangji said in a low tone, “This Dream Lord shall believe what you’re saying for now and allow the forceful search of Meng Jianyuan’s portable space. However... if the Divine Jade of Revelation is not with Meng Jianyuan, you understand what will happen, don’t you?”

Meng Jianze did not look afraid. There was only determination. “If I have spoken a single lie, may I die a million deaths as recompense!”

“...” Meng Jianxi was frowning deeply. There were several times he tried to speak but could not.

“Very good.” Meng Cangji nodded and shot Meng Jianxi an assuring look. It was only then he glanced at Meng Kongchan and said, “Supreme one, what should we do? We will obey your command no matter what.”

It sounded like he was asking for permission, but he was really pressuring Meng Kongchan.

If Meng Kongchan decreed that the matter was to be suppressed and forgotten, no one would dare say otherwise. However, it would be the same as admitting that Meng Jianyuan had committed theft.

Yun Che spoke up before Meng Kongchan could respond, “Since you’re so confident, and the Chief Lord is overflowing with righteous anger, I guess I have no choice but to submit to the search.”

He added with a helpless sigh, “That said, you might have noticed that I don’t have any portable spaces with me. All I have is this dimensional ring. Check it as you please.”

He waved the dimensional ring he normally wore to hide the existence of the Sky Poison Pearl.

“Yuan’er,” Meng Kongchan spoke up, “no one can force you to do anything you don’t want to.”

He made his stance loud and clear in one sentence.

Yun Che smiled back at him. “I have not committed a crime, so why would I be afraid? Forget checking my portable space, I am fine even if my Divine Son Palace is turned upside down... assuming that the seekers are willing to pay the price, of course.”

“However,” Yun Che suddenly squinted and said in a mocking tone, “do be absolutely careful when you investigate my dimensional ring, Chief Lord. Considering your age, I do not want to give you a heart attack.”

Yun Che’s surprising calmness caused Meng Cangji to frown a little. However, he ignored his unease and said coldly, “This old one has seen far greater things in his long life than you, junior. There is nothing that can surprise me anymore.”

“That’s what I like to hear.” Yun Che opened his arms and said, “Do as you please, Chief Lord.”

Meng Cangji enveloped Yun Che in his profound energy in an instant. He checked multiple times and confirmed that the ordinary-looking dimensional ring was the only item giving off a spatial aura on Yun Che’s person.

Yun Che allowed the foreign profound energy to remove the dimensional ring from his hand and cut off his connection with it. Then, Meng Cangji began ejecting the items inside the dimensional ring pile by pile.

Clothes, pills, profound crystals... at first, the items falling out of the dimensional ring were perfectly ordinary. Then, Meng Cangji’s expression changed, and a unique radiance blasted out of the dimensional ring.

At that moment, everyone’s skin was dyed silver. The entire space was illuminated by a phantasmal moonlight.

It was... a Divine Jade of Revelation!

The small pool of unease that had gathered in Meng Jianze’s heart immediately erupted into pure, unadulterated joy. He nearly jumped on his face as he shouted with a tremor in his voice, “The Divine Jade of Revelation! Look! It’s the Divine Jade of Revelation!”

Many faces blanched under the blanket that was the abyssal crystal’s unique light. There could be no mistake. It was without a doubt the Divine Jade of Revelation.

Meng Chaoyang and Meng Chaofeng exchanged a glance and a hidden sigh with each other. Even though they knew that this was a trap, the fact was that Meng Jianyuan had stolen the Divine Jade of Revelation, and he was caught red-handed. At this point, the stain on Meng Jianyuan’s honor wasn’t just confirmed, but irremovable for as long as he lived.

“What else do you have to say for yourself, Meng Jianyuan?” Meng Cangji glared at Yun Che and rebuked him with over ten times the confidence he had displayed before.

“I understand that a shallow wanderer who has wandered the outside world for over a century like you would be tempted by the Divine Jade of Revelation. Had you obediently surrendered the stolen goods and accepted your rightful punishment, it would be an easy mistake to overlook. However, not only did you steal the Divine Jade of Revelation, you even tried to cover it up with a shoddy lie! This is a stain upon the honor of the Meng Clan! You may be the son of the Divine Regent, but this is not something even you may be forgiven easily!”

Meng Kongchan was staring at the Divine Jade of Revelation with a new expression as well, but it wasn’t surprise or anger that colored his face. It was... puzzlement?

“Chief Lord.” It was at this moment Meng Jianxi’s voice came from behind the old man. He said slowly and evenly, “When I first saw the Divine Jade of Revelation, I was so stupefied by its divine light that I forgot myself for a few breaths straight. Brother Yuan’s experience, cultivation, and mental fortitude are just as young as his age. It is only normal that he would lose himself to a moment of impulse.”

He said sincerely, “Since the item is retrieved, let this be the end of the incident, please?”

“Your Highness?” Meng Jianze wasn’t expecting to hear this at all. He turned around and glanced at Meng Jianxi with incomprehension.

All he got was a cold glare, however.

“Haha!” A cold chuckle interrupted the moment. It was Yun Che crossing his arms and saying leisurely, “Why don’t you check what else is inside the dimensional ring before you make a conclusion, Chief Lord? Who knows... there might be a bigger surprise waiting for you.”

“Hmph!” Meng Cangji harrumphed loudly. “You are caught red-handed, Meng Jianyuan, and you dare not bow your head still?! You—”

Suddenly, his voice came to an abrupt stop, and his face was completely frozen. A second later, it began twitching uncontrollably as if he just saw the most unbelievable sight in his life.

“Father? What’s wrong?” Meng Xuanji hurriedly stepped forward with concern.

Meng Cangji’s mouth opened and closed. It was a long, long time before he finally managed to squeeze out, “How... How in the...”

“Oh?” Yun Che chuckled amiably. “I thought you said that there is nothing in this Abyss that can surprise you anymore, my worldly Chief Lord? What could possibly make you eat your words?”

Incredibly, Meng Cangji did not refute him. Not only that, he was slowly turning to look at Yun Che with an expression that could almost be described as shock and horror. Naturally, everyone was surprised and confused by his reaction.

Yun Che continued to chuckle. “My, it seems like the Chief Lord is too shocked to pour out the remaining contents of my dimensional ring. It’s fine. This junior shall shoulder his senior’s burden.”

He made a pushing motion and released the space within the dimensional ring. There was a bright flash of spatial energy, and something landed right next to the Divine Jade of Revelation; something that boasted the exact same light, radiance, aura, and shape... it was yet another Divine Jade of Revelation!

Everyone’s eyes widened like saucers, but before their shock could even hit them, Yun Che casually moved his fingers again and summoned a third, fourth, fifth, sixth...

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The Dream Lords’ eyes widened so much it was a miracle they hadn’t split apart. Seven moonlight radiance; seven Divine Jades of Revelation had tumbled out of Yun Che’s spatial ring and hit the ground with a dull thud!

For a time, no one could say a thing. Meng Jianze’s mind went perfectly blank, and even Meng Kongchan was stunned by what he saw.

He might be the Dreamless Divine Regent, but not even he had seen so many Divine Jades of Revelation in his life. In fact, the one and only Divine Jade of Revelation that ever graced the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God was the one he had bestowed on Meng Jianxi.

Seven Divine Jades of Revelation shining together... This was a lavish moment not even the Pure Land could replicate without considerable, if not impossible effort!

This wasn’t the end, however. Yun Che waved his arm, and a pile of unusual lights blasted out of his spatial ring and pierced everyone’s eyes and souls.

Some lights were bright, and some were dim. Their colors and shapes differed from one another as well. However, everyone present still recognized the pile of items instantly. They were all mutated abyssal crystals that the Kingdoms of God unanimously called “extraordinary treasures”, and their auras marked them as on par with the Divine Jades of Revelation.

There were a total of twenty three of them.

This time, even Meng Kongchan reeled back half a step from his original spot.

“Is that... the Obsidian Evil Removing Crystal?” Meng Chaoyang muttered. “The Burial Star Jade... the Pale White Abyssal Crystal... and is that... that crimson abyssal crystal... the Primal Flame Crystal?”

“What? The Primal Flame Crystal?” Meng Chaofeng turned to stare at her sibling in absolute shock. “I thought that’s a fictional item that only exists in legends? It’s... actually real?”

The nine Dream Lords of the Dreamweaver of God were all Divine Limit Realm profound practitioners and boasted a vast wealth of knowledge and experience. They were all terrifying characters who were subordinate to none but a True God. And yet, right here and now, they were shaking from head to toe and making squeals of astonishment that did not fit their status or power at all. They looked like they were dreaming.

It wasn’t until Yun Che retrieved all of the mutated abyssal crystals that the Dream Lords jolted back to reality, though he left the seven Divine Jades of Revelation on the ground.

While everyone was staring at him like he was a monster, Yun Che stepped forward and picked up a Divine Jade of Revelation, saying, “My master was an incredible person. Before he passed away, he had left me a fair number of mutated abyssal crystals for my future growth and breakthroughs.”

“Right now, I still can’t use the Divine Jades of Revelation probably because their energy level is too high. That was why I normally used them like torches while journeying through the Endless Fog. They are quite effective. I normally called them Torch Stones. It wasn’t until now that I realized that they were called Divine Jades of Revelation.”

His remark was so ridiculous that the Dream Lords nearly sprained their lips.

While the Divine Jades of Revelation were illuminating Yun Che’s face, he side-eyed Meng Jianze and said, “Anyway, you were saying that I risked the wrath of a Divine Regent and the scorn of all just to steal a stone I normally used as a torch, Prince Jianze? Please, continue.”

“...” Meng Jianze’s mouth was opened wide enough to fit an egg. To say that the situation had completely surpassed his expectations would be an understatement. He was so shocked that he had forgotten how to speak; his heart and soul were in complete chaos right now.

It was the same for Meng Cangji. In his... and frankly, everyone else’s opinion, Meng Jianyuan should be a shallow wanderer who had never made contact with a divine object like the Divine Jade of Revelation. To his ilk, it should be something he didn’t even dare to imagine in his dreams. That was why it was perfectly rational to think that he would be tempted by it.

They could never have imagined that Yun Che would own not one, not two, but an entire pile of mutated abyssal crystals. It was such a number that it positively terrified them and made them wonder if they were in a dream.

If all these mutated abyssal crystals were invested in a single person... they could not even imagine the kind of monster it would produce in the near future .

Maybe, in the eyes of Divine Son Yuan... they were the amusing frogs in the well who threw a tantrum over a “mere Divine Jade of Revelation”.

No wonder Divine Son Yuan had looked bored, and lazy, while staring at them like they were a bunch of idiots.

As he said, why on earth would he debase himself by stealing the Divine Jade of Revelation Meng Jianze had obviously laid out as a trap?

Yun Che continued, “At Prince Jianze’s residence, his acting skills were so ‘sublime’, so ‘exquisite’, that I could not even be bothered to muster the breath to expose him. So, I gave the Torch Stone a cursory look before tossing back into its box. I also closed the jade box he had purposely left half-open... You saw it all on the Profound Imagery Stone.”

Yun Che shook his head with deep disappointment and scorn. “However, I never imagined Prince Jianze would lose his head over something so trivial and try to accuse me of a severe crime. As if that isn’t enough, his so-called ‘concrete’ evidence isn’t actually concrete at all! How terribly unassuming.”

“You’re lying! You’re lying!!” Meng Jianze’s complexion was beet red, and the bulging veins on his forehead threatened to pop open. “You took it... you could be the only one who took it! His Highness’ Divine Jade of Revelation must be among these even! This... This is all just a deliberate show to obfuscate the fact that you stole it!”

Yun Che cast him a sympathetic look. “You know it’s all too easy to find that Divine Jade of Revelation, right?”

He looked at Meng Kongchan and said, “This junior hasn’t known the Divine Regent for long, but I know enough that he is a meticulous and careful man. Therefore, this junior dares to guess that the Divine Regent planted a soul imprint on the Divine Jade of Revelation in the unlikely case someone got greedy enough to steal it.”

“That is correct,” Meng Kongchan replied affirmatively. “When I bestowed the Divine Jade of Revelation to Jianxi, I did, in fact, plant a soul imprint on it. It is shaped like a Xi character.”

Meng Jianxi looked visibly surprised. He had no idea the Dreamless Divine Regent had done such a thing—but then again, there was no way he could have detected the Dreamless Divine Regent’s handiwork.

“That’s perfect.” Yun Che cracked a smile. “With the soul imprint, I’m sure you already know where the Divine Jade of Revelation is, Divine Regent.”

Everyone turned to look at Meng Kongchan, and the Dreamless Divine Regent replied, “Yes, I knew where it was even before I came here.”

His eyes slowly shifted... until it came to a stop on Meng Jianxi.

As Meng Jianxi’s pupils dilated with unease, Meng Kongchan asked, “I’m only going to ask you one time, Jianxi. Jianze claimed that Yuan’er stole the Divine Jade of Revelation. Do you know where it is?”

Meng Jianxi’s head was buzzing with a million thoughts and emotions right now. He felt a fresh surge of fear and panic as he met Meng Kongchan’s calm, indifferent eyes and shook his head woodenly. “Father, I... don’t know. I really don’t.”

“...” Meng Kongchan did not say anything, but Meng Jianxi caught a flicker of emotion on his face. It looked... like disappointment.

It was then a silver silhouette rapidly approached the group and dropped to one knee beside Meng Kongchan. “Supreme one, I have found it.”

The silver silhouette held up a jade box, and it opened to reveal the moonlight radiance of the Divine Jade of Revelation.

“Where did you find it?” Meng Kongchan asked.

“Supreme one...” the silver silhouette bowed his head and replied clearly, “This one found it in Divine Son Jianxi’s residence.”

“...!?” Meng Jianxi wobbled on his feet. He could not believe what he was hearing.

Meng Jianze turned his head so fast that he nearly broke his neck as well.
