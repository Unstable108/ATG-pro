After the five had stepped into the Void-Shattering Grand Formation one after another, the gray spatial profound light instantly condensed but did not completely vanish. The entire formation continued to operate slowly in a hazy, gray glimmer. As its profound patterns flowed, they faintly exuded the supreme divine aura of the Abyssal Emperor. This was originally a gift bestowed by the Abyssal Emperor upon the six great God Kingdoms, yet the most powerful Asura God Kingdom was conspicuously absent—a fact that was undoubtedly lamentable.

Hua Fuchen’s gaze shifted to Meng Kongchan. He sent a sound transmission, “Brother Meng…”

Both were heavy with worry. The moment their eyes met, they understood each other’s thoughts and vanished in the same direction. Hua Caili, after all, had a simple disposition and little experience. She could not comprehend the bonds of friendship and sentiment her elders shared, which spanned over ten thousand years, nor could she read the heavy sorrow and heartache her Father God concealed beneath his calm exterior. Even Dian Luohou's anger was something she could only sense on the most superficial level.

Now that the younger generation had departed, Hua Fuchen and Meng Kongchan could finally drop their pretense of ease to confide in one another and discuss how to make amends. Meng Zangji, well aware of the Divine Sovereign's many worries, did not follow.

He walked to Meng Jianxi’s side and said coolly, “I wonder what the Divine Child Yuan is thinking. It has been less than twenty hours since he endured two hundred breaths of the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing, yet he insists on forcing his way into this perilous forbidden domain. And the Sovereign actually allowed him to do as he pleased.”

Meng Jianxi, however, replied, “Because Father God knows that Younger Brother Yuan must have his reasons for doing so. Since he is unwilling to speak of them, Father God will not press him. This is a unique trust Father God places in him alone.”

Meng Zangji’s old eyes gazed deeply at Meng Jianxi. He seemed to want to say something but held his tongue, ultimately just saying, “Let’s go.”

But Meng Jianxi’s feet did not move. He looked toward the Void-Shattering Grand Formation. “One can stay in the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain for seventy-two hours at most. This means our time in the Pure Land can also be extended significantly. Grandfather¹, you should go tour the Pure Land and visit old friends with my uncles². I must remain here. If Younger Brother Yuan encounters danger in the forbidden domain and escapes injured, I can be the first to assist him.”

Meng Zangji frowned slightly. It took a long while for his brow to relax, his expression complex and difficult to read. “Jianxi, does this mean… you’ve completely given up the fight?”

“Yes,” Meng Jianxi replied without a hint of hesitation.

He turned to face Meng Zangji’s gaze directly and said with utmost seriousness, “My initial decision to give up was because I could not win, nor did I dare to compete any longer. Father God's undisguised favoritism, Younger Brother Yuan's perfect godhead, and his astonishing talent and skill in the profound way… Coupled with the fact that he held the Empress Mother's fate in the palm of his hand, the sense of powerlessness was so heavy I could barely breathe. Reason compelled me to choose not to contend, to choose submission.”

“But back then, I was still forty percent unwilling.”

“Now, however, I am utterly convinced³, with not a single shred of resentment left.” Though these words sounded defeatist, he spoke them with such calm composure, even revealing a faint smile. “Especially after witnessing Younger Brother Yuan’s profound devotion and willpower today, I feel more and more that fate sending him back to us is the greatest blessing for my Dream Weaving God Kingdom. So, why should I continue to fight?”

“To stand by Younger Brother Yuan's side, to assist him in raising the Dream Weaving God Kingdom to a glorious future—is that not also an honor worthy of being etched into the annals of history?”

Staring at the unusual light in Meng Jianxi’s eyes, Meng Zangji finally nodded slowly. “Good. Since you have made your decision, I have nothing more to say. It’s just that, your past transgressions were quite severe. I fear…”

“Grandfather, what are you saying?” Meng Jianxi said with a smile. “Younger Brother Yuan's will was strong enough to withstand double the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing. How could he possibly care about such minor grievances from the past? Your worries are truly unnecessary.”

“Good, good!” Meng Zangji finally broke into a smile. “You’re right. We have all witnessed your excellence. For the Dream Weaving God Kingdom to have someone even more outstanding than you is not a heaven-sent calamity, but a heaven-sent blessing. Back then, our thinking was truly too narrow. Your uncles now feel the same as I do; it's just that they can't get over their old pride and lingering fear. It’s time I had a good talk with them.”

“The Eternal Pure Land, a new beginning for all kingdoms. With the two of you in the Dream Weaving’s next generation, we can truly feel gratified and at ease. With such a dazzling and promising future, we old fossils must also do our utmost, hahahaha.”

Abyssal Dust brushed against his face as Yun Che slowly opened his eyes.

Before him was a gray, hazy world. The light, the aura, the atmosphere—it was all just like the Sea of Fog.

However, the Abyssal Dust here was far denser than in the middle section of the Sea of Fog, perhaps even approaching the density of its depths. For others, to suddenly enter a forbidden domain submerged in Abyssal Dust from the Pure Land would be like falling from a clear spring into a mire; their profound energy and spiritual sense would be heavily suppressed, an incredibly uncomfortable feeling.

But for Yun Che, it was like a fish returning to the vast ocean. The spiritual pressure from the Pure Land completely dissipated, and every wisp of Abyssal Dust here could serve as a vessel for his spiritual sense.

“Huu—” He let out a long, slow breath and released his divine sense, blanketing the area around him.

Li Suo spoke softly, “It’s so quiet. Much quieter than the Sea of Fog.”

Yun Che replied casually, “That’s because there are very few Abyssal Beasts here, but Abyssal Ghouls are everywhere.”

And Abyssal Ghouls were nearly silent as they roamed.

“Don’t be in a rush to investigate the surroundings. Focus your mind and rest for a moment.” Li Suo’s voice grew even softer. “In the Pure Land, your soul strings were stretched too taut, and the soul wounds from the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing have not fully healed. This place is safe for you. At least allow yourself a moment to breathe.”

“Oh? Worried about me?”

“Yes.”

A faint smile touched the corners of Yun Che’s lips. He then obediently retracted his spiritual sense and let down his guard, sitting down on the ground. “Alright. How could I refuse the concern of a Creation God?”

Li Suo said no more, quietly watching Yun Che close his eyes to rest. However, she could clearly sense that his mind could never truly relax; at least thirty percent of it remained on high alert.

The shadow of an Abyssal Ghoul drifted near, but just as it was about to touch Yun Che, it abruptly turned and headed in another direction, soon disappearing into the vast gray fog.

Li Suo finally couldn’t help but ask, “Your thoughts are still in turmoil. What are you thinking about?”

Yun Che’s eyes remained closed as he spoke in a low voice, “I still can't get over why Mo Su was so unmoved by the miracle of life I displayed. I’ve thought back on my conversation with him, and he mentioned the words ‘will to die’ more than once.”

“So I’m thinking, perhaps more than the wounds inflicted by the Ancestral Sword, the death wish born from Pan Xiaodie's immense guilt and remorse is the true reason for her ‘slumber.’ And something like a death wish… that is indeed something even a miracle of life…”

His voice suddenly stopped, and he let out a sharp cry, “Who’s there?!”

BOOM—

The explosive sound wave, carrying a sudden burst of profound energy, violently shook the surrounding space. Dozens of cracks spread rapidly outward as Yun Che shot to his feet, provoking the sharp shrieks of countless Abyssal Ghouls in the distance.

Li Suo: “…!?”

A dark light shone in Yun Che’s eyes as his gaze swept the area like a hawk’s. But as far as his spiritual sense reached, he captured only pure Abyssal Ghouls and turbulent air currents.

One breath… two breaths… Li Suo finally asked, “What happened?”

His search yielded nothing, but Yun Che’s soul strings remained taut, his brows knitted tightly. “Someone was spying on me.”

Li Suo was briefly silent before saying, “Did you find the source?”

“…No.”

Li Suo said, “I didn’t sense anything. Moreover, the Abyssal Dust here is dense, which limits others’ spiritual sense, while yours is greatly enhanced. You could clearly detect Hua Qingying spying on you in the Sea of Fog, and besides, those who entered this forbidden domain with you are all in the God Annihilation Realm.”

Yun Che’s expression shifted slightly. His shout had not been a slip of the tongue. In the instant before he yelled, his spiritual sense had already radiated in all directions. An unexpected shout and burst of profound energy would have been enough to cause a ripple in any soul, no matter how well-hidden. Yet, his spiritual sense, extended to its absolute limit, had found nothing.

He was certain that if he had been spying on someone who suddenly shouted and released profound energy from a state of quiet rest, his own soul would have certainly jolted, be it lightly or heavily. It was impossible for there to be not the slightest ripple or trace.

Furthermore, this was a place dense with Abyssal Dust. And besides… that spying sensation had a faint, indescribable frailty to it.

After another long moment, Yun Che’s brow relaxed. He retracted his spiritual sense and let out a soft breath. “Perhaps I’ve been on edge for too long and have become a bit paranoid⁴.”

Perhaps… But the Devil Queen had warned him more than once that the one thing in this world that should never be ignored is a sudden “illusion.”

After this incident, Yun Che could no longer rest peacefully. He strode forward, his spiritual sense spreading silently around him. Unconsciously, an hour passed. He touched upon Xian Yue’s aura but immediately changed direction, heading toward a place where the Abyssal Dust was even denser.

In the direction he now walked, the concentration of Abyssal Dust rose abnormally, and the density of Abyssal Ghouls surged with it. After passing one Abyssal Ghoul after another, he finally stopped.

Ahead was a bottomless black abyss, churning with gray, dim Abyssal Dust so thick it was almost tangible. It was like the silently gaping maw of a demon that could noiselessly devour everything in the world.

Yun Che stared at the dark abyss, his brow furrowed, and muttered, “So this is… a Death Abyss⁵.”

It was common knowledge that at the center of the Sea of Fog lay an immense Primal Death Abyss. Within it was the densest, most primal, and most terrifying Abyssal Dust in the entire Abyss. The Primal Death Abyss was unique, but Death Abysses were not; much smaller versions existed sporadically in the depths of the Sea of Fog.

However, the depths of the Sea of Fog were home to Abyssal Beasts and Ghouls at the God Sovereign Realm, far beyond his current ability to control. He had ventured there only once and had returned in a sorry state, never daring to enter rashly again. Thus, this was the first time he had seen a real Death Abyss.

This Death Abyss was no more than a hundred yards wide, yet it silently emanated an indescribably terrifying aura. As Yun Che stared at it, his vision suddenly blurred, and an inexplicable impulse to leap down and return to eternal nothingness arose in his heart.

Yun Che violently tore his gaze away. He pushed out with his right hand, and a ball of fiercely burning Golden Crow flame shot toward the Death Abyss.

The moment the golden flame fell into the Death Abyss, its light and aura vanished instantly. There was no struggle or burst of power, not a single sound—it simply returned to nothingness in an instant.

Yun Che’s eyes narrowed slightly, a strange light flashing within them.

“A perfect disposal method, indeed.”

“Perfect… disposal method? What are you talking about?” Li Suo asked, confused.

“You’ll know soon enough.”

Before his words had even faded, Yun Che suddenly whipped his head to the right. The light in his pupils flared, and even his fingers curled involuntarily from excitement and agitation.

“Found her.”

Following Yun Che’s perception, Li Suo murmured the name, “Shen… Wu… yi?”

“Your insistence on coming here… was it all for… her?”

“Yes!”

Yun Che concealed his aura and moved through the layers of Abyssal Dust toward the source of the presence.

“…” Li Suo seemed stunned by this answer. After a long moment, she asked, full of confusion, “Why? Is it simply because you want to be near her, or do you want to try to awaken her memories?”

“I… do want to be near her. I want to, more than anything. I want to, regardless of the cost or consequences.”

This short sentence was laden with Yun Che’s incredibly heavy and complex emotions. But the him of this moment, the him in the world of the Abyss, was not purely Yun Che.

“However, my personal feelings and desires… can never take precedence over the safety of my homeland.”

Li Suo: “…”

“I sought an opportunity to be alone with her not because ‘Yun Che’ wants to be near her, but because ‘Emperor Yun’… needs someone to fight by his side.”

Li Suo’s soul rippled slightly, her voice as soft as faint smoke. “But the person she is now is not Xia Qingyue, but Shen Wuyi, who has no past. She doesn’t remember you or your homeland. Her only identity is the Divine Maiden of the Evernight God Kingdom. How could she possibly stand with you?”

“Besides… Mo Su specifically warned you that Shen Wuyan'ye has developed the intent to kill you. Shen Wuyi is very likely the one who will carry it out, and this place is undoubtedly the most perfect location for it.”

“Yes, I know,” Yun Che replied, completely unfazed.

Li Suo said no more. “It seems you have already decided what to do… I will wait and see if your wish comes true.”
