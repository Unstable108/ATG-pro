Kwooooosh!

A storm raged across the area.

The force Lee Gwak unleashed was no different from a small hurricane.

“Ghhk!”

“Argh!”

The fanatics of the Heavenly Fate Sect were swept up and thrown in all directions.

Some tried to muster every ounce of their internal energy to resist, but it was useless. The shock wave Lee Gwak created was far beyond what such meager skills could withstand.

Blood Storm

—a killing technique that strikes the ground with energy condensed into the blade, exploding outward.

Since first learning the Eight Sects Sword Art, Lee Gwak’s bladesman ship had evolved continuously.

Because of circumstances.

Because of necessity.

Through constant refinement and revision, it had become the Heaven Killing Blade.

The Heaven killing Blade was especially powerful in one-on-one combat, capable of holding its own against any supreme master. But in chaotic battles against many enemies, it lacked efficient forms.

So he created the Blood Storm.

Its power was overwhelming.

Dozens of martial artists were swept away by the shockwave, their conditions utterly wretched. Their limbs twisted grotesquely, and horrible wounds gaped across their bodies.

This level of brutality was unlike Lee Gwak’s usual self.

When he first arrived at the Heavenly Fate Sect, he had no intention of resorting to such cruelty. But the horrific sights he had witnessed on the way changed his mind.

Everywhere the sect ruled was nothing short of hell.

He didn’t know exactly what their doctrine was, but people distrusted each other, and not a shred of basic humanity remained.

Sect members raped women at will, and orphans flooded the streets.

Smiles had disappeared from people’s faces, replaced only by suspicion in their eyes.

They were alive only in their bodies – souls trapped in hell.

All of it was because of the Heavenly Fate Sect.

More precisely, because of Cheon-un-ja, a single man.

Lee Gwak saw with his own eyes how much evil one villain could inflict on the world.

Killing Cheon-un-ja alone would not be enough. The entire sect had to be wiped out to prove that Heaven’s law still lived.

Lee Gwak stepped over the fallen bodies without a glance and walked toward the Cheon-un-ja.

“Ugh…”

A pained groan escaped Cheon-un-ja’s lips.

His eyes, fixed on Lee Gwak was filled with unmistakable fear. He tried to remain composed, but facing Lee Gwak’s overwhelming prowess made it impossible to fully suppress his terror.

“Stop him! Now!”

Cheon-un-ja shoved his disciples forward, but they too were petrified.

They exchanged nervous glances, hesitant to advance.

“Idiots!” Cheon-un-ja shouted. “If we don’t bring him down, we all die! Attack him, now!”

Only then did the faltering disciples grasp reality and attack Lee Gwak.

“Die!”

“Hyaaah!”

They attacked with everything they had.

At that moment, Lee Gwak stomped on the ground.

Like a swallow gliding over water, his body shot forward.

Swish!

A flash of blade light bloomed.

The tail it left behind vanished in a blink.

The bodies of the martial artists in its path swayed unsteadily before collapsing all at once.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Like puppets with their strings cut, the Heavenly Fate Sect’s disciples sprawled across the ground, motionless.

“Ugh…!”

Cheon-un-ja trembled uncontrollably at the unbelievable sight.

His eyes, fixed on Lee Gwak, were filled with terror.

To him, Lee Gwak looked like the God of Death himself.

Staggering backward, he shouted,

“W-wait! Let’s make a deal!”

“A deal?”

“I’ll offer you all the wealth I’ve gathered—just spare my life!”

“……”

Lee Gwak didn’t respond.

There was no value in answering.

Reading Lee Gwak’s resolute expression, Cheon-un-ja hastily made another offer.

“Then—you take over as the leader of the Heavenly Fate Sect! I’ll serve as your deputy! Wealth, women, power—it’ll all be yours!”

When Lee Gwak still didn’t answer, Cheon-un-ja grabbed Jo So-hye, who was nearby, and thrust her forward.

“Look! A fresh young girl! You can have her—or any woman you desire! If you don’t like the name ‘Heavenly Fate Sect,’ we can change it! Countless people will worship you forever! I swear it! I’ll pledge my loyalty to you—just spare this old man!”

His face was twisted in groveling desperation.

Using Jo So-hye as a shield, he inched closer to Lee Gwak.

Cheon-un-ja had completely assumed a posture of submission.

Lee Gwak’s gaze shifted to Jo So-hye, who was being pushed forward.

She was gritting her teeth.

Her eyes burned with venomous hatred toward the Cheonunja.

Just moments ago, she had been utterly hopeless.

To her, Cheon-un-ja had been the most terrifying being in the world—a devil who held the power of life and death.

Seeing that same devil cower helplessly before Lee Gwak didn’t bring her joy—only misery.

The fact that so many people had suffered and fallen because of such a wretched creature filled her with sorrow.

Suddenly, Lee Gwak’s voice reached her ears.

“Come here.”

It was clearly directed at her.

In that instant, Cheon-un-ja tightened his grip around her neck.

An instinctive act – he could not afford to lose his only shield.

Jo So-hye gasped as the choking pressure cut off her breath—but only for a moment. The grip soon loosened, and she could breathe again

Lee Gwak extended his hand toward her.

Without thinking, she took it.

As Lee Gwak pulled her forward, she was freed.

When she looked back at Cheon-un-ja, he stood frozen like a statue.

Jo So‑hye sensed that Lee Gwak had subdued him.

Indeed, Lee Gwak had blocked the old man’s key acupuncture points.

Cheon-un-ja was a skilled martial artist, but he was no match for Lee Gwak.

Moreover, he was old and hadn’t practiced martial arts in so long that he had forgotten how to fight.

Stripped of his title as cult leader, Cheon-un-ja was nothing more than a powerless, cunning old man.

Lee Gwak had exposed his true nature for all to see.

Jo So-hye stared blankly at Cheon-un-ja.

“All because of someone like you…”

She bit her lip until it bled.

She was furious.

Countless lives had been ruined because of this wretched man.

Peaceful families had been torn apart, ordinary people dragged into the abyss with no escape.

All of it—because of the pathetic old man before her.

Without realizing it, she picked up a sword lying on the ground—one dropped by a fallen cult martial artist.

The weight of the blade made her delicate body sway.

It was too heavy for a young girl. But she refused to let go.

When one hand wasn’t enough, she gripped it with both. Even then, the weight was almost unbearable.

Dragging the sword, she approached Cheon-un-ja.

Lee Gwak watched her with complex emotions in his eyes.

The young girl’s gaze was filled with venom. Though he didn’t know exactly what horrors she had endured, he could sense the depth of her hatred.

What she wanted was revenge.

For a moment, Lee Gwak wondered if he should stop her.

Jo So-hye couldn’t have been more than fifteen or sixteen—maybe even younger.

Was it right to stain such a young girl’s hands with blood?

Once someone took a life, there was no going back.

Returning to innocence would be impossible.

Then, he saw tears streaming down Jo So-hye’s cheeks.

Even as she sobbed uncontrollably, she refused to let go of the sword.

“Huu…”

At that moment, Lee Gwak made his decision.

Swoosh!

He sheathed Star Soul and released the Cheon-un-ja’s pressure points.

He left Cheon-un-ja’s fate in Jo So-hye’s hands.

Realizing what was happening, Cheon-un-ja pleaded with her.

“Spare… me.”

“You killed my parents.”

“I didn’t kill them! If you want revenge, shouldn’t you take it on the one who kidnapped you?”

“Of course I’ll make him pay too. But that doesn’t mean I’ll let you go. You’re responsible for all of this.”

Drip… drip…

Tears streamed down her face as she struggled to raise the sword.

The tip trembled, aimed squarely at Cheon-un-ja’s heart.

“N-no! You can’t!”

Cheon-un-ja screamed and looked at Lee Gwak in despair.

When words failed with Jo So-hye, he turned back to Lee Gwak for mercy. But Lee Gwak remained impassive, showing no reaction.

He was a mere observer now.

When no hope came from Lee Gwak, Cheon-un-ja tried to break free by channeling his qi.

But the more qi he drew, the more his channels turned to stone—Lee Gwak’s technique held fast.

Jo So-hye’s sword drew closer.

Still unable to break free, Cheon-un-ja roared in desperation.

“If you lay a finger on me, I’ll haunt you as a vengeful spirit! You’ll suffer my curse forever! If you don’t want that, you’d better let me go now!”

He spewed curses too vile to repeat, veins bulging on his forehead as he screamed. His face twisted into something truly demonic.

But Jo So-hye’s eyes showed no fear.

Sssk!

Her sword pierced Cheon-un-ja’s chest.

His pupils trembled violently, the cold steel on his flesh adding to his terror.

Slice…

The sensation of the sharp blade slicing through his muscles was vivid.

Jo So-hye was still a young girl. Naturally, her strength was far below that of an adult, so the sword moved slowly.

But paradoxically, that only intensified Cheon-un-ja’s fear.

He could feel every fiber of his flesh being torn apart.

With great effort, her sword finally reached his heart.

The cold metal pressing against his pounding heart drove his terror to its peak.

“P-please!”

This time, Cheon-un-ja begged.

Tears welled in his wrinkled eyes and snot ran down his nose. His appearance was pitiful.

Jo So-hye lowered her head and pushed the sword in with all her strength.

Stab!

“Keuk!”

The blade pierced his heart, and Cheon-un-ja let out a bloodcurdling scream.

Blood gushed from his chest, splattering across Jo So-hye’s face. She stared blankly at his convulsing body.

“Y-you…?”

Cheon-un-ja stared at her with wide eyes, then fell backwards like a rotten log.

Thud!

It was the end of the cult leader who had plunged the entire region into hell.

“Ah…!”

As her tension had finally snapped, Jo So-hye’s eyes rolled back, and she fainted.

Lee Gwak caught her collapsing body gently.

“Gwak!”

“Uncle!”

Seok Yi-cheon and Pi Jin-ui rushed to Lee Gwak’s side.

Seok Yi-cheon was dragging a middle-aged man—the one who had kidnapped Jo So-hye.

When he saw that the situation was getting worse, he tried to escape from the Heavenly Fate Sect. But Seok Yi-cheon caught him.

Although Seok Yi-cheon was only an outer hall leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance, to ordinary people he was no different from the Grim Reaper.

Subduing the man had been as easy as flipping his palm.

“Please, spare me!”

The man begged desperately.

“Crash!”

But Pi Jin-ui was faster—he brought his axe down on the man’s head.

This man had also harmed Pi Jin-ui’s family. There was no hesitation in his strike.

“Aaaah!”

Pi Jin-ui threw down his axe and let out an angry roar.

“Huu…”

Lee Gwak and Seok Yi-cheon sighed in unison.

Their breath scattered on the wind.

Today marked the final day of the Heavenly Fate Sect.
