Lee Gwak frowned.

O Cheol-geuk’s proposal had been unexpected.

“As you may or may not know, our Green Heaven Society is expanding at an incredible rate. If things continue like this for just a few more years, we’ll surpass Sky High Castle, Green Heaven Society is the true stronghold of the Green Forest. I would like to invite you, Great Hero, to join us. I will offer you a position second to none—please become our Vice Captain.”

Oh Cheol-geuk regained his usual confident expression.

He was certain that Lee Gwak would accept his proposal. That’s how highly he regarded the Green Heaven Society.

But the answer that came back from Lee Gwak was far from his expectations.

“I must decline.”

“What did you say?”

Oh Cheol-geuk momentarily thought he had misheard. Lee Gwak’s reply was that unexpected.

His expression turned icy.

“May I ask why? Is it that the Green Heaven Society doesn’t meet your standards?”

“Not just the Green Heaven Society—I have no intention of joining any sect.”

Lee Gwak said decisively.

Oh Cheol-geuk glared at Lee Gwak with a fierce gaze for a moment. He felt that Lee Gwak was dismissing him.

“I’m curious whether you would have given the same answer if Sky High Castle had made the same proposal.”

“Even if it were the Jade Heaven Alliance making the offer, my answer would be the same.”

“You are an arrogant man. Well, considering your martial prowess, I can understand that confidence. But in the Jianghu, there’s a clear limit to what an individual can achieve. No matter how strong one is, a single hand cannot block ten hands. I hope you reconsider your decision.”

“No matter how many times you ask, my answer will remain the same.”

“You’re as stubborn as they say.”

Oh Cheol-geuk’s gaze grew even colder.

Since establishing the Green Heaven Society, he had enjoyed unbroken success. His self-confidence soared to the heavens because of it.

He had absorbed and nurtured the Green Forest Bandits who were dissatisfied with the strong policies of Sky High Castle, expanding his influence to form a formidable force envied by none. Yet, he still felt an unquenchable thirst.

That was the absence of an absolute master.

There were many martial artists of similar skill, but no one strong and symbolic enough to serve as a focal point.

For the Green Heaven Society to grow further, they needed such a martial artist.

Then, he heard that their Vice-captain Yuk Dal-hon, had attacked the Sanghyeon Escort Agency but was defeated by Lee Gwak.

Instead of getting angry, Oh Cheol-geuk saw it as a golden opportunity.

Until his sudden disappearance three years ago, Lee Gwak had enjoyed a fiery reputation for his incredible martial prowess.

Though his fame was often dismissed as short-lived, his martial prowess was indisputable.

In fact, Yuk Dal-hon, his most trusted subordinate, couldn’t even determine what techniques Lee Gwak had used.

Yuk Dal-hon was exceptional in both skill and insight.

For someone like Yuk Dal-hon to be unable to gauge Lee Gwak’s abilities meant that Lee Gwak’s martial arts were extraordinarily superior. He was exactly the person Oh Cheol-geuk was looking for. Therefore, he personally traveled a long way to meet him.

He naturally expected Lee Gwak to say yes Therefore, Lee Gwak’s refusal felt even more shocking.

Having traveled so far to secure Lee Gwak, his anger was only intensified.

“One last time—are you truly refusing to join the Green Heaven Society?”

“I’ll answer you one last time. I will never join the Green Heaven Society.”

“Grr!”

Unconsciously, O Cheol-geuk gritted his teeth.

He wanted nothing more than to subdue and humiliate Lee Gwak, but Lee Gwak’s unknowable strength instilled a deep fear in him.

Though he had built Green Heaven Society into a massive organization, it was through resourcefulness, not martial skill.

In terms of pure martial ability, he was no match for Lee Gwak.

No matter how angry he was, he couldn’t attack Lee Gwak here. Moreover, this wasn’t even the Green Heaven Society’s territory.

The Thousand Kingdom School’s martial artists were spread throughout the streets. If he lost his temper and attacked Lee Gwak here, his own life could not be guaranteed.

Oh Cheol-geuk suppressed his anger and cupped his fists.

“I hope you won’t regret your decision. Then, I will take my leave. Have a pleasant night, Great Hero Lee.”

With that, he quickly exited the guest house.

Lee Gwak watched O Cheol-geuk’s silhouette disappear into the night.

“Who knows how many more people like him exist in this world.”

As the conflict stretched on, many harbored empty ambitions like O Cheol-geuk. Already, two of the Ten Sects had fallen, and others aimed to fill those gaps.

Ja-Hong-cheon believed that with the fall of the Ten Sects, all authority would naturally consolidate under the Jade Heaven Alliance. But he was gravely mistaken.

Human desire was endless; whenever one spot was vacated, another contender appeared. After the fall of the Zealous Justice Clan and the White Light Sect, new groups already emerged, claiming leadership over the Green Forest.

O Cheol-geuk of Green Heaven Society was one such aspirant.

Due to them, the world was descending into greater chaos—far beyond Jade Heaven Alliance’s control.

No one could have foreseen this level of disorder resulting not from the Celestial Demon Troupe but from the Jade Heaven Alliance itself.

Lee Gwak shook his head and returned to his room.

Fortunately, Lee Cheong was still sleeping soundly.

Lee Gwak quietly looked at Lee Cheong’s face.

It was astonishing.

The fact that a child existed who looked so much like him.

Lee Gwak gently touched Lee Cheong’s face.

“Mmm!”

A contented smile appeared on Lee Cheong’s face, and a faint smile emerged on Lee Gwak’s as well.

In that moment, he could forget all his worries.

＊＊＊

Early the next morning, Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong left the guesthouse.

Learning of their departure, Namgung Jin and Namgung Yeon-hwa came to see them off.

“Are you really leaving already? We hardly had time to get to know each other…”

Namgung Jin’s face was filled with regret.

He had been so busy with the reconstruction of Chaohu that he didn’t have a moment to spare. So he hadn’t even had a chance to invite Lee Gwak for a drink.

Now that things had finally settled somewhat and he had some free time, he felt even more regretful when Lee Gwak said he was leaving.

Namgung Yeon-hwa cautiously spoke up.

“Couldn’t you stay for just a few more days?”

“I’m sorry, Miss Namgung.”

“But we haven’t even fully repaid our debt to you…”

“Receiving the White Spirit Divine Pill is more than enough.”

“But…”

Namgung Yeon-hwa bit her lip.

She knew about the mistakes committed by Namgung Hoe, so she had nothing to say. It was regrettable that because of the White Spirit Divine Pill, the opportunity for a natural connection with Lee Gwak had disappeared.

Namgung Yeon-hwa couldn’t persuade Lee Gwak any further and looked at him with eyes full of regret.

Lee Gwak looked at Namgung Jin

“Then, I’ll be on my way.”

“Please feel free to visit the Thousand Kingdom School whenever you like.”

“I will do so.”

Even though Lee Gwak said he would consider it, he had no real intention of visiting the Thousand Kingdom School.

Lee Gwak spoke to Lee Cheong.

“Let’s go.”

“Yes!”

The two mounted their horses.

Namgung Jin held Namgung Yeon-hwa’s hand and stepped back. Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong slightly bowed their heads to the siblings and rode off.

Thud, thud, thud!

The horses quickly left Chaohu behind.

Once they were out of Chaohu, the stifling tension began to lift.

Lee Cheong’s face brightened.

Being confined to the guest house, he had been eager for freedom.

Despite his maturity, he was still a young boy. The open road was naturally appealing to him.

Even the horses, enjoying the freedom after a long time, ran tirelessly for a while. Because of that, they even had to calm the horses down.

Snort!

When they stopped galloping and made them walk, the horses neighed loudly. They didn’t seem to calm down.

“You’ve been frustrated, I’ll let you run again, but just a little slower.”

Lee Cheong whispered as he stroked the horse’s thick neck. The horse slowly stopped trotting.

Lee Gwak silently watched his son communicate with the horse.

In their rush to leave Chaohu, he hadn’t yet given Lee Cheong the White Spirit Divine Pill. He planned to do so tonight in a quiet place.

Given the rare elixir, there was no reason not to use it.

It was then that Lee Gwak’s expression stiffened.

He sensed a significant number of presences nearby.

“Cheong-ah!”

“Yes?”

Lee Cheong looked at Lee Gwak with a puzzled expression.

“Be careful. There’s an ambush.”

“What?”

Lee Cheong’s face hardened.

Swish!

Just then, Lee Gwak heard a faint sound, like a reed rustling in the wind.

With lightning speed, he drew his blade and swept it through the air, creating a powerful gust.

Countless tiny needles were swept up into the air by the gust and then fell harmlessly to the ground.

“Ox Hair Needles?”

They were called Ox Hair Needles because they resembled the fine hairs of an ox.

They were so thin and fine that they were difficult to handle, but once mastered, few projectiles were as effective.

Because they were so fine, they made almost no sound when thrown.

Lee Gwak looked in the direction from which the needles had come.

At that moment, dozens of masked figures charged at him and Lee Cheong.

Their faces were entirely covered, leaving only their eyes visible, dressed in black martial uniforms.

‘Assassins!’

They wore the typical attire of assassins.

Without saying a word, they attacked Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong directly.

Lee Gwak’s eyes narrowed.

The assassins’ attacks were focused more on his son, Lee Cheong, than on himself. It was clear that they thought Lee Cheong was his weakness.

Swish!

Lee Gwak’s sword cut through the air like a thunderbolt.

Two assassins charging at Lee Cheong were cut in half at the waist. They died instantly without even a scream.

Swoosh!

Lee Gwak sprang off his horse, prompting more assassins to hurl weapons at him. Yet none of them reached his body, falling away instead.

Lee Gwak had swung his blade in a large arc to create a momentary blade barrier.

The thin Ox Hair Needles could not penetrate Lee Gwak’s sword barrier. However, it was true that his movement was slightly delayed because of it.

The assassins did not miss that fleeting moment, and two of them charged at Lee Cheong.

Shhh!

They immediately unleashed lethal techniques.

From the beginning, their target was only Lee Cheong.

Their client’s objective was clear: eliminate Lee Cheong.


---


Their strike was aimed mercilessly at Lee Cheong’s throat. To these assassins, ending the life of a mere ten-year-old was as easy as breathing.

They had no doubt they would extinguish Lee Cheong’s life in an instant. However, contrary to their expectations, Lee Cheong was no ordinary boy.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Lee Cheong unfolded the Eight Sects Sword Art, blocking their offensive.

A look of bewilderment appeared in the eyes of the assassins who had been careless, thinking he was just a child.

In the meantime, Lee Gwak arrived.

Swish!

“Ugh!”

“Argh!”

Lee Gwak’s blade instantly severed their lifelines.

That was only the beginning.

He didn’t care if they targeted him, but he could never forgive those who aimed for his son’s life.

Swish!

With each swing of Lee Gwak’s blade, an assassin met his death, his blade carrying an ominous, almost supernatural cry. In seconds, half of the assassins lay dead by his hand.

“Ugh…”

“Ahhh!”

Only then did fear appear in the eyes of the remaining assassins.

They had never imagined Lee Gwak would possess such overwhelming strength.

His prowess was beyond anything they’d encountered—another dimension entirely. There was no way they could break through his defense to reach Lee Cheong.

“Damn it! To think he’d be this strong…”

The assassins’ gazes wavered.

Taking advantage of the chaotic times, countless assassin groups and mercenary organizations had sprung up like mushrooms after the rain.

The Jade Heaven Alliance and the Seven Sects hired assassins and mercenaries to supplement their lacking forces. Because of that, assassin groups and mercenary organizations were enjoying unprecedented prosperity.

The Black Killing Squad was also an assassin group that had emerged in such a way.

They had received the commission this morning.

The client had paid several thousand nyang of gold to assassinate the father and son leaving Chaohu today. They specifically ordered that the son’s life must be taken without fail.

When they accepted the commission, the Black Killing Squad had no doubt they would complete the assassination.

No matter how strong Lee Gwak was, they thought they could succeed if they divided his attention.

Although the risk was quite significant, they judged that completing the commission would grant the Black Killing Squad blazing fame. That’s why they accepted a commission with high risk.

However, Lee Gwak’s martial prowess far exceeded their expectations.

They couldn’t see any way to break through him and approach Lee Cheong.

It was as if a giant fortress wall was blocking their way.

They felt dizzy and disoriented.

As Lee Gwak approached them, he asked,

“Who commissioned you?”

His calm voice was chilling to the bone.
