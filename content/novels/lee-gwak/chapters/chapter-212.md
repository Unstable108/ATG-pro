When Lee Gwak opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was the ceiling. It was still dark, suggesting it was before dawn.

Despite the desire to stay in the warmth of his blanket, Lee Gwak got up and went outside.

The world was still enveloped in darkness.

Standing alone in the courtyard, Lee Gwak looked up at the night sky.

Not a single star was visible, likely due to the heavy clouds.

A sense of loneliness, as if he was the only one in the world, washed over him like a tidal wave.

Since reclaiming his home, many people had come by.

Nam Woo-Gyeong, Lim So Bo, the members of the 13th squad, and even those seeking to recruit him.

No matter how many people he met and interacted with, the emptiness did not easily disappear. It had been a while since he returned home, but every day he woke up feeling the same hollowness.

Lee Gwak exhaled deeply and reached out his hand towards the room. Then, as if pulled by an invisible string, the blade in the room flew into his hand.

As he drew his blade, a silver light gleamed distinctly in the darkness.

Lee Gwak began to move across the yard, swinging his blade.

There was no particular form to his movements.

He simply swung, thrust and drew the blade as he pleased. His movements were concise, without any unnecessary action.

The blade slicing through the darkness formed a single line.

Each of his actions flowed like waves, creating a graceful line.

Lee Gwak was no longer confined to the six movements taught by Gwang Noh-ya.

If he wished to thrust, he thrusted; if he wished to cut, he cut.

He simply let his mind flow and his body move as it willed.

The cut grass, which had been gathered in one place, swirled around his body like iron filings drawn to a magnet.

His movements became faster and more fluid. The grass circling around him also spun faster.

It was as if the grass had its own will, following Lee Gwak’s actions.

The wind gathered around him, but Lee Gwak himself was unaware of it, lost in a state of absolute concentration.

The battles with Woo Mun-Pae, the fierce fight with Moon Gwang, and the confrontation with Yong Cheon Myeong had a profound impact on Lee Gwak.

The experiences accumulated little by little directed the path Lee Gwak needed to take, and he was making progress accordingly.

With each extension of his blade, an unseen force surged forth and receded, repeating the cycle.

Initially, the movement was slow, but later, it became swift and free, following Lee Gwak’s will.

Only when the twilight of dawn began to fade did Lee Gwak cease his movements.

His whole body was drenched in sweat, and heavy breathing escaped his lips involuntarily. However, the emptiness that had been present in his face before the dawn was nowhere to be found.

Lee Gwak went to the well to douse himself with cold water.

The sweat washed away, leaving him feeling refreshed.

After drying off his drenched body hastily, Lee Gwak left the house. By dawn, the streets were already bustling with people.

Although he walked among the people, no one paid him any attention.

Despite his reputation as the Sura Blade echoing through the Jianghu, very few actually knew Lee Gwak’s face. This allowed him to wander freely among the people.

After walking for a while, he arrived at the slum in the northern part of the outer city. This was where Nam Woo Gyeong’s old residence was.

Just as Lee Gwak had returned to his home, Nam Woo Gyeong had also moved from the Crimson Flower Brother to this place. Being in the Crimson Flower Brother inevitably made him aware of other people’s eyes.

When Nam Woo Gyeong moved his residence, Cheol Gwang Woo also had to move. Leaving the fragrance-filled Crimson Flower Brother was a secret sorrow for Cheol Gwang Woo.

As Lee Gwak entered, Cheol Gwang Woo was the first to greet him.

“Yes! I’m learning a lot by following brother Woo Gyeong .”

“Your Vajra Demon Shadow Technique seems stable.”

Cheol Gwang Woo was surprised and widened his eyes.

Perhaps because he had been diligently reading the sutras, Cheol Gwang Woo had managed to control his madness to some extent. Moreover, his proficiency in the Vajra Demon Shadow Technique had improved immensely compared to before.

Cheol Gwang Woo had never once revealed his level of skill or discussed it outside, not even with Nam Woo Gyeong, who was always by his side. So, it was natural for him to be surprised when Lee Gwak recognized it instantly.

Lee Gwak smiled and patted Cheol Gwang Woo’s shoulder.

In truth, he was just as surprised.

He hadn’t intended to, but the flow of qi around Cheol Gwang Woo was visible to him.

Cheol Gwang Woo’s qi was much more organized and stable than before. It was evidence of his mastery of the Vajra Demon Shadow Technique.

“He’s inside, talking with Miss Sobo.”

“Yes! She arrived in a hurry about half an hour ago. She looked anxious.”

A crease formed on Lee Gwak’s forehead.

At that moment, Nam Woo Gyeong and Lim So Bo came out from inside.

The countenances of the two greeting Lee Gwak were somber.

“It seems something has happened?”

“Yes! The young fox brought some unwelcome news early this morning.”

“Depends on how you interpret it.”

Nam Woo Gyeong frowned and looked at Lim So Bo, who stepped forward to explain.

“This morning, distressing news was received across the Jianghu.”

“Several key figures of the Ten Sects were assassinated.”

“Yes! All the assassinated individuals were renowned masters in the Jianghu. Naturally, they were well-guarded, but they were all assassinated.”

Lee Gwak murmured thoughtfully.

Nam Woo Gyeong added more information.

“Our information network also picked up on the assassinations. It seems far more martial artists were assassinated than what the Jade Heaven Alliance has identified.”

“Yes! I suspect the Blood Rain Assassins might be active again.”

“Why would they suddenly become active after being quiet for so long?”

“Someone must have hired them. The question is who. The Ten Sects are in turmoil over a series of assassination incidents.”

Nam Woo Gyeong’s expression was grave.

Having narrowly escaped assassination by the Blood Rain Assassins, he took the series of events very seriously.

“If it was just a vendetta, it would be fortunate, but if the Celestial Demon Troupe has commissioned these assassinations, the situation would be dire.”

“There’s no need to worry yet since nothing is certain. The young fox and I will figure out the full story of this situation. You don’t need to concern yourself.”

“If the Blood Rain Assassins have indeed resumed activities, they might target you, brother.”

“That’s why I stick to Gwang-Woo like a leech, isn’t it? Haha!”

Nam Woo Gyeong exaggeratedly joked.

“I will protect the brother Woo Gyeong with my life, so no worries.”

Cheol Gwang Woo loudly declared, slapping his chest with his large hands.

Nam Woo Gyeong slung his arm over Lee Gwak’s shoulder.

“Isn’t it still before the meal? Let’s go eat together. I know a good place nearby, let’s go.”

Lee Gwak nodded and followed him out.

“Are you going to treat me too?”

“You can buy your own, young fox. You get plenty of money from the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“Are you going to be stingy like this?”

“This young fox, starting from the morning…”

“I’ll buy with my own money then.”

The two bickered from the morning onwards.

Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo both sighed in unison, watching the two bicker.

Their argument continued even after they arrived at a street food vendor, but there was no malice in their voices.

It was more like a habit. The smiles lingering on their lips while they argued were proof of that.

Regardless of their bickering, Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo focused on their meal.

Cheol Gwang Woo’s appetite was impressive from the morning. A mountain of empty bowls had piled up in front of him.

Lim So Bo exclaimed in astonishment, temporarily forgetting their argument.

“He’s not human. He’s an ox. Because of him, the finances of the Hao Clan are nearly bottoming out.”

Nam Woo Gyeong grumbled, putting down his spoon.

Though he complained, there wasn’t any real reproach in his expression. Having Cheol Gwang Woo’s escort for merely the cost of his meals was practically a steal.

The breakfast concluded only after Cheol Gwang Woo had devoured almost all the rice in the restaurant. Lim So Bo returned to the Secret Court, and Nam Woo Gyeong, along with Cheol Gwang Woo, returned to Hao Clan.

Once again left alone, Lee Gwak was about to move on when someone blocked his path.

An old man of indeterminate age stood before him. His scrawny frame, clad in a red robe, looked almost comical and shabby, like an overturned sack. But Lee Gwak neither laughed nor underestimated him.

It was because of the sharp aura emanating from the elder.

To Lee Gwak, this elder’s aura felt more threatening than any martial artist he had encountered so far.

‘Was there such an elder in the Jade Heaven Alliance?’

At least, among the martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance that Lee Gwak had seen, there was no such elder.

A smile formed on the elder’s lips.

“Just as I’ve heard, your martial arts skills are considerable. There’s no need to be so guarded. I have no intention of harming you.”

“Yes. From now on, you may refer to me as Elder Seok.”

“What business does Elder Seok have with me?”

“I have no business with you. It’s the leader of the alliance who wants to see you.”

“Yes. The leader wishes to see you.”

Lee Gwak’s brow furrowed slightly at the old man’s sudden words.

He had thought that such a day might come eventually, but he hadn’t anticipated it arriving so soon.

Side by side, the two made their way towards the Jade Heaven Alliance.

“If it’s not too rude, may I ask about your status, Elder?”

At Lee Gwak’s question, Seok Pa-Cheon turned to look at him.

To an ordinary person, the elder’s sharp gaze might have caused their legs to tremble as it swept over Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak did not avoid Seok Pa-Cheon’s gaze.

Though the elder’s eyes were fierce, they could not compare to those of his master, Gwang Noh Ya. Having trained under Gwang Noh Ya for six years, such a gaze was not a significant threat to Lee Gwak.

Seok Pa-Cheon’s lips curved into a faint smile, seemingly pleased with Lee Gwak’s reaction.

“You have quite the backbone, young man. Very well. Normally, I do not disclose my status to just anyone, but I admire your spirit and will tell you. I am a member of the Heavenly Martial Squad.”

Surprise flickered in Lee Gwak’s eyes.

Despite having been affiliated with the Jade Heaven Alliance for a long time, he had never heard of such an organization.

Sensing Lee Gwak’s confusion, Seok Pa-Cheon continued.

“The first leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance had seventeen sworn followers. They served the leader and played a significant role in a surprise attack on the Celestial Demon Troupe, contributing to a monumental victory. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that their efforts led to victory in the war against the Celestial Demon Troupe. Even after the war, they did not return to their respective sects, but remained with the Jade Heaven Alliance. They each had only one descendant to whom they passed on their martial arts. They are the “Heavenly Martial Squad”.

“So, you’re a descendant of the sworn followers.”

“Indeed. The Heavenly Martial Squad only acts upon the leader’s orders when the Jade Heaven Alliance faces a crisis.”

“Then, your presence here means the Jade Heaven Alliance is in crisis?”

“No. My being here is entirely of my own volition. I wanted to see you with my own eyes.”

“If there was a threat to the Jade Heaven Alliance, I intended to eliminate it with my own hands before the leader met you.”

Elder Seok did not hide his intent.

It showed his confidence in his own martial prowess and indicated he did not perceive Lee Gwak as a threat.

‘Descendants of the sworn followers. That means there are sixteen more martial artists like this elder.’

Lee Gwak could now truly appreciate the immense strength of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

The aura emanating from Seok Pa-Cheon was more formidable than any of the martial artists Lee Gwak had seen in Jade Heaven Alliance. To think there were sixteen more individuals like him was astonishing, even to someone as unflappable as Lee Gwak.

Elder Seok looked directly at Lee Gwak and said,

“Do you understand why I’m telling you this?”

“Is it a warning not to act recklessly?”

“Exactly. You’re smarter than what I’ve heard. I can see why the leader is concerned about you.”

“I’ll take that as a compliment.”

Elder Seok’s eyes lit up at Lee Gwak’s composed response, but he said no more.

Following Elder Seok, they soon arrived at the leader’s quarters.

Lee Gwak’s expression stiffened slightly.

Entering the Blue Dragon Hall, known as the leader’s quarters, was a first for him. Such an occurrence was unthinkable when he was an outer hall martial artist.

As they entered the leader’s quarters, the atmosphere changed.

The air around the area seemed to sharpen like blades, swirling around Lee Gwak.
