“Haa…”

A woman dressed in black robes and a black veil let out a low sigh. Her entire body was drenched in sweat and blood.

A thick haze was rising from her body—a phenomenon caused by the release of internal heat.

Eventually, unable to bear the stifling sensation, she removed the veil covering her face. Revealed was a beautiful figure blending masculine and feminine features.

Her intense gaze and sharp jawline gave her the appearance of a man, yet her finely sculpted nose and red lips were captivating.

The woman sat on a broken stone statue and gazed ahead.

Just two hours ago, the largest manor in the vicinity now lay in ruins, billowing smoke.

On the signboard, broken in half, the three characters “Cho Family Manor” were clearly inscribed.

The Cho Family Manor, a martial family with a two-hundred-year legacy, held the strongest influence within a three-hundred-li radius.

The manor’s master, Cho Moon-gang, was a supreme martial artist known for his excellent character and unyielding integrity that did not tolerate injustice.

Because he never compromised with wrongdoing and never turned away from those in need, he was deeply respected by the local residents.

Even the Ten Sects dared not treat Cho Family Manor recklessly and showed them proper respect. Yet, such a place had fallen.

The woman suddenly looked down at her hands.

Her rough, calloused hands, stained with blood, seemed almost incompatible with the idea of feminine hands.

The blood of Cho Moon-gang, the lord of Cho Family Manor covered her hands—she had been the one to end his life.

“Sigh…”

The woman sighed again.

Her name was Dan Li-yeon.

Dan Li-yeon, the Dark Martial Empress

She was the third disciple of Ja Hong-cheon, the leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance, and famously known as the Martial Maniac.

Up until three years ago, Dan Li-yeon had devoted everything to martial arts. She lived in an optimal environment where she could focus solely on honing her skills without worrying about anything else.

She thought she had been happy back then.

At least during that time, she hadn’t stained her hands with the blood of others without purpose.

The Jade Heaven Alliance was an object of respect, and as the third disciple of the alliance Leader, she too was showered with admiration and love.

But now, everything had changed.

Her hands were never free from blood, and people looked at her with eyes filled with fear.

She was no longer called the Dark Martial Empress. She was now known as the Blood Martial Empress, and had become one of the most feared figures among the enemies of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Cho Family Manor had sided with the Thousand Kingdom School and opposed the Jade Heaven Alliance. That was the reason it was annihilated.

‘How did it come to this…?’

She had lost count of how many people’s blood had stained her hands.

She was no longer a martial artist.

She was merely a tool executing the orders of her master, Ja Hong-cheon.

The curses Cho Moon-gang had uttered before his death still echoed in her ears.

—”How has the Jade Heaven Alliance fallen so low? You’ve lost the spirit of the great first leader, Cho Yeon Woon. You are no longer worthy of the name Jade Heaven. Even in hell, I shall curse you all.”

The sight of Cho Moon-gang, his white beard stained crimson, glaring at her, was impossible to forget.

Because of that, Dan Li-yeon couldn’t lift her head for a while, needing to suppress her emotions.

As she somewhat calmed down, a man quietly approached her.

He was in his late thirties with a cold demeanor.

A deep scar etched on his right cheek made his features appear even sharper.

“Mission accomplished, Miss Dan Li.”

Only then did Dan li-yeon lift her head to look at him.

His icy gaze met hers.

His name was Ok Mu-yeon, leader of the Ghost Sword Squad.

The Ghost Sword Squad was one of the elite forces directly under the alliance leader, assigned by Ja Hong-cheon to support Dan Li-yeon.

Ok Mu-yeon was known as the Ice Soul Ghost Sword, famed for his ruthless nature.

While Dan Li-yeon had confronted and killed Cho Moon-gang herself, it was Ok Mu-yeon and the Ghost Sword Squad who annihilated the Cho Family Manor.

Dan Li-yeon asked Ok Mu-yeon,

“Any survivors?”

“About a dozen escaped from the manor. But our men are pursuing them, so we’ll hear good news soon.”

The “good news” he referred to was, of course, the death of the survivors.

“They’ve already lost everything. Is there really a need to go that far? Call back your men.”

“I cannot do that.”

“Leader Ok!”

“Even if it’s you, Miss Dan Li, I cannot comply with that order. Operating the Ghost Sword Squad is entirely under my jurisdiction.”

“Are you refusing my command?”

“As I said, the operation of the Ghost Sword Squad is my sole authority granted by the alliance leader. While I can cooperate with you, I cannot accept unilateral orders.”

“Haah!”

Dan Li-yeon let out a deep sigh and stood up.

Perhaps because it was a unit directly under the alliance leader, Ok Mu-yeon’s attitude was extremely rigid. He didn’t hesitate to refuse Dan Li-yeon’s orders, just as he was doing now.

Swish!

Dan Li-yeon swung her hand toward Ok Mu-yeon. Startled by her unexpected attack, he quickly drew his sword to defend himself.

Clang!

A metallic sound rang out as Ok Mu-yeon’s body slid backward.

He barely managed to block her attack, but the impact tore his wrist guard, and fresh blood trickled down.

“What are you doing?”

“If you won’t listen to words, I have no choice but to use force.”

“Miss Dan Ri, if you proceed like this, I won’t stand idly by.”

“You won’t stand still? It seems you’ve underestimated me because I’ve been treating you kindly, but I’m not that lenient.”

Dan Li-yeon brushed her hair back with a white hand.

Her face was full of irritation.

She didn’t particularly enjoy using violence to subdue people. But when necessary, she never hesitated.

Whoosh!

Dan Li-yeon’s palm opened wide, and a tremendous force of attraction surged, pulling his body toward her.

“Ugh!”

Ok Mu-yeon gathered his internal energy to resist, but it was futile. Dan Li-yeon’s internal energy was beyond what he could handle.

“Hyah!”

In the end, Ok Mu-yeon stopped resisting and instead used the pulling force to charge at her.

Swish!

His sword aimed for her vital points.

‘I won’t kill you. But I will bring down that high nose of yours.’

Ok Mu-yeon unleashed his deadly technique, the Ghost Blood Seven Swords.

A single hit from this technique could tear flesh and bone apart—a truly vicious and powerful move.

He used this lethal skill, which he would never use except against a life-or-death enemy, against Dan Li-yeon. He presumed that, given her martial prowess, she wouldn’t sustain serious injury.

Bang!

At that moment, a powerful explosion erupted, and Ok Mu-yeon’s head snapped back.

His neatly combed hair became disheveled, and blood flowed from his nose and mouth.

Ok Mu-yeon staggered.

In just one strike, his senses were knocked out.

He couldn’t even comprehend what technique Dan Li-yeon had used. The intense impact had left his mind half gone.

While he was dazed, Dan Li-yeon’s fists rained down on his entire body. She was executing one of her ultimate techniques, the Empty Sky Shadowless Fist.

She struck Ok Mu-yeon with a technique reserved for enemies, even though he was her ally.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Explosions sounded continuously as Ok Mu-yeon’s body swayed like a reed. Dan Li-yeon precisely controlled her strength to prevent him from collapsing.

Blood splattered, and flesh was torn.

Ok Mu-yeon had already lost consciousness. Yet he remained on his feet, enduring the brutality of her blows.

“Ugh!”

“Leader…”

The members of the Ghost Sword Squad watched the horrifying scene, their bodies trembling.

They were notorious for their cruelty, but even they didn’t dare to confront Dan Li-yeon’s terrifying display of violence.

Such was the overwhelming nature of her martial prowess.

Thud!

Soon after, Ok Mu-yeon’s body collapsed like a pile of rotten straw. His appearance was so gruesome that one would dread even seeing it in a nightmare.

His face was so battered it was unrecognizable, and his entire body was covered in dark bruises.

Had she not controlled her strength to avoid breaking bones or damaging internal organs, Ok Mu-yeon would have been dead. Even if he survived, he would have suffered severe aftereffects for the rest of his life.

Dan Li-yeon spoke to the Ghost Sword Squad members.

“Take him away. And tell those pursuing the Cho Family Manor survivors to return.”

“Understood.”

The squad members moved quickly.

“Haah!”

Dan Li-yeon sat back down on the broken statue and sighed.

Her body was fine, but her mind felt like it had reached its limit. It was as if her spirit was being chipped away bit by bit, leaving only an empty shell.

That dreadful feeling made her shudder.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheon rode their horses at a leisurely pace.

Having galloped vigorously earlier, the horses were still breathing heavily, unable to calm down quickly.

Lee Cheong stroked his horse’s neck gently, concern evident on his face. Lee Gwak, on the other hand, silently led his horse forward.

It had been three days since they left Chaohu, yet he hadn’t found a single clue about Ki Jin-hwi’s whereabouts.

“I suppose we’ll have to go to the Hao Moon.”

At least at Hao Clan, he might find some leads on Ki Jin-hwi. He also thought of meeting Nam Woo-Gyeong while he was there.

Thinking of Nam Woo-Gyeong brought a smile to Lee Gwak’s face.

He realized he’d been rather neglectful. Despite being out in the Jianghu for some time, he was only now thinking of Nam Woo-Gyeong.

Seeing the smile on his father’s face, Lee Cheong asked curiously,

“What’s making you smile?”

“It’s nothing. I just felt like smiling.”

At his father’s reply, Lee Cheong also grinned.

Since embarking on their journey together, the two had grown even closer.

They could now understand each other’s thoughts just by exchanging glances.

As they shared a laugh, a rustling sound came from the bushes ahead.

Rustle!

Their faces grew wary.

Having already been attacked by assassins once, they couldn’t help but be cautious.

Suddenly, something burst out from the thicket.

It was a boy with tattered clothes and disheveled hair.

Having run through the thicket, his face and body were covered in scratches.

The boy, upon seeing Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong, ran toward them, shouting.

“Please, help me!”

The boy’s face was streaked with tears, sweat, and blood. Just by looking at him, one could tell how desperate his situation was.

Lee Gwak dismounted and quickly held the boy.

“What happened?”

“Please save me. The people who destroyed my family are trying to kill me, too.”

“Your family?”

Lee Gwak looked puzzled, but he had no time to ask questions.

“We found you!”

“Got you, you little rat!”

Two men emerged from the bushes.

They had been pursuing the boy.

As they approached Lee Gwak, one of them spoke.

“We are from the Jade Heaven Alliance’s Ghost Sword Squad. We’re on official business, so hand over the boy and leave.”

“Ghost Sword Squad?”

Lee Gwak tilted his head, puzzled.

Though he had been with the Jade Heaven Alliance for a long time, he had never heard of such a group.

‘Must be one of the secret units directly under the alliance leader.’

The Jade Heaven Alliance had numerous secretive organizations he didn’t know about, many of which carried out sensitive or unsavory missions in secret.

Since they’d openly identified themselves as the Ghost Sword Squad, they wouldn’t let him go even if he handed over the boy. Units like theirs avoided revealing their identities whenever possible.

Lee Gwak glanced at the boy.

“What’s your name?”

“I’m Cho Ryu-jin. My father is Cho Moon-gang, the master of Cho Family Manor.”

“I see. Stay with my son for a moment.”

The Ghost Sword Squad members exchanged glances, surprised by Lee Gwak’s casual demeanor.

Even though they had identified themselves as part of the Jade Heaven Alliance, he showed no fear. They felt something unsettling about his composure.

Most martial artists would tremble upon hearing the name of the Jade Heaven Alliance, fearing any association with them. Only those with considerable background or confidence in their skills would dare act like Lee Gwak.

Sling!

The Ghost Sword Squad drew their swords.

They felt uneasy, but retreat wasn’t an option. The command from their leader, Ok Mu-yeon, was absolute.

Without a sound, they lunged toward Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak had his back turned to them as he was helping Cho Ryu-jin onto the horse. The Ghost Sword Squad, true to their name, wielded their swords like ghosts. They were especially effective in ambushes and surprise attacks of this kind.

Their swords swiftly neared Lee Gwak’s waist and neck.

‘Got him.’

‘It’s a success.’

Just as victorious expressions crossed their faces, a sharp slicing sound tore through the air.

“What?”

Suddenly, darkness enveloped their vision.
