“Here it is.”

Ki Jin-hwi looked at the shabby mansion in front of him with a serious expression. The rundown mansion at the dead end of the alley looked as if it could collapse at any moment. Yet, without any hesitation, he stepped inside.

“How may I help you?”

As he reached the front gate, a scruffy man, appearing to be in his early thirties, blocked his path. However, Ki Jin-hwi did not panic and answered calmly.

“I came to do some gambling.”

“Gambling? You should head to a gambling house for that. Why come to this dilapidated place?”

The man gave him an incredulous look, but his eyes gleamed sharply.

Sensing the man’s reaction, Ki Jin-hwi was certain he had found the right place.

“I’m here for a big game. If possible, I’d like to play on a red table draped with a golden cloth.”

“Did you say golden cloth?”

“Yes.”

Ki Jin-hwi reaffirmed confidently.

Opening the gate, the man said, “Who referred you? A golden cloth is quite a high-level introduction.”

Those who utilized the Hao Clan’s information were largely divided into two groups: those who sought it out themselves and those introduced by insiders.

The “Golden Cloth” signaled that Ki Jin-hwi had been introduced by someone of high rank within the Hao Clan, at least someone at the elder level.

The person who had taught Ki Jin-hwi this code was Lee Gwak, and Lee Gwak, of course, had learned it from Nam Woo-gyeong.

Even within the Hao Clan, information was categorized into levels, and to access reliable intel, one had to provide the correct code.

The man led Ki Jin-hwi into the mansion, where there was a large door leading further inside. Ki Jin-hwi expected to go through it, but instead, the man lifted a cloth hanging beside the main door. A hidden, small side door appeared.

The large door led to the gambling den, while the side door led to the branch leader’s office of Hao Clan.

Pointing to the side door, the man said, “Please enter through here.”

“Thank you!”

Ki Jin-hwi bowed and entered through the side door. Inside was a narrow corridor that seemed to stretch on endlessly, far longer than the mansion’s size would suggest.

“It must lead underground.”

The downward slope was gentle but noticeable.

After walking for a while, he arrived at a fairly large room where a sharp-eyed woman awaited him.

“There’s a guest before you, so please wait a moment. Once they leave, you may enter.”

“Understood!”

Ki Jin-hwi nodded and sat in one of the small chairs provided in the room.

The conversation of the earlier guest seemed to drag on, requiring him to wait for quite some time.

‘I hope she’s okay.’

Ki Jin-hwi thought of Han So-cheon.

Han So-cheon was hiding in a dilapidated farmhouse on the outskirts of the village, posing as a guest.

Considering the pursuit by the Hidden Blood Squad, it was a perilous move, but they had no other choice.

They couldn’t continue heading north indefinitely. They needed to know exactly where Lee

Gwak was to formulate a more detailed plan. That’s why Ki Jin-hwi came here.

Creak!

A sound broke his reverie.

Finally, those who had been inside opened the door and emerged. Upon seeing them, Ki Jin-hwi’s face hardened.

One man and two women.

‘Experts!’

Just a single glance made his skin crawl; the aura and atmosphere they emanated were anything but ordinary.

The man carried an enormous greatsword on his back, nearly as large as his torso. The sword’s sheer size and weight were intimidating enough to command attention.

Despite carrying such a massive weapon, the man moved lightly. It was a weapon only someone with incredible skill, stamina, and strength could wield.

The women accompanying him were equally extraordinary.

The woman walking ahead wore a white veil covering her face below the eyes, radiating an inexplicable, mysterious aura.

Just looking at her strangely calmed and purified one’s mind.

Ki Jin-hwi’s gaze shifted to the other woman following behind. The moment he saw her face, his pupils shook.

‘Could it be? No, it can’t be. Why would she be here…?’

The woman behind also wore a veil covering half her face, just like the one in front. Yet, Ki Jin-hwi recognized her because even her veiled appearance was familiar.

He looked at the following woman again.

‘It’s definitely her. She’s Lee Seon-ja.’

Six years ago, Ki Jin-hwi had accompanied the envoy to Seize Fortress. At that time, the woman who had come from the Celestial Demon Troupe to guide the envoy was none other than Lee Seon-ja.

‘Then the woman ahead is perhaps the Saintess?’

Ki Jin-hwi’s gaze returned to the woman leading.

If Lee Seon-ja was escorting someone, it could only be the Saintess, an elder of the Celestial Demon Troupe.

“Um!”

Unknowingly, Ki Jin-hwi let out a low groan.

These figures he had unexpectedly encountered were beyond what he could handle.

At that moment, perhaps hearing his groan, Lee Seon-ja looked his way.

“Why are you looking at me like that? Have we met before?”

“Ah, no. You were so beautiful… I couldn’t help but look. If I made you uncomfortable, I apologize.”

“Hmph!”

At his reply, Lee Seon-ja scoffed and walked past him.

Thud!

It was only after they had left that Ki Jin-hwi put his hand over his pounding heart. At the same time, he felt foolish.

During his time with the envoy, he had been just an ordinary outer hall martial artist—unremarkable with no notable presence. It was practically impossible for Lee Seon-ja to remember someone she had only seen once.

He was like someone startled by a mere rope after seeing a snake.

Calming his racing heart, Ki Jin-hwi pondered.

‘Why are martial artists from the Celestial Demon Troupe out in the Jianghu?’

Just then,

“Please, you may go inside now.”

The Hao Clan woman opened the door for him.

Ki Jin-hwi nodded and entered.

Though his startled heart hadn’t fully settled, now wasn’t the time to dwell on Lee Seon-ja or the woman accompanying her.

Inside, a middle-aged man appearing to be in his early fifties sat dressed in plain clothes. He was Gu Hak-seo, the branch manager of this Hao Clan branch.

With a weary expression, he spoke, “Who might you be? Who referred you?”

“My name is Ki Jin-hwi. The person who taught me how to contact this place is none other than ‘Sura Blade’ Lee Gwak.”

“Lee Gwak? Did you just say Lee Gwak?”

Gu Hak-seo’s voice rose.

For a moment, Ki Jin-hwi tensed. Gu Hak-seo’s reaction was more intense than he had anticipated.

“How do you know him?”

“I was in his squad when I was part of the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“Then you were in the 13th squad?”

“Yes.”

At Ki Jin-hwi’s answer, Gu Hak-seo’s eyes sparkled. The fatigue evident moments ago vanished without a trace.

Gu Hak-seo briefly searched his memory.

Lee Gwak was a significant figure specially managed by the Hao Clan. Not only was he a renowned figure in the Jianghu, but he also had a close relationship with Nam Woo-gyeong, Hao Clan’s young master. Because of this, the Hao Clan gave him special attention.

As a result, branch managers were expected to have basic knowledge about Lee Gwak’s past and his associates.

Ki Jin-hwi matched perfectly with the information in Gu Hak-seo’s mind.

To be sure, he asked a few more questions, and Ki Jin-hwi accurately answered details only those in the 13th squad would know.

Only then did Gu Hak-seo confirm that the man before him was indeed Ki Jin-hwi.

“So, what brings you here?”

“Could you tell me where the squad leader is currently?”

“According to the latest information, he’s at Mount Yeo.”

“Mount Yeo?”

“That’s what he personally said when he visited a Hao Clan branch.”

“He said it himself?”

“Yes.”

Ki Jin-hwi furrowed his brow slightly.

If Lee Gwak personally left such information, it meant he wanted someone to trace his whereabouts.

Ki Jin-hwi asked tentatively, “Is the squad leader perhaps searching for someone?”

“How did you know?”

“I thought so.”

“You’re correct! He’s searching for someone.”

“Would that someone be Han So-cheon?”

At Ki Jin-hwi’s response, Gu Hak-seo unconsciously stood up. His face was filled with astonishment.

“How do you know that? Could it be…?”

“I’m with her.”

“Is that true?”

“It’s certain.”

Upon Ki Jin-hwi’s confirmation, Gu Hak-seo’s legs gave way, and he collapsed back into his seat.

Recently, an order had come from Hao Clan’s leader, Nam Woo-gyeong, instructing all branches to actively cooperate with Lee Gwak.

Consequently, all Hao Clan branches were gathering information to locate Han So-cheon, whom Lee Gwak was seeking. However, due to her elusive nature, they hadn’t obtained any reliable information yet.

“Is Miss Han safe?”

“She has sustained some internal and external injuries, but she’s capable of moving without issues.”

“That’s a relief. You came to bring Miss Han to Lee Gwak, didn’t you?”

“Yes.”

“Then head straight to Mount Yeo. I’ll inform Lee Gwak immediately. If I send a messenger pigeon to the nearby branch, the message will reach him quickly.”

“By the way, did you confirm if the squad leader is with the children?”

“He’s reportedly traveling with two children. They seem to be his own.”

“Phew! Thank goodness.”

“Is there anything else I can assist you with?”

“If possible, could you help divert information? There’s a pursuer.”

“A pursuer?”

“The Hidden Blood Squad of the Jade Heaven Alliance is after her. We’ve managed to put some distance between us, but they’ll likely catch up soon.”

“Hmm! That’s a tricky situation. While our clan’s intelligence network is impressive, the Jade Heaven Alliance’s is equally formidable. But I’ll do my utmost.”

“Thank you. Currently, we’re located at…”

“Wait! Please don’t tell me.”

“Pardon?”

“If the Jade Heaven Alliance is pursuing her, this place might not be safe either. So, please don’t disclose your location to anyone—even me.”

“Understood.”

Ki Jin-hwi nodded.

He realized Gu Hak-seo was trying to prevent any unforeseen complications.

Suddenly, a look of relief spread across Ki Jin-hwi’s face.

He had hoped that if Lee Gwak was searching for Han So-cheon, he might use the Hao Clan, which was why he’d come. He hadn’t expected to learn Lee Gwak’s whereabouts so readily.

Ki Jin-hwi stood up.

“I should return to Miss Han now.”

“Indeed. I need to dispatch the messenger pigeon promptly.”

“Ah!”

“What’s the matter?”

“May I ask why the group that was here earlier visited?”

“Why do you ask?”

“I believe I might know them.”

“Hmm!”

Gu Hak-seo hesitated.

Disclosing customer information was taboo in the Hao Clan. Unless under special circumstances, they should never reveal details about their clients. However, the earnest look in Ki Jin-hwi’s eyes made him waver.

“They were searching for someone.”

“Who might that be?”

“I’m afraid I can’t disclose that. It’s the clan’s policy; I hope you understand.”

“Ah, I see.”

Ki Jin-hwi let out a sigh.

He wanted to inquire further, but Gu Hak-seo’s firm expression deterred him.

“I’m sorry for making an unreasonable request.”

“No, I’m the one who should apologize.”

“Then, I’ll take my leave.”

Ki Jin-hwi stood up.

Though he felt some regret, he couldn’t afford to spend more time here. He promptly exited the Hao Clan’s branch.

Flutter!

A messenger pigeon soared above his head.

Ki Jin-hwi watched the pigeon disappear into the distance before heading toward where Han So-cheon awaited.

He moved cautiously, ensuring no one was tailing him or that there were no suspicious individuals nearby. After walking for quite a while, he arrived at the rundown farmhouse on the village outskirts.

Before leaving earlier, he had set up a formation around the farmhouse. Because of this, even Ki Jin-hwi had to be careful when entering. A single misstep could trigger the formation against him.

Swish!

As soon as Ki Jin-hwi stepped inside, he felt a chilling sensation against his neck. Looking down, he saw a cold blade pressed to his skin.

“Miss Han, it’s me, Ki Jin-hwi.”

The wielder of the sword was Han So-cheon.

Upon sensing someone entering, she had instinctively concealed herself and prepared to strike—a reflex ingrained into her very being.

Han So-cheon withdrew her sword with an apologetic look.

“Phew! I’m sorry.”

“It’s alright.”

“How did it go at the Hao Clan?”

“Fortunately, it went well. The squad leader is currently at Mount Yeo.”

“And the children?”

“Both are reportedly with him.”

“Ah!”

A sigh of relief escaped Han So-cheon’s lips.

Ki Jin-hwi smiled gently as he watched her.

Drip! Drip!

Dark red blood dripped down the large sword.

“Ugh!”

The massive greatsword, as large as a person’s body, had pierced through none other than Gu Hak-seo, the Hao Clan branch manager. Gu Hak-seo stared incredulously at the man wielding the sword—the same guest who had earlier visited with two women. One of the women spoke.

“I knew I recognized him from somewhere. He was the martial artist who came with the envoy.”

The speaker was Lee Seon-ja.

She had later recalled Ki Jin-hwi’s face and returned with her companions. She demanded that Gu Hak-seo reveal the purpose of Ki Jin-hwi’s visit and his whereabouts.

Naturally, Gu Hak-seo refused. The consequence was the massacre of the entire branch.

All the Hao Clan martial artists present were slaughtered by the man wielding the greatsword, and Gu Hak-seo, unable to withstand the torture, divulged everything.

The man glared fiercely at the dying Gu Hak-seo. His eyes burned with a savage fury.

Gritting his teeth, he muttered, “So, the assassin who killed my master is nearby?”

The woman who had remained silent until now removed the veil covering her face and approached him.

With eyes holding the wisdom of the world, the woman was none other than Gu Mun-hye, the Saintess of the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Gu Mun-hye addressed the man, “Warrior Baek!”

The man wielding the greatsword was Baek Hwi-yong.

Though affiliated with the Celestial Demon Troupe, he was a man unbound by any of its rules.

His master was Yang Sang-wol.

Yang Sang-wol was the elder brother of Yang Gwang-baek, leader of the Ten Blood Demons and one of the greatest martial artists of Celestial Demon Troupe. Even the leader of Celestial Demon Troupe, Jin Gwang-hon, had deeply respected him.

Traditionally, Yang Sang-wol’s martial lineage passed down to only one successor. Consequently, he yielded everything to his younger brother, Yang Gwang-baek, and lived a life of seclusion.

Yang Sang-wol had taught Baek Hwi-yong a unique martial art he had developed through his own enlightenment in later years, rather than the original lineage. He had also advised him not to be bound by the sect but to live freely.

Six years ago, Yang Sang-wol was assassinated by a killer who had come as part of an envoy to the Celestial Demon Troupe. Since then, Baek Hwi-yong had tirelessly sought his master’s murderer. Today, he had finally caught the assassin’s trail.

Baek Hwi-yong looked at Gu Mun-hye with emotionless eyes.

“It seems that finding the Young Master is a task for you, Saintess, and Lee Seon-ja.”

“But…”

“Now that I know my master’s killer is nearby, I cannot simply pass by.”

The thick killing intent in Baek Hwi-yong’s voice caused Gu Mun-hye to tremble slightly.

“Sigh!”

Her sigh echoed through the blood-soaked Hao Clan branch.
