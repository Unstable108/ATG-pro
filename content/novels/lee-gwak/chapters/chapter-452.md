The Jade Heaven Alliance thoroughly concealed the fact that Seize Fortress had fallen.

The siege was their pride. And its collapse was was akin to the collapse of the alliance’s dignity.

After a series of failures and Ja Hong-cheon’s injury, the Jade Heaven Alliance had no strength left to counter Celestial Demon Troupe’s attacks. That’s why, even when they heard news that Seize Fortress was under assault, they couldn’t send reinforcements in time.

While they wasted time, Seize Fortress fell, and the Jade Heaven Alliance lost its key stronghold in the west.

By the time the alliance managed to muster reinforcements, it was already too late.

Naturally, the Alliance was thrown into chaos.

They scrambled to devise countermeasures, but after pushing themselves too hard in the war, they had no resources left.

Even if they tried to coordinate with other sects, their past sins made it impossible to boldly request cooperation.

It was the worst possible situation.

In the end, they adopted a passive strategy: to hold out and search for a solution rather than actively resist the Celestial Demon Troupe’s invasion.

Because of this strategy, it took a full month before the Jianghu learned of the fall of Seize Fortress.

Merchants delivering supplies were horrified to find Seize Fortress in ruins, and the news spread like wildfire.

Upon hearing of Seize Fortress’s collapse, the sects of the Jianghu busied themselves with countermeasures, but none of them had a clear solution.

They resented the Jade Heaven Alliance for letting things deteriorate to this point and recalled all their active disciples.

Without the unifying force of the Jade Heaven Alliance, they believed their only option was to survive on their own.

Though the season had passed the height of summer, the Jianghu was entering winter.

Martial artists closely watched the Celestial Demon Troupe’s movements. But contrary to their expectations, their forces remained invisible.

Many began to hope that the rumors might be false.

Then it happened.

As if to shatter their hopes, the martial artists of the Celestial Demon Troupe finally revealed themselves.

The place they appeared was Dongin, a border region near Hunan Province where the Jade Heaven Alliance was based.

Dongin was a small county nestled between Dragon Heaven Valley and the Jade Heaven Alliance, lacking any notable martial sects.

It was a spot vulnerable to a joint attack from Dragon Heaven Valley and the Jade Heaven Alliance.

For that reason, it had been overlooked by all. But the Celestial Demon Troupe struck precisely where no one expected.

Their movement was stealthy. They broke their forces into small units and infiltrated along various routes.

As a result, the Jianghu was entirely unaware of their operations.

When news spread that the Celestial Demon Troupe had set up a base in Dongin, many martial artists scoffed.

They believed the Celestial Demon Troupe would crumble under a joint attack before they could establish themselves. But it didn’t take long to realize how wrong they were.

Just as the Celestial Demon Troupe’s forces appeared in Dongin, another unit attacked Dragon Heaven Valley.

The Celestial Demon Troupe boldly split their army. Unless they were supremely confident in their strength, such a strategy would be unthinkable.

While the Jianghu was fractured and embroiled in conflict, the Celestial Demon Troupe had steadily built their power. They had accumulated such overwhelming strength that fighting on two fronts simultaneously was possible.

The one immediately in danger was Dragon Heaven Valley.

“What are the enemy’s numbers?”

“Still unclear. But they likely outnumber our main force.”

“Damn it…”

Upon hearing her subordinate’s report, Mok Seon-wol bit her lip.

Dragon Heaven Valley had been closely monitoring the Celestial Demon Troupe’s movements. Especially after learning of Seize Fortress’s fall, they had intensified their surveillance.

Yet, despite their efforts, the Celestial Demon Troupe appeared right at their doorstep and set up camp.

With the situation dire, the Celestial Demon Troupe [a] went on high alert.

They had never imagined the Celestial Demon Troupe would execute such an audacious plan.

She immediately summoned Dragon Heaven Valley’s elders to devise countermeasures.

Fortunately, Dragon Heaven Valley had always prepared for war, allowing them to quickly establish a defense.

Days later, the Celestial Demon Troupe launched a full-scale assault.

“Charge!”

“Capture Dragon Heaven Valley!”

The Celestial Demon Troupe’s forces surged toward Dragon Heaven Valley like a tidal wave.

“Hold the line at all costs!”

“If the defense falls, our families will die. Fight to the last breath!”

The Dragon Heaven Valley’s warriors fought desperately.

A single clash left countless casualties.

The entrance to Dragon Heaven Valley was littered with an uncountable number of corpses.

Though they suffered heavy losses, the Dragon Heaven Valley held firm against the Celestial Demon Troupe’s assault. They leveraged their terrain and utilized long-prepared mechanical traps to endure.

In the end, the Celestial Demon Troupe retreated with significant losses. However, no one believed that this was the end.

The war had only just begun.

The Celestial Demon Troupe regrouped, signaling a second attack, while the Dragon Heaven Valley barely had time to collect their dead before preparing for the next assault.

Days later, the Celestial Demon Troupe struck again, and the two forces clashed violently.

Despite suffering many casualties again, the Celestial Demon Troupe were unable to defeat the Dragon Heaven Valley.

The Dragon Heaven Valley’s resilience was astounding. Despite being outmatched, they held their ground. However, everyone knew that time was not on their side.

The question was: how long could Dragon Heaven Valley hold out?

All anyone could do was hope they lasted as long as possible.

In truth, Dragon Heaven Valley displayed incredible endurance, resisting wave after wave of attacks from Shinmaryeon [b] .

And so the time of hardship passed.

Seasons changed several times.

During that time, the Jianghu became even more chaotic.

As the war between the Celestial Demon Troupe and the Jade Heaven Alliance dragged on, casualties mounted, and collateral damage spread.

The Celestial Demon Troupe cleverly avoided provoking other forces. They focused solely on the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Dragon Heaven Valley.

As a result, many sects remained bystanders. Since they were unaffected, they were reluctant to get involved in a war.

They knew this was the Celestial Demon Troupe’s intent, but that knowledge didn’t make them eager to join.

While Celestial Demon Troupe and the Jade Heaven Alliance traded blows, Dragon Heaven Valley was isolated. Overall, however, the Jade Heaven Alliance was losing ground.

The alliance had long lost the hearts of the people.

No external support could be expected.

Sects like the Thousand Kingdom School, the Martial Sword Troupe, and the Hao Clan refused to assist the alliance because they bore deep grudges against it for the deaths of their leaders.

They knew that once the Jadde Heaven Alliance fell, they would be next. But the world doesn’t always run on logic.

Sometimes, the heart overrules the mind.

The three sects prayed for the Jade Heaven Alliance’s downfall while hoping they would inflict as much damage on the Celestial Demon Troupe as possible before collapsing.

In this dire situation, the Jade Heaven Alliance grew desperate.

They sent envoys to the Seven Great Sects, pleading to forget past grievances and form a new alliance. But none listened.

The envoys were shamefully driven out, and the Thousand Kingdom School even beheaded one and hung his head at their gates in a display of their fury.

With no options left, the Jade Heaven Alliance turned to other sects.

One of them was the Mad Martial Sect, located at the northeastern edge of the Jianghu.

“Is this the Mad Martial Sect?”

A group of martial artists stood at the docks, gazing at the Mad Martial Sect.

Among them was an elderly martial artist in his late sixties, accompanied by over twenty followers.

The old martial artist’s face was emaciated.

He was tired from the long journey, but more so from the chronic condition that had plagued him for years.

His name was Geum Guho.

Once known as the “Hundred-Faced Fox” for his cunning and organizational prowess, he had risen to the position of Outer Hall Master in the Changcheon [c] Alliance.

Over a decade ago, during the war between the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Celestial Demon Troupe, he had suffered grave injuries and was forced into retirement. Yet, even in seclusion, he wielded immense influence.

After he retired, the position of Outer Hall Master remained vacant, with many contenders competing for it. But none succeeded.

Geum Gu-ho had returned.

For the Jade Heaven Alliance, it was a desperate move.

Though he was aged and weakened, Geum Gu-ho was a martial artist who had once dominated his era. He understood the Outer Hall better than anyone and had the ability to command it effectively.

Thus, he was reinstated to oversee the Outer Hall and now visited the Mad Martial Sect as an envoy.

For the Jade Heaven Alliance, it was their last resort.

All Seven Great Sects had refused their pleas, and even the newly re-opened Wudang Sect hesitated to intervene. The only sect of comparable standing in this situation was the Mad Martial Sect.

Especially since its leader, Lee Gwak, was the only martial artist who could rival Ja Hong-cheon.

The Jade Heaven Alliance needed to drag Lee Gwak and the Mad Martial Sect into the war at all costs. With their support, the alliance might find some breathing room amid the relentless pressure.

Geum Gu-ho had come with this critical mission. His followers wore resolute expressions, knowing the weight of the mission.

“Hah…”

Geum Gu-ho sighed involuntarily.

They were determined to succeed at all costs. With their support, the alliance might find some breathing room amid the relentless pressure.

Geum Gu-ho had come with this critical mission. Knowing its weight, his followers wore resolute expressions.

“Hah…”

Geum Gu-ho sighed involuntarily. [d]

It saddened him that the head of the Outer Hall had to personally come here.

Lee Gwak had once been a lowly member of the Outer Hall’s lowest branch.

Not that he looked down on him now. It was just regrettable that they had failed to recognize his worth back then, which led to this predicament.

Geum Gu-ho shook his head.

Now wasn’t the time for personal regrets.

He led his followers toward the Mad Martial Sect.

At the entrance to the Sect, there were already people who had heard the news.

She greeted Geum Gu-ho first.

“It’s been a while.”

“Haha! Indeed, Sobo. Or rather, I should call you Strategist Lim now.”

“You can speak freely.”

“But this is an official visit. I can’t be too casual.”

Geum Gu-ho shook his head.

Lim So-bo looked at him with pity.

She had a deep personal connection with Geum Gu-ho, the Outer Hall Master. Given her status, she had often met him alongside her master, Yeo Jung-wol.

Geum Gu-ho clasped his fists respectfully.

“Geum Gu-ho, the Outer Hall Master of the Jade Heaven Alliance, greets Strategist Lim of the Mad Martial Sect. I have a personal letter from Alliance Leader Ja Hong-cheon for you. I request an audience with Sect Leader Lee to deliver it.”

“A personal letter from the Alliance Leader?”

“Yes.”

Lim So-bo couldn’t hide her surprise. His answer defied her expectations.

She never imagined that the mighty Jade Heaven Alliance, let alone its leader, would send a personal plea for help to Lee Gwak.

“I wish to deliver the letter to Sect Leader Lee in person”

“I can’t decide that on my own. I’ll inform the sect leader.”

“Thank you.”

“But don’t expect a favorable outcome.”

“Haha! I know. Honestly, I don’t have high hopes.”

Geum Gu-ho laughed heartily, but his face was bitter.

Lim So-bo instructed her subordinates to escort Geum Gu-ho’s group to the guest hall while she headed to Lee Gwak’s quarters.

Left alone in the guest hall, Geum Gu-ho quietly surveyed his surroundings.

The high walls prevented a full view, but the grand scale of the guest hall and the rooftops rising beyond the walls hinted at its grandeur.

“Impressive. To grow so much in such a short time.”

The Mad Martial Sect’s history spanned only a few years.

Yet in that brief time, it had grown to rival the great sects of the Jianghu.

If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn’t have believed it.

Few sects in history had expanded this rapidly, the early Jade Heaven Alliance being one of them.

The more he saw, the more he regretted it.

Losing Lee Gwak was bad enough, but Lim So-bo’s departure was also a huge blow.

Had they still been part of the Jade Heaven Alliance, they wouldn’t be in this dire situation now.

“Sigh…”

He exhaled without realizing it, his chest feeling heavy.

Why did the Alliance Leader make that choice…?

For once, he resented Ja Hong-cheon, whose ambition had turned the entire martial world against them. But as a subordinate, resenting his leader was disloyal, so Geum Gu-ho suppressed his anger.

Then, he overheard his men muttering.

‘The alliance is in trouble.’

One of the earliest signs of a sect’s downfall was envy and jealousy.

No sect filled with such emotions ever lasted long.

But Geum Gu-ho had no intention of blaming them.

Though he didn’t show it, he, too, felt a deep sense of inferiority toward Lee Gwak.

“Hah… How pathetic, Geum Gu-ho.”

His quiet sigh echoed through the guest hall.

Dragon Heaven Valley?

Celestial Demon Troupe?

Jade Heaven?
