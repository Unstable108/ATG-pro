The day of the Wudang Sect’s opening ceremony finally arrived.

As it marked the sect’s return to the Jianghu after a hundred years, people’s expectations were naturally high.

The opening ceremony was scheduled to last three full days.

On the first two days, the sect would open its mountain gates to receive guests and display its might, while on the final day, they would hold a heavenly ritual to declare their return to the Jianghu.

The amount of money Wudang had poured into the event was staggering. Every renowned chef from the surrounding region had been summoned, along with hundreds of assistants and laborers hired to manage the workload.

Top-tier ingredients, rarely seen in the market, were transported in massive carriages into the Sect. The number of cows and pigs slaughtered for the event exceeded hundreds, to the point where rumors spread that nearby regions had run out of livestock.

Normally, bringing meat into a Taoist temple was strictly forbidden. But given the occasion, the Wudang Sect made a rare exception.

Though the mountain gates were wide open, not just anyone could enter.

No matter how vast the Wudang sect was, there was a limit to how many people it could accommodate.

Formally invited guests were given priority, and those without invitations were admitted based on their status or renown within the martial world.

“Please, let us in too!”

“How come they’re allowed in but not us?”

“Hey! We got here first!”

The crowd in front of the Sword Dispensing Pool resembled a chaotic scene.

Wudang had stationed elite disciples around the pond to strictly screen the guests.

Many had traveled from far away, only to be turned back at the gates, their frustration reached the skies—but Wudang’s disciples remained unfazed.

They had endured over a hundred years for this moment. They were not so weak-willed as to be swayed by the petty complaints of those who hadn’t been invited.

This level of resentment was inconsequential.

After all, those who couldn’t even pass the mountain gates were third-rate martial artists who held no significant influence in the Jianghu.

It was their duty to firmly turn them away.

Wudang’s First Disciple, Gyeongmyeong, was entrusted with screening guests at the Sword Dispensing Pool.

He stood guard with the second- and third-generation disciples.

The third-generation disciples handled the lesser martial artists, while the second-generation disciples either guided or turned away the more notable ones.

So far, no one significant enough to warrant Gyeongmyeong’s attention had arrived.

The more prestigious the sect, the more they cared about face. They considered it beneath their dignity to arrive early, mingling with lesser martial artists or minor sects.

They would arrive only after the initial chaos had settled. But Gyeongmyeong remained vigilant.

In the Jianghu, anything could happen at any time. Even a moment’s carelessness was unacceptable.

He reviewed the prepared guest list.

‘Dragon Heaven Valley, Thousand Kingdom School…’

These were among the most powerful sects attending the ceremony—sects that rivaled the former Nine Great Sects in reputation.

Wudang was paying particular attention to them.

There were many other sects and martial artists requiring attention as well.

Gyeongmyeong committed their names and notable details to memory.

Just then, a young martial artist pushed through the crowd and approached the Sword Dispensing Pool.

The Taoist disciples paid him little mind. With so many people gathered, it was impossible to focus on every individual.

Despite being turned away, many still lingered, unwilling to leave.

The martial artist made his way through them and approached the Taoist disciples guarding the platform.

A young Taoist in charge of the guest register blocked his path.

“Please stop.”

Only those permitted to sign the guestbook could pass the gates. Others would either leave quietly or end up camping outside in disappointment.

The young Taoist narrowed his eyes and studied the martial artist.

The martial artist was wearing a leather wind breaker.

It was hard to tell how old it was, but the leather was worn and torn. Judging by his appearance, he looked no different from a wandering mercenary of the Jianghu.

His face was plain and unremarkable. But the young taoist didn’t make the mistake of judging a man by his appearance.

He spoke politely.

“Because of the Wudang Sect’s limited capacity, we must verify identities before allowing entry. Please share your name and affiliated sect.”

“I received an invitation.”

“An invitation?”

He turned to Gyeongmyeong.

“Senior Brother, this guest says he received an invitation.”

“Oh?”

Gyeongmyeong approached with the guest list in hand.

He addressed the martial artist respectfully.

“May I see the invitation you received?”

“Here it is.”

The martial artist handed the invitation to Gyeongmyeong without hesitation.

The red envelope was sealed with the personal insignia of Cheongsong, the sect leader of the Wudang Sect

Gyeongmyeong carefully opened the invitation and read it.

For a moment, his pupils trembled.

The name on the invitation was a giant he had never imagined.

“Amitabha… Are you truly the Sura Blade, Lee Gwak?”

“I am.”

Lee Gwak answered calmly.

At that moment, ripples spread through the eyes of Gyeongmyeong and the other Wudang Taoists.

It was the appearance of an unexpected giant.

Gyeongmyeong had assumed that someone of Lee Gwak’s stature would arrive later in the evening or the following day. So his early appearance was a surprise to everyone.

“Who delivered your invitation?”

“It was Taoist Jinghae.”

“If it was Senior Jinghae… then it must be real.”

Gyeongmyeong closed his eyes briefly.

The guest list he held included the names of the invitees and the person who delivered the invitation to prevent anyone from forging a false invitation.

Jinghae, the First Sword of Wudang, had personally delivered invitations to only a handful of people. He only acted for the most important figures.

The fact that Jinghae had personally delivered Lee Gwak’s invitation spoke volumes about his status.

“Did you hear? That’s Sura Blade, Lee Gwak!”

“Is that really him?”

“Wow! This is my first time seeing him!”

The crowd at the Sword Dispensing Pool buzzed with excitement.

Though they had been gathered since dawn, this was the first time someone of Lee Gwak’s caliber had appeared.

“Wooaaah!”

Cheers erupted from the crowd.

To the average martial artist, Lee Gwak was nothing short of an idol.

He started as an outer hall martial artist of the Jade Heaven Alliance and eventually rose to the pinnacle of the Jianghu. His rags-to-riches story was one that any ambitious martial artist would idolize.

In truth, Lee Gwak found the attention overwhelming, but he couldn’t simply turn them away

He offered a respectful martial salute to the crowd.

“It is an honor to meet you all. Thank you.”

“Please, come this way. I’ll escort you personally.”

Gyeongmyeong took his hand and gently guided him away.

The amount of attention Lee Gwak was receiving was clearly overwhelming.

Lee Gwak turned to Gyeongmyeong.

“Don’t I need to surrender my weapon?”

“What? Ah! You mean the Sword Dispensing Platform.”

It was widely known that anyone entering Wudang had to leave their weapons at the pond, regardless of status.

But Gyeongmyeong shook his head.

“Normally, all martial artists must leave their weapons here. But for this occasion, we’ve made an exception.”

“You mean we’re allowed to carry weapons inside?”

“Yes. It would be improper to ask invited guests to surrender their arms.”

To a martial artist, their weapon was as precious as life itself.

While some might willingly surrender theirs, most would never hand their weapons to another, not even to Wudang.

If guests who had been formally invited were asked to disarm, how many would actually enter?

For this ceremony, the Wudang Sect had temporarily lifted the restrictions of the Sword Dispensing Pool.

Because of this, Lee Gwak was able to pass through without surrendering his blade.

As he passed through the mountain gates, the atmosphere shifted dramatically.

The chaotic noises vanished, replaced by the serene ambiance of a secluded Taoist temple.

The path leading up to the Wudang Sect was well-paved.

The flat stone walkway was so smooth that even a three-year-old could easily ascend.

Along the path, unnamed flowers bloomed in vibrant abundance.

Clearly, the Wudang sect had gone to great lengths to organize this opening ceremony.

As they walked together, Gyeongmyeong struck up a conversation.

“Thank you, Hero Lee, for accepting our invitation. Your presence has greatly honored our sect.”

“Since I received an invitation, it was only right to come.”

“Did you encounter any trouble on your way here?”

“Few recognized me, so it was a comfortable trip.”

Gyeongmyeong’s eyes gleamed at Lee Gwak’s reply.

‘He truly is as humble as the rumors say.’

The Wudang Sect had been meticulous in selecting invitation recipients.

Anyone with a bad reputation would not be invited at all. To avoid making even the slightest mistake, they did a thorough background check on the invitees.

The most surprising subject of their investigation had been Lee Gwak.

He was too modest for his reputation.

Most would crave wealth and luxury at that level—but not Lee Gwak.

After eradicating the Heavenly Fate Sect—a heretical group that had plunged the world into chaos—he went on to establish a small, orthodox sect called the Mad Martial Sect.

He could have aimed for the throne of the Jianghu, but instead, he lived quietly as a small sect master. It was baffling to many of the Wudang Sect’s disciples.

For over a hundred years, the Wudang Sect had been struggling to regain its former prestige. In contrast, Lee Gwak, despite his immense reputation, seemed content with his modest standing—a mindset difficult for them to grasp.

Gyeongmyeong had initially suspected Lee Gwak’s humility was calculated. But meeting him in person, he realized it was genuine.

Lee Gwak was genuinely humble.

There was no ulterior motive.

‘He is truly a man worthy of respect.’

A brief shadow crossed Gyeongmyeong’s eyes.

Among the first-generation disciples, he enjoyed special treatment.

Though he wasn’t as brilliant as Jinghae or Gyeong-un, he was still counted among the ten strongest of the first-generation disciples.

He had access to Wudang’s most sensitive information—including matters related to Lee Gwak.

Had Lee Gwak turned out to be a fraud, it would have been easier to deal with.

Sigh…

Gyeongmyeong let out an unconscious sigh.

Lee Gwok turned to him. “Is something bothering you?”

“Oh, no. My nerves are just a bit on edge.”

“Of course! The Wudang Sect’s return after a hundred years must be nerve-wracking.”

“Thank you for understanding. Oh, that’s the Clear Heart Pavilion, where the guests will be staying. It was built in anticipation of the opening ceremony.”

The Clear Heart Pavilion consisted of four main halls:

The Celestial Hero Hall, the Earthly Hero Hall, the Mysterious Hero Hall, and the Golden Hero Hall.

Those who entered without a formal invitation were guided to the Golden Hero Hall, the largest hall.

Since the Golden Hero Hall had no private rooms, guests had to share quarters—anywhere from three to five people sleeping together.

In contrast, those with official invitations were assigned to the Celestial Hero Hall, the Earthly Hero Hall, or the Mysterious Hero Hall.

Accommodations were arranged based on the prestige of their sect, the number of disciples they had trained, and their personal renown.

In particular, the Seven Sects were given large separate annexes to avoid potential conflicts.

“This is where you’ll be staying, Master Lee,”

The room assigned to Lee Gwok was the largest one in Celestial Hero Hall.

Lee Gwak gave a slightly troubled look.

“This… is too big. It feels like a waste of space for just one person.”

“This room was designated for you from the moment the invitations were sent out. The Sect Leader arranged it personally, so we would appreciate it if you didn’t refuse.”

“Understood.”

Lee Gwak agreed reluctantly.

It felt petty to ask for a room change just because it was too spacious, especially when Wudang had gone out of their way to be considerate.

Instead, he asked a question that had been on his mind.

“Are there any special rules I should be aware of while staying here?”

“Rules?”

“Places I shouldn’t go, or curfews, for example.”

“Ah! Aside from the True Immortal Hall, you’re free to go anywhere. As for movement, you’re allowed to come and go until midnight. We’d extend it further if we could, but since that’s when the sect retires for the night, we ask for your understanding. Other than that, you may move about freely.”

“I see.”

“Oh! The dining area is on the first floor of Heavenly Hero Hall. The chefs are on standby all day in shifts, so you can eat whenever you like.”

“Thank you for the detailed explanation.”

“If you need anything, there’s an attendant waiting outside. Just call for him. I’ll take my leave now.”

Gyeongmyeong gave a fist salute to Lee Gwak and exited the room.

Left alone, Lee Gwak walked to the window and opened it. The view of Clear Heart Pavilion spread out before him.

The Celestial Hero Hall, where he was staying, stood at the center, surrounded by the Earthly Hero Hall, Mysterious Hero Hall, and the Golden Hero Hall.

Lee Gwak muttered under his breath.

“It feels like I’m surrounded.”
