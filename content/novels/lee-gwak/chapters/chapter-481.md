The storm of the Celestial Demon Troupe was terrifying.

It wasn’t enough that they destroyed Dragon Heaven Valley; they immediately set their next target on the Thousand Kingdom School.

Celestial Demon Troupe was like a hurricane—

a calamity that no human power could withstand.

Every sect in the martial world trembled before their overwhelming destruction. Not a single sect dared to stand against them.

With Changcheonmaeng annihilated, the martial world had lost its center. No one could unite, and the Celestial Demon Troupe exploited that opening without hesitation.

They knew well they had to strike before the martial world could gather together. Above all, they had Go Geom Wol.

Go Geom Wol led the Celestial Demon Troupe with absolute authority.

Unlike others, he did not push his disciples forward while hiding in safety.

He was always at the front lines.

People called him the Divine Demon of the Nine Realms, and they feared him.

A god-demon ruling the Nine Provinces.

Go Geom Wol became the very embodiment of terror in the Jianghu.

For a hundred years, no figure had struck such fear.

Martial artists trembled at the mere sound of his name, and common folk even considered uttering his name taboo.

And the stronger Celestial Demon Troupe grew under Go Geom-wol’s rule, the more another name rose to prominence.

The Mad Martial Sect.

At the beginning of the war, no one even mentioned them. But because of Lee Gwak, that changed.

No one knew who first said it, but rumors spread across the land that only Lee Gwak could face Go Geom-wol.

The martial world was never at peace for even a day under Celestial Demon Troupe’s rampage. Sleepless with fear, people prayed desperately for the chaos to end and for a savior to appear.

Lee Gwak was the perfect figure for their hopes. Yet, whether knowingly or not, neither Lee Gwak nor Mad Martial Sect made any move.

“Mad Martial Sect…”

Muk Seon-wol gazed at the Black River flowing steadily and murmured to herself.

Her face had grown gaunt to the point of being pitiable. After the collapse of Dragon Heaven Valley, it had taken her a full month to reach the vicinity of the Black River near the Mad Martial Sect.

Initially, Yang So-cheon led the group, but later, having regained her strength, she took the lead.

Along the way, martial artists who had individually escaped the Dragon Heaven Valley joined them, increasing their number to five hundred.

Moving such a large group was never easy. Yet she managed to bring them all here without losing a single soul.

The month-long journey left her body and spirit exhausted. She was so weak it wouldn’t have been strange if she collapsed at any moment.

But she kept going, driven by the responsibility of ensuring her people reached Mad Martial Sect safely. Now, at last, she was at the end of her mission.

“There?”

Someone among the Dragon Heaven Valley martial artists pointed toward the river. From that direction, several ships were cutting through the current.

At the bow of the lead ship stood a man she knew well.

The moment she saw him, her breath caught in her throat.

“Master.. Lee!”

It was none other than Lee Gwak, the lord of Mad Martial Sect. He could have sent subordinates, but instead, he had come personally.

Behind him stood Seok Yi-cheon and Lim Sobo.

Boom!

As soon as the ship docked, they leapt ashore.

“Miss Mok!”

Lee Gwak approached her with a grave expression.

“Master Lee! How did you know?”

“I received word from the Hao Clan. My condolences, Miss Mok.”

“Thank you, Master Lee, for your concern. Here and now, I must make a difficult request. Until Celestial Demon Troupe is defeated, may I and the warriors of Dragon Heaven Valley take shelter in the Mad Martial Sect? Is it possible?”

“Of course. Consider this your home. Lodgings for you all have already been prepared.”

“…Thank you.”

Biting her lip, she bowed her head. His consideration nearly brought her to tears.

Lee Gwak looked at her with pity.

From the day he learned of Dragon Heaven Valley’s fall, he had mobilized all of Hao Clan’s and Mad Martial Sect’s intelligence to track her movements.

Im Sobo pieced together the information and became certain that Muk Seon-wol and her warriors were heading for the Mad Martial Sect.

On her orders, shelters were prepared within the Mad Martial Sect, and they had been completed only yesterday.

Boom! Boom!

Ships carrying Dragon Heaven Valley survivors docked one after another. Gangplanks were lowered, ready for boarding.

Lee Gwak spoke, “Please, board.”

“Thank you, Yi Daehyeop!”

Mok Seon-wol clasped her fists in salute and stepped onto the ship, followed by the warriors.

Just then, a girl approached Lee Gwak.

“Mister!”

The girl calling Lee Gwak in a small voice was Yang Hye-so, granddaughter of the Moon Shadow True Demon, Yang Su-cheon.

Lee Gwak forced a smile.

“You’re safe. Welcome.”

“I’m glad to see you like this.”

“You’ve been through a lot.”

Lee Gwak reached out and stroked Yang Hye-so’s head.

Yang Hye-so silently felt his touch.

She was too tired from the long journey to even speak, but strangely, Lee Gwak’s stroking made her feel relieved.

Then, an old man behind Yang Hye-so approached.

“Hoo! I didn’t expect to see you again like this.”

It was Yang Su-cheon.

“You’ve been through a lot on the long journey, Sect Leader [a] Yang!”

“Me? I’ve been through everything, I’m used to it, it wasn’t hard at all. It’s this child who suffered on the long journey.”

Yang Su-cheon said with a dark expression, stroking Yang Hye-so’s back.

All he wanted was for Yang Hye-so to live happily. That’s why he had joined Yongcheon Valley, and he felt sorry that losing their home like this had made her suffer again.

Lee Gwak took Yang Hye-so’s hand and spoke.

“Let’s go, Hye-so. Soo-ah has been waiting for you to come for days now.”

“Really?”

Yang Hye-so’s eyes sparkled.

She had heard Lee Gwak had a daughter her age. Having grown up with no friends, the thought of meeting someone like her filled her with joy.

“Is Soo-ah really waiting for me?”

“Of course. She’s been restless, preparing to meet you.”

“I want to see her right away!”

“Then let’s board quickly. You’ll meet her as soon as we reach Mad Martial Sect.”

“Yes!”

Brightening, Hye-so climbed aboard.

Yang So-cheon followed behind, bowing slightly to Lee Gwak.

“Thank you… for looking after her.”

“It’s nothing.”

“I will repay this debt someday.”

With that, he boarded as well.

Finally, Lee Gwak stepped aboard, and the ships departed.

The four ships carried five hundred warriors upstream, soon reaching the Mad Martial Sect.

At the dock, the Mad Martial Sect’s leadership and warriors awaited them.

Boom!

As soon as the vessels touched shore, Seok Yi-cheon gave orders.

“Quickly, guide them to their quarters.”

“Yes, sir!”

the Mad Martial Sect’s warriors bustled about, leading the survivors to the lodgings prepared for them.

Warm food awaited them.

Seok Icheon addressed the Dragon Heaven Valley warriors:

“There is plenty of food. Eat your fill. If you need more, say so—we’ll bring more without limit.”

By now, he truly bore the air of a chief steward.

Under his direction, the Mad Martial Sect’s warriors moved with perfect discipline, allowing the survivors to rest at ease.

“Thank you. We will never forget this kindness.”

“We’re grateful.”

The Dragon Heaven Valley martial artists bowed in gratitude.

Among the Mad Martial Sect’s people were many who had also lost their homes, so they empathized deeply and treated the newcomers warmly.

Han So-cheon personally guided Mok Seon-wol to her quarters, mindful of how exhausted she must be after such a long journey.

Yang Hye-so blinked her large eyes, nervous at the unfamiliar surroundings.

Then, a girl her own age approached and boldly grasped both her hands.

“Nice to meet you! You’re Hye-so, right? I’m Soo-ah—Lee Soo-ah!”

“Ah!”

“My dad told me you were coming. Let’s be friends.”

“…Okay!”

Startled by Soo-ah’s unreserved friendliness, Hye-so blinked a few times, then nodded.

The two girls, as if they were old friends, immediately walked away hand in hand. The cheerful, chattering voices of the two girls, like a pair of song birds, helped ease the fatigue of the martial artists weary from their long journey.

Lee Gwak stood in place, watching the people.

Just then, Lim So-bo approached him and said,

“It won’t be long now. The day we clash with the Celestial Demon Troupe is coming.”

Lee Gwak nodded his head silently.

[a] Supposed to be elder, no?
