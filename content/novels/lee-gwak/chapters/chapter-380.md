Bang Ju-gwang handed a teacup to Lee Gwak and his group.

“Drink Up, you must be thirsty.”

“Thank you.”

Lee Gwak accepted the teacup.

Cheon Wol and Seok Yi-cheon also picked up their teacups beside Lee Gwak.

The tea was clean and refreshing. The dryness in their mouths faded, replaced by a cool sensation.

“This is good.”

“It’s a tea I enjoy regularly. Not all famous teas satisfy a person’s palate, you see.”

Lee Gwak nodded in agreement with Bang Ju-gwang’s opinion.

As Bang Ju-gwang set down his teacup, he asked,

“So! How did you end up here?”

“Your daughter invited me. She said there was an important gathering here and asked me to attend.”

“Hah, it seems my daughter holds you in high regard. She doesn’t bring just anyone. Moreover, outsiders are strictly forbidden from attending this gathering.”

Bang Ju-gwang looked at Lee Gwak with deep eyes. The gaze of a master who’d dedicated his entire life to one craft was fathomless.

Lee Gwak did not avoid his gaze and asked,

“May I ask if something happened here?”

“There was a big fight. Thankfully, they had enough conscience to restrain themselves from damaging the inn. Still, some parts were damaged.”

“Who fought?”

“The Lord of Sky High Castle and Wudang’s First Sword.”

“What?”

“The master of Cheongo Fortress and Wudang’s First Sword clashed. Right in my front yard… Tsk!”

Bang Ju-gwang clicked his tongue.

Seok Yi-cheon’s mind went blank at the sheer enormity of the statement delivered so casually.

‘Wudang’s First Sword? So, the greatest master of Wudang? But Wudang had closed its gates. Does this mean they’ve reopened and sent out their elite?’

His usually sharp mind felt sluggish.

Cheon Wol asked,

“You mean Lord Po fought Wudang’s First Sword? What was the outcome?”

Given that Lim So-bo was currently under Sky High Castle’s protection, it was only natural for him to be concerned.

Bang Ju-gwang exhaled deeply.

“As always, the old waves are pushed by the new, but it’s still unsettling to see.”

Cheon-wol and Lee Gwak were equally shocked.

Lee Gwak hastily asked,

“So… the lord of Sky High Castle was defeated?”

“That’s right. It was a close call, but the lord of Sky High Castle lost.”

“That’s hard to believe.”

“I felt the same. But I saw it with my own eyes, so there’s no denying it.”

“Where are the two of them now?”

“Lord Po left in anger, and Wudang’s First Sword disappeared somewhere with the leader of Myriad Merchant Troupe.”

“Hmm.”

“Sigh… Namgung, the Thousand Kingdom School’s leader, followed them, but I don’t know how that turned out.”

Bang Ju-gwang let out another heavy sigh.

Cheon Wol turned to Lee Gwak.

“Brother, I think I should head to Sky High Castle first.”

“Already?”

“So-bo is there. I have to tell her about Master Yeo’s death, and most of all, I’m worried about Lord Po’s defeat.”

“I understand. There’s no helping it.”

Though Lee Gwak wanted to keep him longer, the situation left no room for delay.

“Go ahead.”

“Thank you.”

“I’ll visit Sky High Castle soon, so let So-bo know.”

“Yes!”

After bidding farewell to Seok Yi-cheon, Cheon Wol immediately left.

“Sigh… I don’t know what’s happening anymore.”

Seok Yi-cheon shook his head in disbelief.

Glug, glug.

Bang Ju-gwang refilled the empty teacups and spoke,

“Wudang’s First Sword, and now you. My eyes are truly feasting today.”

“How did you know he was Wudang’s First Sword?”

“After defeating Lord Po, he declared it himself. He said no one in Wudang could rival him, so there was no shame in losing.”

“Hmm.”

“I suppose he meant it as consolation, but for Lord Po, it must have been unbearable humiliation. The atmosphere was ruined, and the gathering fell apart. In a hundred years, nothing like this has ever happened.”

Bang Ju-gwang lamented the break in tradition.

He had always known it would happen someday, but the fact that it occurred during his time pained him.

“What is Wudang’s First Sword’s name?”

“Jinghae. He’s probably around your age.”

“Jinghae…”

Lee Gwak rolled the name in his mind.

Wudang reopening its gates and sending out martial artists was not unusual—Mount Hua’s Ja Seol-gyeong had also been secretly active.

The problem was the timing.

Why had Wudang chosen now, at the peak of chaos, to reopen?

‘If Wudang has opened its gates, what about the other four great sects…?’

Lee Gwak’s gaze darkened.

To his knowledge, only five of the original nine great sects remained: Shaolin, Wudang, Mount Hua, Qingcheng, and Emei.

The others had either perished in the Great Heavenly War a century ago or declined to the point of oblivion.

Now, they were called the Five Great Sects, not nine.

Mount Hua had already begun moving, and now Wudang was stretching its limbs. The remaining sects would surely follow.

Bang Ju-gwang shook his head.

“The war between the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Seven Sects isn’t even over, and now the Five Great Sects are emerging. The Jianghu hasn’t been this chaotic since the Great Heavenly Blood War.”

“It seems you believe all five sects will return.”

“Everything has its flow. The Five Great Sects are bound together. After centuries of shared history, if one moves, the others will follow. It’s only natural.”

“Hmm.”

“The question is their intent. Why now?”

Bang Ju-gwang’s expression darkened.

Though he lived detached from the Jianghu, extreme chaos would inevitably affect his life.

With just a word from Bang Ju-gwang, he could summon leaders of major sects like the Thousand Kingdom School Guild or Sky High Castle. But he wanted nothing more than to remain a simple innkeeper for the rest of his days.

“Common, Cheer up. Anyone seeing you would think the world is ending.”

Just then, Bang Ye-in came out carrying a tray and scolded Bang Ju-gwang.

“Tch! The way this girl talks… I worry who will take you in.”

“Why worry about that?”

Bang Ye-in snorted, and Bang Ju-gwang’s face twisted oddly.

His gaze at Cheol Gwang-woo seemed to say, ‘Your fate is harsh.’

Cheol Gwang-woo turned away from Bang Joo-gwang’s gaze, scratching his head.

Lee Gwak chuckled, but his face remained expressionless.

‘Jinghae…’

His mouth felt gritty, as if he had chewed on sand.

Lee Gwak woke up early in the morning and quietly stepped outside.

The dawn sky was just beginning to lighten.

The plum blossoms, tinted red by the morning light, and the river’s scenery were breathtakingly beautiful. Lee Gwak stood still, dazedly taking in the sight.

Motionless as a statue, his eyes suddenly caught on a fishing rod leaning to one side.

It was a crude rod, hastily made from bamboo.

Lee Gwak had no interest in fishing and had never tried it before. Yet, today, the rod inexplicably drew his attention.

He picked it up.

Strangely, it fit perfectly in his hand. After flexing his grip a few times, Lee Gwak headed toward the river in front of the inn.

He settled at a suitable spot along the bank.

“Bait…”

Only then did Lee Gwak realize he hadn’t brought any.

For a moment, he considered going back to ask Bang Ju-gwang for some but quickly shook his head.

While he was curious about the rod, he had no real interest in fishing itself.

There was no need to go through the hassle.

Swish!

Lee Gwak cast the bare hook into the river.

Without bait, there was no way a fish would bite.

Not that Lee Gwak expected one anyway.

He had simply cast the line because the rod caught his eye, and he wanted to clear his cluttered thoughts while watching the flowing water.

Lee Gwak stared blankly at the river.

While wandering through the Jianghu, Lee Gwak had crossed many rivers, but this was the first time he had simply stared at one without any particular thoughts.

Lee Gwak lost track of time, sitting motionless by the river, staring at the water.

“Ahem!”

It was someone’s soft cough that finally broke his reverie. He turned to see Seok Yi-cheon looking at him.

“Fishing this early?”

“Just felt like it.”

“Catch anything?”

Lee Gwak shook his head.

Seok Yi-cheon sat beside him and asked again,

“Bait?”

“Didn’t use any.”

“What? Then why fish?”

Seok Yi-cheon grumbled, his face a picture of disbelief. To him, this defied all logic.

Unfazed, Lee Gwak replied,

“I wasn’t really trying to catch anything.”

“Still, that’s no way to fish. Give it here.”

Seok Yi-cheon took the rod.

Since Lee Gwak had no attachment to it, he handed it over without protest.

“Huh?”

As Seok Yi-cheon tugged the line, his eyes widened at an unexpected weight.

“What’s wrong?”

“No way…”

Seok Yi-cheon yanked the rod with all his might.

Instantly, the bamboo rod bent like a bow.

“Did it actually catch something? That’s impossible!”

Seok Yi Cheon was in disbelief. But the heavy feeling in his hand told him that it was indeed a fish.

Careful not to break the line, Seok Yi-cheon reeled it in.

Soon, a large fish broke the surface, thrashing wildly but in vain. Seok Yi-cheon effortlessly pulled it ashore.

The fish, as thick as a man’s forearm, had bitten the bare hook.

Staring at the hook and the fish in turn, Seok Yi-cheon let out a hollow laugh and looked at Lee Gwak.

“Hah! I guess talent shows in everything.”

“It actually worked.”

“This is ridiculous…”

Grumbling, Seok Yi-cheon removed the hook from the fish’s mouth.

After staring at the hook and the fish for a moment, he threw the catch into a small basket he had brought with him.

He had brought it on a whim, never imagining it would hold a fish caught on a bare hook.

Suddenly, Seok Yi-cheon dug into the soft riverbank soil, uncovering an earthworm.

“Ah, you!”

He skewered the worm onto the hook.

The earthworm writhed in pain, but Seok Yi-cheon paid no mind and cast the line back into the river.

“With bait, I’ll definitely catch something bigger.”

He muttered confidently.

Lee Gwak smiled, watching Seok Yi-cheon’s profile.

Although Cheon Wol’s sudden departure was unexpected, having Seok Yi-cheon by his side kept loneliness at bay.

“Brother.”

“Hmm?”

“Nothing.”

“How dull…”

Seok Yi-cheon chuckled.

Lee Gwak smiled too and turned his gaze back to the river.

A cold wind blew.

Winter was approaching. Seok Yi-cheon tightened his collar against the chill.

“Winter’s really coming. The first snow will fall before this month ends.”

Fallen leaves already carpeted the ground.

Though some still clung to the trees, they would soon join the rest.

Suddenly, Seok Yi-cheon looked at Lee Gwak.

“At least people won’t fight in winter, right?”

“Hard to say.”

“I really hope they don’t. It’s always the lower ranks and commoners who suffer.”

Having risen from the lower ranks himself, Seok Yi-cheon knew their hardships all too well.

Winter wars meant death for low-level martial artists. Even if they had proper clothing, frostbite was common.

Some lost limbs to gangrene.

Having seen too much of this, Seok Yi-cheon dreaded winter.

Lee Gwak couldn’t answer easily.

With just the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Seven Sects at war, predictions might have been possible. But now, the Five Great Sects had entered the conflict.

Their movements would reshape the conflict.

One thing was certain: everything hinged on how this winter unfolded.

“Sigh… This winter will be especially long.”

Just as Lee Gwak sighed—

“Damn it! How does someone catch fish with a bare hook while I get nothing? Is this fair?”

Seok Yi-cheon’s frustrated shout echoed along the riverbank.
