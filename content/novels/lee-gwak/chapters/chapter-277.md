Namgung Jin barely regained his senses after taking the antidote.

“Are you alright, brother?”

“Yeon-hwa! How did you…?”

Namgung Jin recognized Namgung Yeon-hwa’s face.

At first, he thought he was hallucinating from the poison, but the warmth emanating from her proved otherwise.

“You survived.”

“We’ll talk about it later. First, we need to get out of here.”

At that moment, he saw the martial artists of Dark Moon Pavilion and Blood Martial Squad charging toward Lee Gwak.

“What the…?”

Namgung Jin, unaware of the situation, widened his eyes.

“Who is that man?”

“Who is that man?”

“He’s Master Lee Gwak.”

“Lee Gwak?”

“The Sura blade, Lee Gwak! He saved me.”

Namgung Jin’s gaze fixated on Lee Gwak’s back.

Asura Lee Gwak.

He had heard that name before.

When Namgung Jin was making a name for himself as one of the Ten Lesser skies, Lee Gwak had established his own realm, surpassing their fame.

Because of that, Namgung Jin had once been curious about Lee Gwak and investigated him. He knew that Lee Gwak’s martial prowess was extraordinary. But he didn’t think he could handle all those opponents alone.

“No way! Even he can’t take them all by himself…”

Despite the swarm of enemies approaching, Lee Gwak hadn’t yet drawn his blade.

He seemed like a man desperate to die—or perhaps he had already given up in fear.

At that moment, Namgung Yeon-hwa shook her head.

“Brother! He’s different.”

“What?”

“He is…”

Just then.

Boom!

Then, it happened.

Clang!

With the sound of air shattering, a tremendous shockwave swept through the area.

The impact was so intense that Namgung Jin and Namgung Yeon-hwa instinctively covered their ears, and the already weakened walls crumbled under the strain.

“What is…?”

“What…?”

Namgung Jin’s eyes widened at the unbelievable sight before him.

About twenty martial artists at the forefront were being blown back as if struck by a giant club.

At some point, Lee Gwak had drawn his blade.

With a single strike, he had rendered around twenty martial artists powerless.

Namgung Jin could only stare at Lee Gwak’s back.

Lee Gwak was already in the midst of the martial artists. He had thrust himself right into the heart of their formation.

Swish!

Lee Gwak’s blade sliced through the air.

“Ugh!”

One of the Blood Martial Squad’s martial artist fell, blood spraying. A long gash had appeared on his chest, carved by Lee Gwak’s blade.

It was a simple yet forceful technique.

Lee Cheong watched in awe.

“Mountain Splitting Slash?”

Others may not have recognized it, but Lee Cheong, who had learned martial arts directly from Lee Gwak, recognized the technique.

It was the first form of the Eight Sects Sword Art, Mountain Splitting Slash.

He followed it up with Raging Tidal Force.

“Argh!”

“Ugh!”

In an instant, several martial artists were rendered incapacitated.

Lee Gwak’s blade drew a graceful curve before shooting out like lightning.

Boom!

A powerful strike resounded with an explosive sound.

It was the third move of the Eight Sects Sword Art: Shadowless Strike

Since mastering the Heaven Killing Blade, Lee Gwak hadn’t used the Eight Sects Sword Art. All its essence was contained within the Heaven Killing Sword, so there was no need to use it.

The reason he was now displaying the Eight Sects Sword Art was for Lee Cheong.

Having just begun learning the technique, Lee Cheong’s perspective was limited. The best way to broaden his view was to show him a wider world—to directly demonstrate the immense power of the Eight Sects Sword Art he was learning.

Blood Dragon’s Roar

Lone Scorch Demon.

Shadowy Assassinate

Heavens Shattering Iron Blood.

Eight Gateways of Destruction.,

The remaining five moves of the Eight Sects Sword Art unfolded seamlessly like unwinding threads.

Swish, swish, swish!

The air was filled with the afterimages of Lee Gwak’s blade.

“Damn it!”

“Dodge, dodge!”

“Argh!”

Screams and wails filled the place.

No one could withstand even a single strike from Lee Gwak.

His bladesmanship was concise.

Lee Gwak’s blade technique was straightforward—cuts and slashes that maximized the essence of the blade’s function. Any trained martial artist could recognize the simple forms.

Yet, no one could withstand those simple moves.

Lee Cheong trembled.

His small fists clenched tightly.

He had seen Lee Gwak display martial arts several times before.

When they broke through the Heaven and Earth net of the White Light Sect, and when they clashed with the Green Heaven Society on the way here, Lee Gwak had used martial arts.

But back then, he felt nothing special.

To him, his father was simply a strong man; such displays of strength were expected.

The gap between him and Lee Gwak was so vast that he couldn’t grasp the true essence of strength. But now that he saw Lee Gwak demonstrate the Eight Sects Sword Art, he began to understand.

Ten thousand practices, a hundred thousand refinements.

Repeating simple movements ten thousand, a hundred thousand times to engrave them into the body.

So that it could be executed flawlessly, no matter the circumstances.

Lee Gwak was embodying that simple truth.

Lee Cheong was captivated, watching Lee Gwak’s movements with rapt attention. Lee Gwak was showing him the path he needed to follow.

One blade, one cut.

With each stroke of Lee Gwak’s blade, someone inevitably fell.

“This…this is insane!”

Go Jeon-ok trembled, his lips quivering at Lee Gwak’s incredible martial prowess.

Until now, he had belittled Lee Gwak, thinking of him as someone he could use at any time. But witnessing Lee Gwak’s martial prowess firsthand, it far surpassed his imagination.

“Ugh!”

The elite martial artist Go Jeon-ok had paid a fortune to recruit couldn’t withstand a single blow from Lee Gwak and lost his arm.

“Argh!”

A martial artist who had reigned like a king in the distant southern regions lost a leg and rolled on the ground. He was also someone Go Jeon-ok had painstakingly recruited.

He screamed desperately, forgetting all dignity.

There were many martial artists like him.

Lee Gwak’s sword was now stained red with their blood.

“Ugh!”

“How can this be!”

Fear spread across the faces of Dark Moon Pavilion’s martial artists.

Despite outnumbering those who had fallen, terror shone in their eyes.

Their spirits were utterly crushed.

They were Go Jeon-ok’s shield.

The barrier that protected the master of Dark Moon Pavilion and the sword that slaughtered his enemies.

Only Go Jeon-ok knew how proud he had been when he completed Dark Moon Pavilion’s forces.

It felt as if he had gained the whole world.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say he had endured all humiliations for this day.

But his pride, everything he had built, was crumbling helplessly before Lee Gwak.

The martial artists of the Dark Moon Pavilion had already lost their will to fight.

They charged at Lee Gwak, screaming, but there was no fighting spirit on their faces.

Such was the limit of martial artists recruited with money.

In contrast, the martial artists of the Blood Martial Squad attacked Lee Gwak with relentless tenacity.

Although they had lost their leader, Seop Yeol, to Namgung Jin, they had pride as martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance. They had accomplished numerous missions that bordered on the impossible.

Those experiences were the source of the Blood Martial Squads’ strength.

“Do you think we’ll retreat?”

“We’ll cling on till the end.”

The eyes of the Blood Martial Squad martial artists were filled with such fierce determination that even onlookers felt a chill.

Slash!

They tenaciously clung to Lee Gwak.

An ordinary martial artist might have been overwhelmed by their ferocity and fallen back long ago. But Lee Gwak was no ordinary martial artist.

He was even more tenacious, with greater endurance and an ironclad will.

Shing!

“Ugh!”

A martial artist from the Blood Martial Squad lost his life helplessly to a single strike from Lee Gwak.

His resentful gaze pierced Lee Gwak’s heart like a dagger.

Lee Gwak bit his lip hard.

Fighting against the warriors of the Jade Heaven Alliance didn’t sit well with him.

It was the place where he had spent his youth.

At one time, he had thought the Jade Heaven Alliance was his entire world and had expected to spend his life there.

Although he had now become independent, he still harbored feelings for the alliance.

He was now using lethal moves against its martial artists.

They were people with whom he had once shared meals.

He disliked having to wield lethal force against them. But there was no turning back now.

It was a decision he had already made.

With a determined expression, Lee Gwak continued forward.

In front of him was Go Jeon-ok.

Step by step, Lee Gwak approached Go Jeon-ok, whose face turned pale.

“Lee Gwak!”

Go Jeon-ok’s shoulder trembled uncontrollably.

He, too, was a martial artist who had learned martial arts.

Having passed through the Celestial Palace, he had learned secret techniques that ordinary martial artists couldn’t even dream of. After becoming a close aide to Yong Cheon-myeong, he had been given manuals containing supreme martial arts.

Goh Jeon-ok had mastered all those techniques. Although he couldn’t claim to have reached great mastery, he had learned them to a respectable level. But witnessing Lee Gwak’s overwhelming prowess, his confidence melted away like snow.

Lee Gwak’s martial arts skills were at a level he couldn’t hope to match.

It was an entirely different dimension.

“If he’s this strong, he could even rival the Alliance Leader… No, that can’t be. The Alliance Leader is…”

Go Jeon-ok shook his head, horrified by his own fleeting thought.

No matter how blinded he was by ambition and saw people as mere tools, the Lord of the Jade Heaven Alliance, Ja Hong-cheon, was different.

To Go Jeon-ok, Ja Hong-cheon was akin to a god.

A god who ruled the Jianghu.

The very thought of comparing Lee Gwak to the Alliance Leader was blasphemy.

He tried to dismiss Lee Gwak’s presence, but the more he tried, the more imposing Lee Gwak became.

With the final scream from the last Blood Martial Squad’s martial artist who had resisted to the end, silence fell.

All the Blood Martial Squads martial artists had fallen.

Though a significant number of Dark Moon Pavilion martial artists remained unscathed, none dared to stand in Lee Gwak’s way. Instead, they retreated, hesitating with every step.

Lee Gwak walked steadily through their ranks.

Some might have considered a surprise attack, but no one dared to make such a foolish choice.

“Ugh!”

A suppressed groan escaped someone’s lips, conveying the raw emotion they were all feeling.

Lee Gwak walked on, not sparing them a single glance.

“G-Gwak!”

As Lee Gwak approached within arm’s reach, Go Jeon-ok urgently called out.

Like the Dark Moon Pavilion martial artists, his face was a mask of fear.

“Don’t do this, Gwak! We’re friends, aren’t we?”

“Friends…”

“Yes! Childhood friends. Remember? We’ve been together since we were young. There’s no need for this over a small misunderstanding.”

Go Jeon-ok raised both hands as if to confirm he wasn’t holding any weapons. Then he cautiously approached Lee Gwak.

“Gwak! I was wrong. Please forgive me.”

“Jeon-ok!”

“It’s entirely my fault. I’ll accept any punishment, so let’s reconcile here. I’ll compensate for all the damages from the fire. If I can’t, I’ll mobilize all the power of the Jade Heaven Alliance to restore everything to its original state, so please forgive me. Okay? We’re friends.”

Tears seemed ready to spill from Go Jeon-ok’s eyes at any moment.

It was an expression that would inevitably weaken anyone’s resolve.

“Sigh!”

Lee Gwak let out a low sigh.

Encouraged by this, Go Jeon-ok mustered more courage and approached closer.

“You’ll forgive me, right?”

At that moment, a transparent sword, clear as glass, slipped out from Goh Jeon-ok’s sleeve.

The Glass Demon Sword.

It was a weapon boasting such transparency that it was nearly invisible to the naked eye.

It was given to him by Yong Cheon-myeong when he became his trusted confidant. Its blade was so sharp it could slice through the hardest steel in one stroke.

Realizing he couldn’t take Lee Gwak on with martial arts alone, Go Jeon-ok had prepared this hidden weapon as his last resort.

They were close enough to feel each other’s breaths. To Go Jeon-ok, Lee Gwak appeared completely defenseless.

Feigning an embrace, Go Jeon-ok drove the Glass Demon Sword toward Lee Gwak’s side.

Thunk!

A chilling sound echoed.

A victorious smile crossed Go Jeon-ok’s lips. But only for a moment; his face soon contorted.

A fiery pain erupted in his abdomen.

Go Jeon-ok looked down at his abdomen. Lee Gwak’s blade was embedded there. Meanwhile, his Glass Demon Sword had missed Lee Gwak’s side.

“Argh!”

Goh Jeon-ok collapsed, vomiting blood onto Lee Gwak’s chest.

“Jeon-ok!”

Lee Gwak caught the collapsing Go Jeon-ok in his arms.
