A cold wind blew in, dispersing the aroma of liquor that had filled the room. The scent of alcohol lingered on Lee Gwak’s breath as well.

He had spent the night drinking with Seok Yi Cheon, losing count of the number of jars they had emptied.

They drank to their heart’s content and talked all through the night.

It was the first time since leaving the Jianghu that Lee Gwak had indulged in such heavy drinking.

Though still a bit hungover, it wasn’t too uncomfortable for him.

A bit of internal energy work could easily dispel such minor effects of alcohol, but Lee Gwak chose not to do so.

He stared blankly outside for a moment.

He wasn’t thinking about anything, simply enjoying his vacant time.

Someone approached Lee Gwak’s door, the sound of their dress sweeping the floor.

Turning his head, Lee Gwak saw a young courtesan approaching with a tray.

The courtesan placed the tray in front of Lee Gwak’s door, saying,

“Miss Cho instructed me to bring you some honey water.”

“Yes! Considering how much you drank last night, you must be very thirsty. Please drink the honey water Miss Cho has personally prepared.”

Lee Gwak’s pupils flickered slightly, feeling somewhat burdened by Cho ha’s thoughtfulness.

He had entered the Crimson Flower Brothel because of Nam Woo Gyeong, but this place didn’t suit him.

Upon arrival, Nam Woo Gyeong was tirelessly gathering various pieces of information, analyzing news from all over the Jianghu, and issuing orders.

Cheol Gwang-woo had been guarding Nam Woo Gyeong. Nam Woo Gyeong had taken a liking to Cheol Gwang-woo, and it was crucial to have his protection in case of an attack by the Blood Rain Assassins.

It seemed Lee Gwak wouldn’t need to worry about Cheol Gwang Woo for the time being.

After drinking the honey water, Lee Gwak stepped outside. Staying inside longer would have meant being served breakfast as well.

It was still early, and the streets were quiet. Most of the inns were yet to open, but some street vendors had started their business early.

Among them was a dumpling soup vendor. The dumpling soup, with its broth and perfectly cooked dumplings, was renowned for its flavor.

Without hesitation, Lee Gwak took a seat in front of the dumpling soup vendor.

“One bowl of dumpling soup, please.”

Just then, someone sat next to Lee Gwak and chimed in.

Lee Gwak looked to his side to see a young martial artist dressed in black, his face covered with a black cloth. Lee Gwak instantly recognized him.

The man pulled down the cloth covering his face, revealing a pale, handsome face that seemed to have never been touched by sunlight.

It was Cheon Wol, the youngest of the 13th squad.

Lee Gwak couldn’t help but smile at the unexpected reunion. Cheon Wol also smiled upon seeing him.

“It really is you, brother. I had a hunch.”

“How did you recognize me? Has the news of my arrival already spread?”

The reply came from behind Cheon Wol. Only then did Lee Gwak recall that Cheon Wol had ordered two extra bowls of soup. He had a companion.

Turning around, Lee Gwak saw a beautiful girl in modest attire. Her delicate features were all beautiful, but her deep, dark eyes, shining like stars, were the most striking.

Lee Gwak knew only one girl with such eyes.

“Lim Sobo? You’ve grown up to be a young woman.”

“It’s been a long time, brother.”

The girl who greeted Lee Gwak with a slight bow was Lim Sobo herself.

She naturally took the seat beside Lee Gwak.

“How did you find out I was here?”

“The guests you saved from the Mysterious Elder Nam Cheon-yang are my guests. They told me.”

Lee Gwak nodded without showing any surprise, realizing that even without his intervention with Nam Cheon-yang, Lim Sobo’s capabilities would have easily unveiled his arrival.

The Lim Sobo he knew had such abilities.

“Mad Dragon Woo Mun Pae, the Gatekeeper Assassin Moon Gwang, the Mysterious Elder Nam Cheon-yang, all renowned masters in the Jianghu. You’ve overpowered all three with your strength. What exactly happened during these six years that transformed you into such a formidable master?”

Instead of responding, Lim Sobo snorted.

When she first heard the name Lee Gwak from Yoo Sang-myeong’s niece, she recalled the same name from information she had recently obtained.

The incredible information that the Mad Dragon Woo Mun Pae and the Gatekeeper Assassin Moon Gwang have been defeated by a martial artist named Lee Gwak.

Initially, she didn’t connect this Lee Gwak with the one she knew, as his martial skills hadn’t been that impressive.

But Cheon Wol was certain this Lee Gwak was their former chief. He had witnessed Lee Gwak’s incredible martial prowess firsthand while escaping from the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Lim Sobo showed a vexed expression.

“Having such powerful martial arts and yet keeping it completely hidden.”

Lee Gwak simply smiled in response, his demeanor seemingly more irksome to her.

Just as Lim Sobo was about to speak, the stall owner served the dumpling soup.

Lee Gwak brought the bowl of dumpling soup in front of him, saying,

“I’m hungry. Let’s talk after we eat…”

Cheon Wol also picked up his spoon, agreeing.

The sound of them savoring the hot broth filled the street.

A deep frown formed on Lim Sobo’s brow.

The sight of the two enjoying their dumpling soup instead of catching up after such a long time seemed odd to her. Yet, for some reason, she found it hard to interrupt further.

Eventually, she too picked up her spoon and began eating the dumpling soup.

The soup was surprisingly delicious. Lim Sobo became immersed in it, just like the two men.

By the time they finished eating, all three were drenched in sweat.

Lee Gwak smiled contentedly, the hangover completely gone.

Cheon Wol put down his spoon, remarking,

“This place is new to me, but it’s really good. If it weren’t for you, I would have never known such a place existed in front of the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

Cheon Wol was Lim Sobo’s secret sword.

Unless she was in danger, he rarely appeared in public, and he never went out alone. Hence, he usually ate within the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Just by looking into Cheon Wol’s deep eyes, one could tell how much he had matured. Lee Gwak appreciated his thoughtful and serious gaze.

“It’s all thanks to you, brother.”

“Still together with Sobo, I see.”

“I promised to be her shadow guard, after all. After returning to the Jade Heaven Alliance, I moved to the secret court immediately.”

Once there, Cheon Wol had immersed himself into training. Although he had always diligently practiced the martial arts given by Lim Sobo, he trained even harder after moving to the Secret Court.

He was frustrated that he couldn’t be of much help to Lee Gwak during their escape from the Celestial Demon Troupe.

The Secret Court spared no support for Cheon Wol.

From elixirs to enhance his internal energy to various secret martial arts manuals, everything was provided to him. And Cheon Wol assimilated all of it into his skills.

No one knew exactly how powerful Cheon Wol’s martial prowess was now, not even Lim Sobo.

Cheon Wol blushed at Lee Gwak’s praise, but his eyes sparkled with joy.

Receiving recognition from Lee Gwak meant more to him than anything else.

“What about you, brother? What happened during those six years? Where were you?”

“I was severely injured and underwent treatment. Once I recovered somewhat, I resumed my martial arts training.”

Despite her young age, the experience and weight she carried from assisting her master in managing the vast Secret Court were evident in her gaze. Ordinary people wouldn’t dare meet her intense stare.

However, Lee Gwak remained unfazed by her penetrating look.

“You haven’t changed, always hiding things.”

“There’s nothing more dangerous in the Jianghu than revealing your true self to just anyone.”

“So, I’m ‘just anyone’ to you. That’s somewhat disappointing.”

Lim Sobo pouted her lips but soon regained her composure.

“I heard from Cheon Wol about your encounter with the young master Yong Cheon Myeong. You were the one who left a scar on his face.”

“You know the young master will bear a grudge against you for that.”

“Do you have a plan, returning here knowing the young master won’t sit idly by once he learns of your return? Fortunately, he seems unaware for now, but it won’t be long before the news of your return reaches his ears.”

“What are you suggesting? Get to the point.”

“The Secret Court will protect you. No matter how powerful the young master is, he can’t ignore the strength of the Secret Court.”

“And the price? You’re not offering this for free, are you?”

“Of course. There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Join the Secret Court. Utilize your abilities to the fullest and I will assist you.”

Lim Sobo’s voice sharpened, but Lee Gwak continued without hesitation.

“I’ve been expelled from the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“I can help with that. It’s nothing for me to have you accepted back.”

“Sobo. My ties with the Jade Heaven Alliance ended six years ago. That’s not something that can be reversed.”

“Likewise, facing Yong Cheon Myeong’s wrath is a karma I must bear. It’s not right to shift that burden onto others.”

“Besides, you say you want to help me, but it seems it’s you and the Secret Court who need help, isn’t it?”

Lim Sobo’s eyes wavered at Lee Gwak’s question.

“Phew! Damn you, brother. You won’t budge an inch. Yes, the Secret Court is in a difficult position right now. The quality of our information and the lack of skilled martial artists are significant issues. That’s why I wanted to recruit you.”

“I’m sorry, but I really can’t join the Secret Court.”

“However, I think I can help in another way. Do you know Brother Woo Gyeong has returned?”

Lim Sobo’s eyes widened at Lee Gwak’s unexpected remark.

“I’ll connect you with him. That should help improve the quality of the information you mentioned.”

“Really? If we could just get information from the Hao Clan, it would be a breath of fresh air. But will Woo Gyeong ahjussi easily agree to our request?”

“If it’s my request, he probably won’t refuse.”

Lim Sobo furrowed her brows for a moment.

The Lee Gwak she knew was not one to make promises or guarantees lightly. If Lee Gwak was offering this, there must be a significant reason behind it.

Realizing this, Lim Sobo understood it was time to give up on recruiting Lee Gwak.

Having gained one desperately desired aid, she had to let go of the other.

“Thank you, brother. I won’t make any more unreasonable requests. But in exchange, if I may say so, I’ll do my best to ensure the young master cannot harm you.”

During Lim Sobo’s speech, Cheon Wol, who had remained silent, also expressed his gratitude.

Cheon Wol had been in the most difficult position of all.

Lee Gwak was like a brother to him, and Lim Sobo was someone he deeply respected. Being caught between the two and having to push for one side’s argument was a painful ordeal for him.

Fortunately, it seemed they had reached a compromise on acceptable terms, which provided some relief.

Cheon Wol then pulled up the black cloth to cover his face again.
