Seop Yu-saeng was a very hearty person.

He loved playing the lute as much as he loved poetry and alcohol, and he would go to the ends of the earth for a good drink.

“The Maotai wine of Jangmyeong Inn is a famous liquor that does not fall short compared to those made in the mainland. This is the only place in Haenam Island where you can drink such properly made liquor. That’s why I specifically chose to stay here over the accommodations provided by the Martial Sword Troupe.”

He expressed his admiration several times, obviously enchanted by the taste of the liquor. Lee Gwak, on the other hand, was calm.

Lee Gwak did not have the ability to distinguish subtle differences to the extent of fussing like Seop Yu-saeng. It was just a bit tastier than the liquor he usually enjoyed. That was Seop Yu-saeng’s evaluation of the Maotai wine he was drinking.

“How is it? It’s impressive, isn’t it?”

“It’s impressive.”

“Ah, the reaction of this guy…”

It was when Seop Yu-saeng clicked his tongue at Lee Gwak’s lukewarm response.

“Master Seop! You’re here.”

“We’ve been looking for you for a while.”

Someone addressed Seop Yu-saeng.

The people who approached Seop Yu-saeng were a young man and woman.

Both appeared to be in their early to mid-twenties, each wearing blue martial uniforms.

Seop Yu-saeng recognized them.

“Are you from the Haenam Sect?”

In Haenam Island, only the martial artists from the Martial Sword Troupe, specifically those from the Haenam Sect, were allowed to wear blue martial attire.

The Martial Sword Troupe was organized into the Central Sect, Three Gates, and ‘Five Halls’

The Central Sect was the Haenam Sect, under which the White Blood Gate, Flowing Moon Gate, and Five Reds Gate were collectively referred to as the Three Gates.

These nine factions were the core of the Martial Sword Troupe, with the Haenam Sect at its heart.

Members of the Haenam Sect traditionally wore blue uniforms to distinguish themselves from other sect members.

In a good way, it was a sign of their strong identity, but in a bad way, it was a sign of their superiority.

In a respectful manner, they greeted Seop Yu-saeng.

“Gong Ha-seong of the Martial Sword Troupe greets master Seop Yu-saeng.”

“Leng Su-bin of the Martial Sword Troupe greets master Seop Yu-saeng”

Their greetings caused a moment of embarrassment to appear on Seop Yu-saeng’s face. The gazes of everyone in the inn were focused on him.

Gong Ha-Seong and Leng Su-bin were recognized as promising talents within the Martial Sword Troupe. Naturally, their presence drew the attention of those around.

“What brings you here?”

“We’ve come to escort master Seop.”

“Yes! The Alliance Leader specifically instructed us to invite master Seop.”

“Ah! This is unexpected…”

Seop Yu-saeng showed a perplexed expression.

Although he had been invited, he didn’t want to stay in a place as rigid as the Martial Sword Troupe. However, since the Alliance leader had specifically asked for him, he couldn’t refuse.

“Did the Alliance Leader really ask for me specifically?”

“It wasn’t necessary to go to such lengths.”

“We couldn’t possibly treat Seop Yu-saeng, a renowned figure throughout the heavens, with anything less than the utmost respect. We have prepared a fine accommodation within the Martial Sword Troupe. Please, make yourself comfortable there.”

After letting out a thoughtful hum, Seop Yu-saeng looked towards Lee Gwak.

“Would you like to join me?”

“How about you accompany me to visit the Martial Sword Troupe this time? What do you say? It’s a rare opportunity.”

“I’m sorry.”

“I’m comfortable here. I appreciate your offer, but I’d rather stay here and relax for a while.

Surprised by Lee Gwak’s refusal, Seop Yu-saeng frowned for a moment. Lee Gwak’s reaction was unexpected.

If he had made the same offer to anyone else in the inn, they would have gladly accepted. The chance to be treated as a VIP within the Martial Sword Troupe and enjoy their luxuries was not something that came along very often.

“You are very different from others. That’s not a bad thing, so I respect it. If you change your mind, come find me at the Martial Sword Troupe.

“Understood.”

“I have a feeling we will meet again.”

“I’m sorry, but that won’t happen.”

“I plan to leave this place tomorrow morning.”

“Is that so? But nobody knows what the future holds. Only the heavens know how our paths will cross, so until next time.”

Seop Yu-saeng smiled and stood up.

He then spoke to Gong Ha-Seong and Leng Su-bin,

“Let’s go.”

“Yes, please follow me.”

Gong Ha-Seong led the way, followed by Seop Yu-saeng. Leng Su-bin also started to follow them, but stopped for a moment to look back at Lee Gwak.

“What’s your name?”

“Why do you ask?”

“When someone asks, you should at least respond.”

Leng Su-bin’s voice carried a chill.

The look she gave Lee Gwak was as cold as her voice.

Though it irked him, Lee Gwak, not wanting to cause any trouble, simply replied with his name.

“Lee Gwak.”

“Lee Gwak? You seem like a newcomer to Jianghu. It’s best not to approach the alliance’s guest of honor without cause.”

“You make it sound like I approached Master Seop for some ulterior motive, is that right?”

“Hmph! Only you know the truth. I’m just giving you a warning.”

Without waiting for Lee Gwak’s reply, Leng Su-bin turned and left the inn.

Left alone, Lee Gwak looked momentarily dazed.

He hadn’t expected to hear such words from a woman he had never met before.

“Phew! As wide as the world is, there are all sorts of people.”

Lee Gwak shook his head.

Although he wasn’t in a good mood, he didn’t want to get involved with the Martial Sword Troupe any further. Lee Gwak closed his mouth and sipped his drink in silence.

*** Lee Gwak slept soundly on a plush bed for the first time in a while.

When he woke up, the sun was already high in the sky. When he opened the window, the intense sunlight hurt his eyes. But even the strong sunlight felt pleasant to Lee Gwak.

After sitting by the window and enjoying the sunlight for a while, Lee Gwak washed his face and went outside. He left the inn and went to the harbor to look for a ship that would sail from Haenam Island to the Central Plains.

The harbor was still crowded with people.

Sailors and Workers, merchants and martial artists, mingled together to form a marketplace. Lee Gwak pushed his way through the crowds to where the ships were docked.

It wasn’t hard to find a place to buy a ticket for the regular service between Haenam Island and the central plains.

Lee Gwak spoke to the person selling tickets.

“Is there a ship to the Central Plains?”

“No, there isn’t.”

“Excuse me?”

“We won’t be launching any ships for the next five days. So, if you want to go to the Central Plains, you’ll have to wait at least five days.”

“What do you mean?”

Lee Gwak looked astonished.

“During the Sea Martial Festivall, all entry and departure of ships from Haenam Island are prohibited. Didn’t you know?”

“Today is the last day we’ll accept ships, and the harbor will be closed. If you’re not in a hurry, just stay here and enjoy the Sea Martial Festival. No captain will sail anyway.”

“Really? No ships will sail at all?”

“The Sea Martial Festival is not only the Martial Sword Troupe’s event but also the biggest festival in southern Jianghu. Who would dare to sail during the festival and fall out of favor with the Martial Sword Troupe? You’ll get the same answer from any captain. Sorry.”

With the ticket seller’s firm words, Lee Gwak had no choice but to turn away dejectedly.

“Brother!”

Just then, someone called Lee Gwak from behind. When Lee Gwak turned around, he saw Mok So-pung waving from a distance.

Lee Gwak approached Mok So-pung with a happy expression.

“Brother!”

“What brings you to the harbor? Ah! You came to buy a ticket?”

“Of course you didn’t get one, right?”

“They said ships will only sail after five days.”

“It’s the time of the Sea Martial Festival, isn’t it? Even those who know how to repair ships do nothing for five days.”

“Is the ship repair going well?”

“So, You can only repair the ship after the festival ends?”

“That’s right. Thanks to that, everyone who came here is practically closed for business.”

“But you seem happy?”

“What can we do now that it has come to this? The head of the merchant group may suffer a small loss, but for us lowly ones, there’s no sweeter rest than this”.

Mok So-pung smiled happily.

In fact, he looked very excited.

He had visited Haenam Island many times, but this was his first time experiencing the festival.

“Since no ships will sail during the Sea Martial Festival, you should also relax.”

“Yes! I will.”

“By the way, where are you staying?”

“I’ve booked a room at Jangmyeong Inn. Just like you said, the food and drink there are exceptional.”

“Heh! Well done. I’ll stop by soon. See you later.”

Mok So-pung waved and walked away.

Lee Gwak watched Mok So-pung disappear into the crowd before he started walking again.

As Mok So-pung had said, since it had come to this, it didn’t seem bad to enjoy the Sea Martial Festival with a relaxed mind.

The Sea Martial Festival was held in the grand martial arts arena within the Martial Sword Troupe.

Normally only those associated with the Martial Sword Troupe could enter, but for the five days of the Sea Martial Festival, the Grand Martial Arts Arena and several other facilities were opened to the public.

It was a unique opportunity to explore the inside of the Martial Sword Troupe, one of the Ten Sects, so many people attended the Sea Martial Festival.

‘This is also an experience.’

Just as Lee Gwak was thinking positively and moving forward, it happened.

“It’s the Iron Half Sword and the Purple Shadow Goddess.”

Suddenly, a thunderous cheer erupted from behind. Turning his head, he saw a man and a woman stepping down from the gangplank of a large ship that had just docked, attracting everyone’s attention.

The man was a tall figure, over six feet. Though not particularly handsome, his intense gaze exuded an overwhelming presence. A broken Iron Half Sword hung from his waist, capturing people’s attention.

The woman descending beside him was dressed in purple silk, her figure extremely beautiful. Her voluptuous red lips especially stood out, exuding a mysterious allure.

The people at the harbor cheered upon seeing them.

Iron Half Sword, Yook Cheon-ban, and Purple Shadow Goddess, Gu Ok-rin.

Both had made their mark towards the end of the war with the Celestial Demon Troupe, achieving great deeds. Yook Cheon-ban had slain a notorious master of the Celestial Demon Troupe, the villainous Jin Kung, earning widespread fame.

Jin Kung, notorious enough to be called a demon, had killed over hundreds of martial artists from the Jade Heaven Alliance and boasted incredible martial prowess. Unexpectedly, he was killed by the young martial artist Yook Cheon-ban.

In the battle with Jin Kung, Yook Cheon-ban’s beloved sword was broken in half, yet he continued to use it. Thus, people gave him the nickname Iron Half Sword.

Purple Shadow Goddess, Gu Ok-rin, like Yook Cheon-ban, had also made a significant presence towards the end of the war with Celestial Demon Troupe, gaining fame.

The unexpected emergence of these young masters had left people awe-struck and cheering.

They were heroes born from the war.

Though they didn’t reach the status of the heirs of the Ten Sects, the Ten Lesser Skies, they were still rising stars with a fiery reputation. Their appearance was enough to stir people’s blood.

Lee Gwak silently observed the two.

Yook Cheon-ban and Gu Ok-rin seemed to enjoy the enthusiastic response as if it was expected, accustomed to such treatment.

Lee Gwak watched them for a moment before moving on.

How famous or successful they were in the Jianghu was of little interest to Lee Gwak.

He quietly left the harbor.

He thought about wandering around Haenam Island, but the streets were too crowded. Not wanting to be pushed around by people, Lee Gwak returned to the inn.

The inn, now empty of people, was quiet.

As he sat down, the innkeeper approached him.

“Why have you returned so soon?”

His face bore a puzzled expression.

The Sea Martial Festival started tomorrow, but the Martial Sword Troupe opened its doors from today. Hence, everyone who had been staying at the inn had gone out to see the Martial Sword Troupe.

Lee Gwak smiled wryly.

“I just want to quietly drink some alcohol today. Bring me some simple snacks and alcohol.”

“Understood. Please wait a moment.”

The innkeeper hurried to the kitchen.

Left alone, Lee Gwak sat and looked out the window.

In the distance, a large mountain was visible. It was the Five Finger Mountain, considered the landmark of Haenam Island.

It was a mountain filled with legends from ancient times. One of the legends claimed that the Buddha once subdued a rampaging monkey with a giant palm

The Martial Sword Troupe was located at the foot of Five Finger Mountain. Perhaps because of this, the area around Five Finger Mountain felt especially bustling.

That’s when it happened.

“May I join you?”

A beautiful voice awakened Lee Gwak from his thoughts.
