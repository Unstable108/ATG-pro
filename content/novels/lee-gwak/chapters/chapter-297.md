Nam Woo-gyeong led Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong to a shabby hut located in the deepest part of Hungry Ghost Road. Inside the room, there wasn’t even a single piece of common furniture—only a small table and a tattered blanket.

Lee Gwak thought it was typical of Nam Woo-gyeong as he took a seat.

Nam Woo-gyeong’s gaze naturally fell upon Lee Cheong.

“So, you’re Cheong. Nice to meet you. I’m Nam Woo-gyeong. From now on, call me Uncle.”

“Lee Cheong greets Uncle.”

“What a sharp-looking boy. Different from how your father was as a child.”

A satisfied smile appeared on Nam Woo-gyeong’s lips.

Lee Gwak retorted,

“I looked quite sharp when I was young, too.”

“That’s what you think.”

“Are you saying I didn’t?”

“You were sly. Always vague, like water diluted with wine. That’s why So-bo and I were completely fooled by you.”

“That was…”

Unable to come up with an excuse, Lee Gwak scratched his head awkwardly.

Seeing him like that, Nam Woo-gyeong chuckled.

“What brings you here? Weren’t you in seclusion, as if you wanted to disappear altogether? What wind blew you out, even taking your child with you?”

“Well…”

Lee Gwak explained in detail the circumstances under which he had entered the Jianghu to rescue Ki Jin-hwi.

After hearing the whole story, Nam Woo-gyeong nodded.

If he had wanted, Lee Gwak could have enjoyed all the wealth and glory in the world.Accepting Lim Sobo’s offer to join the Thousand Kingdom School could have brought him every luxury imaginable. But Lee Gwak had refused.

Instead, he had acted without hesitation to save Ki Jin-hwi—a task that would bring him neither financial gain nor fame.

Some might see Lee Gwak’s actions as foolish. But to Nam Woo-gyeong, it was quintessentially Lee Gwak.

That was the kind of person Lee Gwak was.

He was indifferent to grand ambitions or the desire for success, but when it came to protecting those within his circle, he acted without any calculation.

That’s why so many people liked Lee Gwak and why Nam Woo-gyeong cherished him like a younger brother.

“So, you’ve decided to stand against the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

“Yes!”

“Are you sure you’re ready for this?”

“What do you mean?”

“The Jade Heaven Alliance is practically your hometown. That’s why you went into seclusion, avoiding involvement even when they were throwing the world into chaos. Can you now point your sword at them?”

“I guess you could say I’ve finally realized.”

“Realized what?”

“That, as you said, with a vague attitude like water diluted with wine, I can’t achieve anything.”

“Hmm!”

Nam Woo-gyeong let out a thoughtful hum.

He suddenly scratched his arm vigorously. Goosebumps had risen on his arm without him realizing it.

‘This guy!’

A man who had chosen seclusion without taking any side had finally made up his mind.

Someone who didn’t know might think he was indecisive, but Nam Woo-gyeong, who knew Lee Gwak, understood how significant this was.

Some people make decisions without much thought, and some decide impulsively based on intuition. People often call such individuals smart or say they have good instincts.

On the other hand, Lee Gwak was slow.

He was slow to decide, carefully contemplating every possibility. Yet, once he made up his mind, he never looked back.

Slow, but weighty. Thoughtful, but firm.

This was the essence of Lee Gwak.

Now that he had decided to stand against the Jade Heaven Alliance, there would be no turning back on his decision.

That’s how steadfast Lee Gwak was.

“So, you’ve finally made your decision. Are you thinking of joining another sect?”

“No, I don’t. I just intend to make my position clear.”

“Good! That’s enough.”

Nam Woo-gyeong nodded.

It was a decision typical of Lee Gwak and also typical of his discretion.

And Nam Woo-gyeong liked that about him.

“You’ve come to me because you want to understand the current state of the Jianghu, right?”

“Yes!”

“You’ve come to the right place. Some very interesting things are happening around here.”

“Do you mean the alliance between the Nine Dragons Clan and the Myriad Merchant Troupe?”

“Oh? How do you know about that?”

“Well…”

Lee Gwak told him about the incidents that occurred while he was traveling with the Unsan Escort Agency. After hearing everything, Nam Woo-gyeong clicked his tongue.

“Ha! Entrusting so much gold to a mere escort agency? The Myriad Merchant Troupe certainly has guts.”

“They certainly do.”

“And the attackers were from the Black Market? Tell me more about them.”

Lee Gwak shared everything he knew,

He spoke about his connection with Su-wol and even the relationship between the Black Market and the White Light Sect.

“So, the Black Market was indeed the pawn of the White Light Sect.”

“You already knew?”

“I suspected as much. I had circumstantial evidence but no concrete proof, so I was keeping an eye on them. Regardless, it’s a serious problem. With the collapse of the White Light Sect and the Zealous Justice Clan, dark sects that had been hiding, like the Black Market, are emerging like bamboo shoots after rain.”

The Hao Clan’s intelligence network was the most extensive in the world. It might be inferior in quality to the Heavenly Intelligence Hall operated by the Jade Heaven Alliance, but its quantity more than made up for it.

Based on this extensive data, Nam Woo-gyeong had identified the rising sects.

“The Ten Great Sects were still restrained by their reputation. They had to package things nicely, conscious of people’s eyes. But the sects rising during these turbulent times are different. They use any means necessary. They know that if not for these chaotic times, they wouldn’t have a chance to expand.”

“Hmm!”

“Many sects will approach you, not just the Green Heaven Society, and they will do whatever it takes to recruit you, just as the Green Heaven Society did. That’s how attractive you are.”

An independent martial artist with strength rivaling the Eight Great Martial Artists—an extraordinary existence.

There were many martial artists in the world, but few had such qualifications.

For the new sects looking to establish themselves, they needed both history and a powerful central figure. In that sense, Lee Gwak was certainly an enticing figure.

If they could recruit Lee Gwak, even a third-rate sect could instantly make a name for itself.

Fame would draw people, and with the gathered followers, the sect’s influence would expand.

“By recruiting you alone, they can solve many problems. So they’ll try to bind you by any means. Be especially careful.”

“Yes! I will.”

Lee Gwak nodded.

Having been already attacked by the assassins of the Green Heaven Society, he never let his guard down in any situation.

“Good! That will suffice.”

Nam Woo-gyeong smiled as he looked at Lee Cheong.

Despite having many questions, Lee Cheong did not speak and quietly listened to the conversation between the two. He had an unusual patience and calmness for a child.

“I’m meeting my nephew for the first time, what gift should I give?”

“It’s okay if you don’t give me anything, Uncle.”

“How can that be? I have my dignity as Nam Woo-gyeong. Take this.”

Nam Woo-gyeong took something out from the drawer and handed it to Lee Cheong.

It was a small dagger.

The dagger, about the size of a child’s palm, had a strange reddish hue.

“This is the Sweat Blood Dagger. Though small, it’s made of ten-thousand-year cold iron, making it the strongest in the world, and its sharpness is beyond words. It may not be much help in a fight, but if used well, its applications are limitless.”

“This is too precious. I can’t accept it.”

“I said it’s my gift to you. Take it.”

Nam Woo-gyeong pressed the dagger into Lee Cheong’s hands.

“Father…”

Lee Cheong looked at Lee Gwak with pleading eyes. It was burdensome to receive such an extraordinary item.

“Just accept it.”

“But…”

“Isn’t it your uncle’s goodwill?”

“Sigh! I understand.”

At Lee Gwak’s words, Lee Cheong grasped the Sweat Blood Dagger tightly. He felt a cold chill in his hand.

“I will accept it gratefully. I will never use this treasure for unjust deeds, Uncle.”

“Good! That’s what I wanted to hear, kid!”

Nam Woo-gyeong stroked Lee Cheong’s head affectionately.

He had expected the boy to be somewhat naive, being Lee Gwak’s son, but he hadn’t anticipated him to be so much like his father. He didn’t dislike that at all.

Everyone he met these days were all exceedingly cunning, making Lee Cheong’s earnest and pure nature all the more endearing.

Nam Woo-gyeong shifted his gaze to Lee Gwak.

“What do you plan to do from now on?”

“For now, I plan to stay here for a few days.”

“Good choice. The Nine Dragons Clan is hosting a significant event soon. It’ll keep things interesting.”

“An event?”

“They’re holding a martial arts tournament.”

“In times like these?”

“Precisely. They need to show that they have the power to fight against the Jade Heaven Alliance so that those who have been hesitant will side with the Nine Dragons Clan.”

“Even so…”

“The gate master of the Nine Dragons Clan, Gyeong Un-cheon, is a fox in a bear’s mask. He’s quick-witted and never does anything that results in a loss. He’s trying to boost the morale of those who support the Nine Dragons Clan through the martial arts tournament. At the same time, he’s showing off to the Jade Heaven Alliance, saying, ‘Don’t provoke us recklessly; we have this much power.’ Moreover, they have ample military funds provided by the Myriad Merchant Troupe. There’s nothing to stop them. Probably countless martial artists will gather here.”

“Will the Jade Heaven Alliance just stand by and watch?”

“Hmph, they won’t be able to pay attention to this place for a while.”

A sly smile curled up on Nam Woo-gyeong’s lips.

It was clearly a sneer.

“Is there any reason?”

“They’ve been hit hard on the southern front.”

“The southern side… Do you mean the alliance between the Martial Sword Troupe and Dragon Heaven Valley?”

“That’s right! They clashed in Guizhou fifteen days ago, and the Jade Heaven Alliance suffered a great defeat. The damage is significant, and it’ll take considerable time to recover. So they won’t be able to pay attention here for the time being.”

“So that happened.”

Guizhou was thousands of miles away from here. Yet Nam Woo-gyeong was grasping events happening in such distant places as if looking at his own palm.

Once again, Lee Gwak felt the formidable nature of Nam Woo-gyeong.

Nam Woo-gyeong pointed at Lee Cheong and said, “Let Cheong participate in the martial arts tournament. It will be a good opportunity to gain experience.”

“What? But Cheong’s age is…”

“They’re also opening a youth division that kids his age can enter. The top ten are given the right to join the Nine Dragons Clan. Of course, you don’t have to join if you don’t want to. But most will; it’s a golden opportunity to become a formal disciple of the Nine Dragons Clan.”

No matter what anyone said, the Nine Dragons Clan was the dominant force in the north. With the fall of the competing Zealous Justice Clan, they were now unquestionably dominant.

A martial arts tournament that granted qualification to become an official disciple of the Nine Dragons Clan. Prodigies from all over the region would likely flock to participate.

Lee Gwak looked at Lee Cheong.

He saw Lee Cheong gently shaking his head.

“If Cheong doesn’t want to, I don’t intend to make him participate.”

“As expected.”

Nam Woo-gyeong nodded.

In truth, he had suggested it to Lee Gwak, but he knew that, given his personality, he wouldn’t make Lee Cheong participate.

“You must be tired from the long journey, so let’s have a drink and rest today.”

“Do you have good liquor? I couldn’t drink a single sip while traveling with the escort agency, so I’m yearning for it.”

“Hehe! I’ll have them bring liquor from the Four Seas Hall. I heard they recently got a shipment of excellent wine, and there should still be some left.”

The Four Seas Hall was a pleasure house operated by the Hao Clan in the Nine Dragons Clan.

It served as the eyes and ears of the Hao Clan, tasked with gathering information in Nine Dragons Clan. The Four Seas Hall was particularly famous for its delicious liquor, and the martial artists of the Nine Dragons Gate frequently visited.

Although they couldn’t go directly to the Four Seas Hall due to circumstances, here they could drink to their heart’s content.

Before long, a table laden with wine was brought into the hut.

Lee Gwak and Nam Woo-gyeong exchanged drinks.

The two men, meeting after three years, drank through the night to fill the gap of the past years. And beside them was Lee Cheong.

A middle-aged man with a commanding presence sat on a massive throne adorned with carvings of nine dragons.

The man exuded the aura of a dragon.

He wore a hero’s crown engraved with a dragon motif, and his long robe was embroidered with dragons piercing through clouds. His powerful features and piercing eyes further enhanced his draconic image.

Among the countless martial artists across the land, only one man could evoke the imagery of a dragon so vividly.

The Sea Blood Divine Sword, Gyeong Un-cheon.

The master of the Nine Dragons Clan and one of the world’s top swordmasters.

He looked down at the man bowing before him.

Gyeong Un-cheon spoke,

“You said his name was Lee Jin-moon? The one who protected the Unsan Escort Agency during the attack.”

“Yes, Sect Master.”

The man who had been bowing raised his head.

He was So Gong-yeol, the chief manager of the Nine Dragons Clan.

So Gong-yeol’s eyes were filled with reverence as he looked at Gyeong Un-cheon.

“Is there a martial artist named Lee Jin-moon in the world? One powerful enough to protect the Unsan Escort Agency?”

“To my knowledge, there isn’t.”

“Then it’s likely an alias.”

“Yes. We’ve already begun an investigation. We’ll uncover his true identity soon.”

“Make sure to uncover his true identity. If there’s potential, recruit him. If there’s a possibility he might become an enemy…”

Gyeong Un-cheon trailed off, but So Gong-yeol fully understood his intent.

“Don’t worry. I will handle it appropriately.”

Gyeong Un-cheon rose from the Dragon chair and walked toward the window.

Beyond the window, a world of ochre unfolded.

The land of the Nine Dragons.

“Chaos may bring calamity to some, but for others, it serves as fertile ground for growth.”

A faint smile graced Gyeong Un-cheon’s lips.

Dragons are destined to ascend riding the rain.

The era of chaos was the era for the Nine Dragons Clan.

“Should I be grateful to Ja Hong-cheon for allowing me to spread my wings? Heh heh!”
