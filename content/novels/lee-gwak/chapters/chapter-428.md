“Such a grand name.”

“It seems the owner wanted to flaunt his wealth and power. That’s why he gave his estate such an extravagant name. People like us could never afford to name something like that, even if we spent a fortune.”

Ahn Yu-san shook his head in disdain.

The owner of the estate likely wanted a manor worthy of the name Heavenly Martial Sect. The stones he had ordered were the kind even the wealthiest in the jianghu couldn’t easily obtain, and countless other expensive materials were being poured into its construction.

“Once it’s completed, it’ll probably be quite a sight.”

“I’d love to see it for myself when it’s finished.”

“You should come see it. It’d be worth experiencing at least once. Though I doubt it’d suit your tastes.”

Ahn Yoo-san glanced at Lee Gwak with a knowing look.

He had watched Lee Gwak since his return from the frontier to the Jianghu. Though they had parted ways for a time, he had always kept up with Lee Gwak’s news. That’s why Lee Gwak didn’t feel like a stranger to him.

The ragged, inexperienced martial artist who had once sought him out had now grown into a supreme master whose name shook the Jianghu.

Perhaps because he had invested emotionally in Lee Gwak’s journey, Ahn Yu-san sometimes felt as though Lee Gwak’s achievements were his own.

Then, as if suddenly remembering something, Lee Gwak asked:

“Ah, right! Have you completely cut ties with the Myriad Merchant Troupe?”

“Cut ties? There wasn’t much to cut. They just unilaterally stopped contacting me.”

“So they’ve completely gone silent?”

“That’s right.”

Ahn Yu-san smiled bitterly.

He had poured his heart and soul into helping the Myriad Merchant Troupe. Though he wasn’t officially a member, he had worked harder than many who were. Yet, he had received nothing in return.

It wasn’t like he helped them expecting something in return, but he couldn’t help feeling a little hollow inside.

“So, you’ve completely lost all ties with them.”

“Exactly. That’s why I’m running the Cheonghae Trade Group again. I know the world doesn’t revolve around my feelings, so I didn’t take it too hard. Still, I can’t deny there’s some resentment.”

“Isn’t that a natural reaction for anyone? I’d feel the same way.”

Perhaps comforted by Lee Gwak’s words, some of the tension in Ahn Yu-san’s face eased.

“Are you planning to contact them?”

“Sorry?”

“You just brought up the Myriad Merchant Troupe out of nowhere.”

“No, there’s no reason for me to reach out to them now. Our paths are completely different.”

“True, your temperament doesn’t align with theirs at all. The Alliance Leader may seem magnanimous on the surface, but he’s actually quite petty. He’s always calculating, and if he decides someone isn’t useful, he discards them without hesitation. Maybe that’s why I was cast aside too.”

“…”

“Either way, I wouldn’t recommend dealing with the Myriad Merchant Troupe. I’ve heard they’ve been secretly contacting various sects lately. Who knows, they might even approach you.”

“I don’t think they would. From their perspective, I’m practically their enemy, interfering with everything they do.”

Both the Nine Dragon Clan’s event and the Wudang Sect’s opening ceremony had been heavily supported by the Myriad Merchant Troupe. However, Lee Gwak ruined both events, causing the alliance to suffer massive losses. To them, he was nothing but a thorn in their side.

“The Myriad Merchant Troupe doesn’t care about enemies if they can be useful. They used to have some principles, but after the Merchant King became the Alliance Leader, all those lines disappeared.”

“Hmm.”

“So don’t be too surprised if they approach you. That’s just how they are.”

“Understood.”

“Ah, you said you founded a sect, right?”

“Yes. It’s called the Mad Martial Sect.”

“I’ll visit soon. If there’s anything I can help with, just let me know.”

“Your words alone are more than enough.”

“Don’t just take it as words. I’ll come by once this trade is done, so wait for me.”

Ahn Yu-san clapped Lee Gwak on the shoulder.

“I’ll eagerly await your visit, Great Hero An.”

“Let’s share a drink then.”

“Of course!”

Ahn Yoo-san wore a reluctant expression.

Part of him wanted to find the nearest tavern and share a drink right then and there. But he had to deliver these precious stones to their destination as quickly as possible. Only then could he collect payment and keep the merchant group running smoothly.

His subordinates had already arranged for a ship to transport the cargo. The longer they delayed, the more costs would pile up.

“Well, I should get going.”

Ahn Yoo-san signaled his men to move out. The merchant group quickly fell into orderly motion.

“Take care.”

With a parting wave, Ahn Yu-san led the Cheonghae Trade Group away.

Lee Gwak stood still, watching them go. Then Lim Ji-mun approached him.

“You must feel quite reluctant to part.”

“It’s been a while since we met, so I do feel a little sad.”

“Didn’t he say he’d visit again soon? You can catch up properly then.”

“True.”

“By the way, did he say it was Heavenly Martial Sect? The place where all those stones are going?”

“Right.”

“I’m curious. Who could the owner of that manor be?”

“Same here.”

Lee Gwak tilted his head in thought. Someone with that level of wealth would surely become famous soon enough. He didn’t need to dig for answers, he’d find out eventually.

“Let’s head out. We should move quickly too.”

“Yes!”

The two mounted their horses.

They rode off in a different direction from the Cheonghae Merchant Group.

As he rode, a faint smile touched Lee Gwak’s lips.

Though their reunion had been brief, it had lightened the heavy weight in his chest.

With a refreshed spirit, Lee Gwak made his way back to the Mad Martial Sect.

In the north, seasonal changes arrive late.

While flowers were already wilting and farmers were already working in the southern regions, the area where the Mad Martial Sect was located had just begun to bloom.

“Whew!”

Lim Ji-mun wiped the sweat from his brow as he looked toward the dark river.

Unlike Lee Gwak, who had long been indifferent to heat and cold, Ji-mun was still susceptible to the elements.

“We’re finally here. I wonder how much has changed.”

The dark river blocking their path was the Black Driver. Following it upstream would take them to Gwangmumun.

Creak, creak!

Just then, a small boat approached the two of them.

Before the boat even reached the shore, the ferryman greeted them.

“It’s you, Sect Leader! I wasn’t sure at first.”

The ferryman was one of the Mad Martial Sect’s disciples.

Lee Gwak looked at him, a bit surprised.

“How did you know to come meet us?”

“Haha! Do you see that little island in the middle of the river? We’ve built a watchtower there. You can’t see it from outside, but from the inside, you can easily spot anyone approaching by water.”

“That must’ve been Sobo’s idea.”

“Correct. There are usually a dozen martial artists stationed on the island at all times in case of emergencies.”

He added that there was also a fast boat stationed there to quickly intercept any threats.

Lee Gwak and Ji-mun boarded the boat.

It rocked briefly, then surged forward with impressive speed.

The ferryman rowed with great skill.

With each stroke of the oar, the boat glided forward several jang. A satisfied smile played on the ferryman’s lips.

Lee Gwak asked him,

“Has everything been alright while I was gone?”

“You’ll be shocked when you arrive. Just be ready.”

“Pardon?”

“It’s changed so much since you left. Brace yourself.”

“That’s something to look forward to.”

Lee Gwak smiled gently at the man’s playful tone.

While they chatted, the boat reached the Mad Martial Sect.

Even the dock was completely different.

When Lee Gwak left, it could barely handle one boat. Now, it was big enough for several large boats to dock at once.

“Wow!”

Lim Ji-mun let out an exclamation before he could stop himself.

“Sect Leader! You’ve returned!”

“The Sect Leader is back!”

Martial artists nearby ran over the moment they saw Lee Gwak.

“Have you all been well?”

“Thanks to you, yes! Welcome back, Sect Leader!”

“We welcome your safe return!”

Their bright expressions told Lee Gwak that nothing had gone wrong while he was away. If there had been any trouble, they wouldn’t be smiling like this.

Ji-mun leaned in and whispered,

“Looks like Sobo’s been doing a good job.”

“Seems so.”

“Well, she’s not the type to slack off. Let’s go in. I can’t wait to see what’s changed.”

He pulled Lee Gwak along.

“Wow!”

Ji-mun gasped the moment they stepped into the Mad Martial Sect.

Lee Gwak didn’t say anything, but his feelings were the same.

That’s how much the place had changed.

At least ten new large halls had been built. And with those halls came many new residents.

Though he hadn’t counted, it looked like their numbers had doubled.

“What’s going on?”

“Beats me.”

Ji-mun was just as stunned.

Usually, it’s hard to recruit disciples for a sect.

Especially for a newly formed one like the Mad Martial Sect. Unless you had the kind of backing the ten sects had, it was nearly impossible to grow this fast.

“Brother!”

Lim Sobo came running when she heard Lee Gwak had returned.

“Sobo!”

“You’re safe. Thank goodness.”

She smiled brightly at Lee Gwak, while Ji-mun pouted and stuck his face between them.

“I’m here too, you know.”

“Yeah, glad you’re alive.”

Sobo replied flatly and pushed his face away.

His expression crumpled, but she didn’t care. Her gaze was still on Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak glanced around and asked,

“What happened? There seem to be a lot more people than I expected.”

“I was surprised too. A lot more joined than I ever anticipated.”

Her expression darkened slightly.

This sudden influx of martial artists wasn’t necessarily a good thing.

It was proof of how chaotic the world had become—how many wandering martial artists were now without a home.

Lim So-bo hadn’t even announced the Mad Martial Sect’s founding, yet they had somehow learned of it and come seeking membership.

“Most of them came because of your reputation.”

“Me?”

“Right now, there’s hardly anyone in the Jianghu more famous than you. Of course, people would admire you. But don’t worry, I didn’t accept everyone blindly.”

Lim So-bo smiled confidently.

She had thoroughly vetted every applicant. Those with dubious pasts or ulterior motives were strictly filtered out.

To do this, she had created a dedicated team and even enlisted the help of the Hao Clan.

“Even after filtering, this many joined.”

“That’s good.”

“But numbers alone don’t mean much. We still have to assess their skills, assign them to the right teams, train them, and instill a sense of belonging. There’s so much left to do. I’ve barely been sleeping lately.”

Despite her words, her eyes shone brighter than ever.

She was exhausted, certainly, but being able to carry out her will without restrictions made her feel truly alive.

If she had had this kind of authority back when she was part of the military in Sky High Castle, she could’ve built an even greater force.

Right now, Lim Sobo was genuinely happy.

The vision she had held in her mind was becoming reality.

She was creating something from nothing and shaping it with her own hands.

For a strategist, there was no greater honor.

This moment of momentum was crucial. She had to ride this wave and push forward. If she allowed herself to rest out of satisfaction, she might stall and fall into mediocrity.

That’s why Lim Sobo kept pushing herself relentlessly, spurring herself on to devote even more to her work.

Thanks to that, Mad Martial Sect’s organizational structure was quickly solidified.

Though it still fell far short compared to the Seven Great sects, it had grown past the point where anyone could dismiss it lightly.

Lim So-bo excitedly explained everything.

Lee Gwak and Lim Ji-mun smiled as they watched her.

Just seeing her passion was enough to wash away the fatigue of their long journey.

Her explanation went on for quite some time. Much of it was beyond Lee Gwak’s understanding, and when she finally finished speaking, he said just one thing:

“You’ve done well.”

At that moment, tears welled up in Lim Sobo’s eyes.

To have her efforts and hardships acknowledged—it filled her with joy.
