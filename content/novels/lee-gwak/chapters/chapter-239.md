Mok Seon Wol stood tall atop a massive tree, as graceful as a crane. But her expression was far from calm.

The sight in the distance was enough to leave her speechless.

Thousands of martial artists were unleashing the “Heaven And Earth Net”, attacking only two individuals.

The two appeared as vulnerable as a small boat adrift in a stormy sea, surrounded by raging waves.

The waves relentlessly crashed down, and the boat seemed on the verge of capsizing at any moment.

Yet, Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang-woo were holding their ground against the waves.

No matter how colossal the waves, no matter how hard they were hit from the side, they pushed forward together, inch by inch.

The vast ocean was being split in two by their efforts.

The scene that seemed impossible was unfolding before her eyes, all thanks to Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang-woo. It stirred something deep within Mok Seon Wol.

The same was true for the 3rd and 5th blood elders, who stood on either side of her.

Even with their vast experiences accumulated over many more years than Mok Seon Wol, they had never witnessed such determination and martial prowess as what these two men were displaying now.

It wasn’t just about martial arts.

While Lee Gwak may have been a mystery, they knew that Cheol Gwang-woo was someone they could easily subdue.

Cheol Gwang-woo’s face was flushed red, and black blood continuously flowed from his mouth and nose.

While his body, trained through Vajra Demon Shadow Technique, endured the attacks, the repeated blows had caused severe internal damage. His internal organs were likely shaken, and his heart and meridians were in turmoil, making it nearly impossible for him to move.

Despite this, Cheol Gwang-woo pressed forward, enduring the pain.

With bloodshot eyes wide open, he took one step after another, advancing steadily.

The same was true for Lee Gwak.

While protecting the children as much as possible, Lee Gwak moved in sync with Cheol Gwang-woo, his every step a desperate struggle.

The 3rd and 5th blood elders were astounded by the sight of Cheol Gwang-woo and Lee Gwak.

“What could possibly drive them to such lengths?”

“It seems they are trying to protect those children.”

Whenever Lee Gwak moved, the fluttering of his robe revealed glimpses of the children he was shielding.

Even in the midst of such a fierce battle, the children remained unscathed.

The 3rd and 5th blood elders’ expressions hardened.

Regardless of their affiliations and beliefs, the two men fighting desperately to save the children didn’t seem like strangers to them.

The two men turned to Mok Seon Wol.

Mok Seon Wol was also astonished, but for a different reason.

The man she had coincidentally encountered when visiting the Jade Heaven Alliance to meet Dark Martial Empress Dan Li-yeon.

Though he was merely a low-ranking squad leader in the outer hall, something about him had left a strong impression on her, and she still remembered him clearly.

Seeing her reaction, the 3rd blood elder asked, “Do you know him?”

Mok Seon Wol didn’t know how to answer.

It felt strange to say that she knew him, because the Lee Gwak she saw now was so unfamiliar.

The martial prowess he displayed against thousands of martial artists was undeniably foreign to her.

The Lee Gwak she knew was just an ordinary outer hall squad leader.

A martial artist with mediocre skills, one among many others. But now, he appeared with overwhelming strength.

Mok Seon Wol struggled to make sense of this.

Her eyes trembled with confusion.

Now she could clearly see Lee Gwak’s face.

Yes, it was the same man she knew.

He had become a demon in battle, rampaging to protect those two children.

It was then that Mok Seon Wol recalled a name frequently mentioned in the Jianghu.

“What? That man is Sura Blade Lee Gwak?”

The 3rd and 5th blood elders’ reacted strongly to the name she had unconsciously muttered.

The title “Sura Blade” was one of the most renowned names in the Jianghu.

Only now did Mok Seon Wol realize that Sura Blade Lee Gwak and the Lee Gwak she knew were the same person.

Up until now, she had never thought to connect the two, as the gap between them seemed too vast.

Mok Seon Wol furrowed her brow.

“What could have happened to him?”

“Are you just going to stand by and watch?”

The 3rd blood elder asked urgently.

Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang-woo’s movements were growing sluggish.

They were almost at the edge of the Heaven and Earth net, approaching a small stream. A little more effort and they could break through, but their strength seemed to be reaching its limit and their speed slowed drastically.

“Grandfathers,” Mok Seon Wol called.

“Beyond that small stream is White Light Sect’s territory, right?”

“It’s not formally established, but we’ve mutually avoided crossing the stream.”

“Then this side of the stream is Dragon Heaven Valley’s territory.”

“Why are you asking obvious questions?”

The 5th blood elder responded irritably.

At that moment, the veil covering Mok Seon Wol’s face fluttered in the wind, revealing her beautiful, yet cold, expression.

“They have invaded our territory.”

The 3rd and 5th blood elders’ turned their gaze towards the small stream.

A significant number of the martial artists who had formed the Heaven and Earth net had crossed the stream.

“Grandfathers! Should we just let those who have invaded our territory go unpunished?”

The two old martial artists quickly understood the meaning behind Mok Seon Wol’s words.

Without hesitation, they leaped into action.

In an instant, they closed the distance and reached the stream. There, they unleashed their deadly martial arts against those who had crossed the stream.

With a thunderous roar, a powerful force was unleashed.

Those who had crossed the stream were struck down by the sudden onslaught. Dozens of martial artists perished in the blink of an eye.

With the situation escalating, the martial artists forming the Heaven and Earth net were thrown into chaos.

Already struggling to stop Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang-woo’s advance, the sudden appearance of these mysterious old men slaughtering their comrades threw the formation into utter confusion.

Amidst the turmoil, Ju Gwang-ui stepped forward.

“Stop! Who are you to interfere with White Light Sect’s matters?”

Ju Gwang-ui deliberately invoked the name of White Light Sect, hoping to intimidate the newcomers. However, the old warriors merely scoffed.

“Hah! Do you think Dragon Heaven Valley fears White Light Sect’s name?”

“You are from Dragon Heaven Valley?”

Ju Gwang-ui felt his heart sink and his expression hardened. The 3rd blood elder continued.

“We are one of the Ten Blood Elders of the Dragon Heaven Valley.”

Though they seldom crossed paths, he knew of the Ten Blood Elders, the top martial artists of

Dragon Heaven Valley. But he forced himself to remain calm as he spoke.

“Why are the Ten Blood Elders interfering with our business? We have a non-aggression agreement, do we not?”

“It was White Light Sect who first crossed into our territory.”

Ju Gwang-ui quickly surveyed his surroundings. He noticed the martial artists who had crossed the stream.

“Are you saying that small stream mark’s Dragon Heaven Valley’s territory?”

“Though it’s not officially documented, that stream has long been considered the boundary between Dragon Heaven Valley and White Light Sect. Both sides have been careful not to cross it.”

Recognizing her immediately, Ju Gwang-ui’s face grew even grimmer.

‘The Dark Moon Fairy herself… This day is filled with ill omens.’

Mok Seon Wol was the successor of Dragon Heaven Valley.

Her word was the word of Dragon Heaven Valley.

Yet, retreating wasn’t an option.

“We are pursuing a criminal of White Light Sect. Though we unintentionally crossed into your territory, I ask for your leniency this time. Considering our mutual respect among the Ten Sects…”

“Since when have we been so close?”

Ju Gwang-ui was at a loss for words.

Then, a loud explosion erupted from behind him, and martial artists flew in all directions, bloodied. Cheol Gwang-woo and Lee Gwak had arrived.

With the blood elders drawing attention away from them, their attackers had momentarily weakened, allowing them to break through the Heaven and Earth Net with all their might.

Their hearts pounded wildly as if they were about to burst, and their muscles screamed in agony as if they were being torn apart. Yet they remained alert.

Using his blade for support, Lee Gwak steadied himself and looked at Mok Seon Wol.

Just as she had recognized him, Lee Gwak recognized her.

“It’s been a while, Leader Lee.”

“How did you come to be here?”

“Beyond this stream is our valley’s territory. Of course, we must respond to anything that happens within it.”

Her words carried significant meaning.

Crossing the stream would place them in Dragon Heaven Valley’s territory, where White Light Sect could no longer attack.

The two men began to wade across the small stream. At that moment, Ju Gwang-ui shouted.

But neither Lee Gwak nor Cheol Gwang-woo stopped.

Unable to contain his rage, Ju Gwang-ui launched an attack. But by then, the two had already crossed the stream.

“Child! This is Dragon Heaven Valley’s land.”

The blood elders intercepted Ju Gwang-ui’s attack.

The impact left Ju Gwang-ui’s lips stained with blood.

Though a renowned expert within the White Light Sect, Ju Gwang-ui couldn’t compare to the Ten Blood Elders.

Before Ju Gwang-ui had even begun his martial journey, the Ten Blood Elders were already legendary figures in the Jianghu.

Realizing the gap between himself and the Ten Blood Elders, Ju Gwang-ui clenched his teeth in frustration. Meanwhile, Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang-woo had fully crossed the stream.

To attack Lee Gwak now, White Light Sect’s martial artists would also have to cross the stream.

The stream was not difficult to cross—it was merely ankle-deep, a few short steps.

Yet, to Ju Gwang-ui, this small stream felt as imposing and unyielding as a great wall.

Crossing this line would mean war with Dragon Heaven Valley.

In his desperation to capture Lee Gwak, he risked plunging all of White Light Sect into a catastrophic conflict.

A groan of frustration escaped Ju Gwang-ui’s lips as his body trembled with barely suppressed rage.

His furious roar echoed across the battlefield.

The martial artists forming the Heaven and Earth Net shuddered, feeling the raw intensity of his anger.

“I will not let this go, Lee Gwak. As long as I live, I will tear your heart from your chest and devour it whole. Remember my name, Lee Gwak! I am Ju Gwang-ui.”

His eyes gleamed with madness.

Noh Tae-tae had been his benefactor.

Despite having no background, Ju Gwang-ui was chosen and elevated to the rank of leader of the White Light Sect’s Destroy Heaven Squad. His guilt over failing to protect his benefactor only fueled his growing insanity.

Lee Gwak sighed as he gently set down Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah.

Though their father was drenched in blood, not a single drop had touched the children.

After briefly gazing at the children, Lee Gwak turned to face Ju Gwang-ui.

The two men stood on opposite sides of the stream, staring into each other’s eyes.

Ju Gwang-ui’s eyes blazed with fury, while Lee Gwak’s gaze remained surprisingly calm.

It was hard to believe that this was the same man who had just fought with all his strength to break through the Heaven and Earth Net.

“I will not forget this either.”

“You used my wife and my children for your own purposes. You forced my wife to carry out your cruel orders by holding my children hostage. I will never forget that.”

“And so? We extended our mercy to them. We have that right.”

“There is no such thing as an inherent right to do such things.”

“Silence! How dare you lecture me?”

“This is not a lecture. It is my resolve.”

“I will never stand idly by when my family is threatened. Even if my enemy is not White Light Sect, but the entire Ten Sects, I will fight them.”

His determination to protect his children.

His resolve to fight for his wife.

In front of all those gathered, Lee Gwak declared his unwavering will.
