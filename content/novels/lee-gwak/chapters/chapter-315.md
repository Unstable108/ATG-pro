Je Mu-hyeok’s laughter resembled that of a wild beast.

Like a fierce predator eyeing its prey, his gaze naturally oozed a deadly aura.

That was simply the nature of Heaven and Earth Sect’s martial arts.

In order to unleash its true power, one had to maximize one’s killing intent. Hence, they specifically sought out disciples who possessed an exceptionally strong appetite for violence.

Because of these requirements, only a handful of individuals each generation had the innate qualities to master Heaven and Earth Sect’s techniques properly.

There was a reason why the Heaven and Earth Sect became a one-master-per-generation sect. Geniuses with overwhelming killing aura and exceptional talent were almost non-existent.

Je Mu-hyeok was born with that aura. It was so potent that even his own parents could not withstand it and abandoned him.

For him, entering the Heaven and Earth Sect was a stroke of fortune.

Like a fish that found water, he discovered the perfect environment for himself.

Je Mu-hyeok absorbed the Heaven and Earth Sect’s techniques like a sponge soaked in water, and eventually achieved something no one in the sect’s history had been able to accomplish.

He was confident that no martial artist his age could defeat him.

Je Mu-hyeok was so arrogant that he even looked down on the Ten Lesser Skies. Although one could not know the depths of martial arts without a real confrontation, his confidence pierced the heavens.

However, his pride was brutally crushed one day by an unknown martial artist.

His name was Go Geom Wol.

Go Geom Wol was truly formidable.

Even Je Mu-hyeok, who considered himself the greatest talent under the heavens, couldn’t withstand his onslaught for even thirty seconds.

After facing Go Geom Wol, Je Mu-hyeok realized that there were heavens above the heavens, and he genuinely admired him.

Since then, Je Mu-hyeok followed Go Geom Wol.

The fact that Go Geom Wol was the young master of the Celestial Demon Troupe was of little importance to him. After all, the Heaven and Earth sect itself leaned more towards the demonic path than the orthodox teachings.

Go Geom Wol never promised Je Mu-hyeok a sweet future. Je Mu-hyeok simply followed him out of pure admiration.

He was not alone. Many young martial artists in Jianghu admired and sincerely followed Go Geom Wol, just like Je Mu-hyeok.

One of them was Jin Woo-seon from the Zealous Justice Clan.

After the Zealous Justice Clan was obliterated by the Jade Heaven Alliance, Jin Woo-seon pledged himself entirely to Go Geom Wol. He was currently absorbing any sect that could be of help to Go Geom Wol.

As such, they liked him and followed him wholeheartedly.

This was not the typical loyalty seen in master-servant relationships. Their own hearts simply told them so.

Jin Woo-seon spoke to Je Mu-hyeok:

“The biggest obstacle to Geom Wol’s plans will likely be Lee Gwak.”

Lee Gwak was a very peculiar existence.

He had clawed his way up from the very bottom of the Jade Heaven Alliance, becoming an absolute master through his own strength.

No one in the past hundred years had accomplished a rise like Lee Gwak. He was such an atypical presence.

Jin Woo-seon considered Lee Gwak to be a significant barrier to Go Geom Wol’s future.

His martial prowess was that impressive.

Especially since Lee Gwak had inflicted a severe internal wound on Go Geom Wol three years ago, which had shaken everyone to the core.

It was something that neither Jin Woo-seon nor Je Mu-hyeok had ever managed to do—and Lee Gwak had succeeded.

From that moment on, Jin Woo-seon began paying close attention to Lee Gwak.

They had felt somewhat relieved over the last three years, during which Lee Gwak had gone silent. They assumed he had retired from the Jianghu completely. But recently, Lee Gwak had reemerged—and his unimaginable feats had sent ripples through the land.

His fame soared to the heavens, and many had once again turned their eyes to him.

It was not a welcome development for Jin Woo-seon. So, he requested Je Mu-hyeok to rattle Lee Gwak.

A menacing killing aura flashed in Je Mu-hyeok’s eyes.

Over the past three years, through intense training, he had completed the final technique of Heaven and Earth’s sect—Hundred Beasts, Ten Thousand Fists.

Because of that, his confidence was at an all-time high.

Je Mu-hyeok strode toward Han So Cheon and spoke:

“I hope you understand there’s nothing personal about this.”

“What a cowardly move for someone so huge.”

“What?”

“You’re obviously not here with good intentions. You came brimming with killing intent, and now you’re trying to rationalize your actions as if that would erase your shame?”

“Huh! You’ve got quite a sharp tongue. Must be because you’re that man’s woman.”

Je Mu-hyeok snorted in disbelief. But only for a moment—he then released an oppressive killing intent.

The terrifying force dominated the area, causing Han So Cheon’s face to turn pale.

She had set down her sword three years ago.

While she hadn’t entirely forgotten the martial skills she had learned, her senses had long since dulled. It was uncertain if she could handle someone with such terrifying killing intent in her current state.

Above all, her skills were those of an assassin.

It was most effective when striking an unsuspecting enemy from the shadows. In broad daylight, in a direct confrontation, it had its disadvantages.

Han So Cheon was at a severe disadvantage. Yet she could not retreat. She had someone she had to protect.

If it meant protecting Lee Soo-ah, she could sacrifice her own life without hesitation.

For the first time in a long while, a murderous glint appeared in Han So Cheon’s eyes.

The ordinary housewife façade vanished. She summoned the instincts of an assassin.

“Looks like you were something back in the day? But it’s useless now.”

Je Mu-hyeok scoffed at Han So Cheon and lunged.

Paht!

In a single step, he closed the gap between them to nothing.

A ferocious strike exploded toward Han So Cheon.

Kwaang!

It was called the Great Tiger Strike because it slammed into its target with the force of a charging tiger.

The blow sent Han So Cheon flying as though her strings had been cut.

Even though she managed to cross her hands defensively before impact, the force was too great, and she ricocheted back.

Je Mu-hyeok rushed after her as she spun through the air. A terrifying energy gathered around his massive fist.

Hwoong!

He swung his fist again at Han So Cheon.

Just then, Han So Cheon twisted her body and kicked her own left foot with her right.

It was Steps to Heaven, a footwork technique used to leap in mid-air.

In an instant, she evaded Je Mu-hyeok’s attack and reached out a hand. The iron poker stuck near the thatched hut sprang into her grip.

Swiik!

The sharp iron poker, like a sword, flew towards Je Mu-hyeok’s forehead.

“Hmph!”

Clang!

Je Mu-hyeok sneered and swatted the iron poker away with his fist.

His fist was trained to be harder than iron, so a blunt poker like this couldn’t even scratch him.

Je Mu-hyeok’s fingers curled like the claws of a beast, brushing over Han So-cheon’s entire body.

It was one of the ultimate moves of the Hundred Beasts, Ten Thousand Forms Fists, the Dragon’s Claw.

Chwahak!

Han So Cheon avoided his attack by a hair’s breadth. Cold sweat trickled down her back.

Je Mu-hyeok’s attacks were truly terrifying.

He possessed the sharp senses and instincts of a beast. He predicted Han So Cheon’s every move with uncanny precision, leaving her no choice but to fall into a defensive position.

To counter him, she had no choice but to fully revert to being the assassin Han So-cheon.

She hated going back to her past more than death itself, but there was no other choice now.

Her eyes were heavy with killing intent.

Swoosh!

Instead of a sword, the poker she held targeted Je Mu-hyeok’s vital points.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

They exchanged more than ten moves in the blink of an eye.

Each time Je Mu-hyeok’s fists collided with the poker, it nearly broke from the stress. But Han So-cheon, with her exquisite control of strength and sense, kept it from snapping.

As time passed, her assassin’s senses slowly returned.

The senses she had when she killed countless people.

A terrible loathing for herself surged toward her. Yet Han So-cheon clenched her teeth and endured.

Her emotions were not important right now.

Spit!

For the first time, her attack grazed Je Mu-hyeok’s face. His left cheek was sliced open, blood flowing down. But Je Mu-hyeok, uncaring about the wound, continued to attack Han So-cheon.

Kwaang! Kwaang!

His strikes pummeled the earth, cracking and overturning the ground.

Han So Cheon’s back was damp with cold sweat.

Her face had long since turned pale.

‘If only I had my sword…’

The iron poker in her hand was already at its limit.

Bang!

As Je Mu-hyeok’s next strike collided, the hoe shattered into pieces, and Han So-cheon’s weak point was exposed.

“This is the end.”

Je Mu-hyeok’s eyes gleamed as he thrust his fist towards Han So-cheon’s exposed point.

Swoosh!

Just as Han So-cheon clenched her teeth and braced for the impact,

“Mom! Duck your head.”

Suddenly, Lee Soo-ah’s voice came from behind.

Without a second thought, Han So-cheon immediately ducked her head.

Swoosh!

At that moment, a round object passed over her head towards Je Mu-hyeok.

“Hmph!”

Je Mu-hyeok snorted in contempt and swatted the round object flying towards him.

Thump!

But the round object didn’t bounce off; instead, it burst on impact.

Thump!

But the moment his fist connected, the round object burst apart instead of deflecting away.

The object was filled with a black liquid that drenched Je Mu-hyeok’s entire body.

‘Oil?’

The intense smell that tickled his nostrils was unmistakably that of oil.

In an instant, Je Mu-hyeok’s complexion changed.

“Could it be?”

He looked in the direction from which the oil-filled pouch had flown. There, a small girl was aiming a flaming arrow at him, ready to release it.

“You?”

Whizz!

At that moment, Lee Soo-ah released the bowstring.

The arrow flew at a terrifying speed. Je Mu-hyeok, who was mid-air attacking Han So-cheon, had no way to dodge it.

“Damn it!”

Je Mu-hyeok swiftly deflected the arrow with his hand.

The collision shattered the arrowhead, sending sparks and flames in all directions. Although he managed to knock the away arrow, he could not stop the bursts of fire.

Fwoooosh!

In the blink of an eye, flames spread over the oil, and a fiery blaze swallowed Je Mu-hyeok whole.

Lee Soo-ah hurried over to Han So-cheon.

“Mom! Are you okay?”

“I’m… okay!”

“We need to get out of here fast.”

Lee Soo-ah took Han So-cheon’s hand, and they both used their qigong to accelerate away.

The two vanished in an instant.

Right after they disappeared, Je Mu-hyeok spread his arms wide.

Boom!

A burst of fierce light erupted, scattering the flames and oil that had clung to his body in every direction.

Although he used his protective qi to avoid severe burns, frustration was evident on his face.

Although he used a protective energy shield to avoid severe burns, frustration was plain on his face.

“That little bitch..”

He surveyed the surroundings, but Han So Cheon and Lee Soo-ah were nowhere to be found.

“I’ll make sure they pay for this.”

Gritting his teeth, he took off in pursuit.

***

Meanwhile, the journey to the Hao Clan’s headquarters had been uneventful.

There was no pursuit from the Nine Dragons Clan, and no significant incidents occurred. This allowed Lee Gwak’s group to travel comfortably on horseback for the past few days, taking ample rest.

“Let’s rest there today.”

Seeing a village in the distance, Nam Woo-gyeong suggested.

They had slept outdoors the previous night, leaving everyone stiff and sore. Since they were recovering from injuries, sufficient rest was essential.

The village was sizable enough to have an inn that could accommodate the three of them.

After dropping their horses off at the stable, the three entered the inn.

It was still before sunset, so the inn was relatively quiet.

“Welcome!”

Seeing customers walk in after hours of emptiness, the innkeeper beamed with delight.

“Do you have rooms available?”

“Yes, plenty. We have single and triple rooms. Which would you like?”

“One double room and one single room, please.”

“Understood.”

The innkeeper grinned.

Usually, a three men group traveling together would rent just one room, so renting two naturally brighten his day.

Nam Woo-gyeong turned to Lee Gwak.

“Why don’t you two order some food and eat first? I’m stepping out for a bit.”

“Understood.”

Lee Gwak nodded without complaint.

Nam Woo-gyeong gave a brief smile before leaving the inn.

Neither Lee Gwak nor Lee Cheong found his behavior odd. They had seen him do this in every village they came across: scoping out the atmosphere, searching for any sign of Hao Clan disciples, and making contact if needed. He relentlessly gathered information.

Witnessing Nam Woo-gyeong—the young master of Hao Clan—so diligently carry out his duties day after day left a strong impression on Lee Cheong.

If even someone in his position worked relentlessly, Lee Cheong couldn’t afford to waste a single moment either.

He trained even harder, immersed in both thought and martial practice.

Lee Gwak glanced at Lee Cheong for a moment, then called the innkeeper over and placed a simple order: stir-fried pork, two bowls of thin noodles, and a bottle of wine.

As they waited for their food, more guests began to arrive.

“Innkeeper, do you have rooms?”

“Of course.”

“Let’s order some food here.”

“Yes!”

What had been a quiet inn suddenly buzzed like a village market. The innkeeper, busy attending to the guests, wore a genuinely happy smile.

Watching him, a smile naturally appeared on Lee Gwak’s face as well.

Some people conquer the Jianghu and remain unhappy, while others, content with a single day of good business, beam as though they’ve gained the entire world.

Watching the innkeeper brought Lee Gwak’s own family to mind, waiting back on Mount Qilian.

So Cheon… Soo-ah…

He found himself quietly repeating the names of Han So Cheon and Lee Soo-ah as thoughts of them tugged at his heart.
