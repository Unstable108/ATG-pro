“Huhuhu!”

Lim Ji-mun couldn’t stop laughing.

His horse was loaded with bottles of liquor.

They had been personally delivered by Yeon Gyeong-san, and of all the liquors produced by the Yeon Family Brewery, these were of the highest quality.

Even after drinking all night, Lim Ji-mun couldn’t stop smiling as he looked at the bottles. Lee Gwak clicked his tongue at the sight.

“Are you that happy?”

“Of course! Just wait and see, brother! Right now, not many people know about it, but the Yeon Family Brewery will become famous in no time. Once that happens, even if you want to drink it, you won’t be able to get your hands on it.”

Lim Ji-mun gazed at the bottles on the horse’s back with a dreamy expression, as if he had obtained some priceless treasure.

Lee Gwak shook his head and looked ahead.

They still had a long way to go, so they needed to hurry. Even though they were on horseback, if they let their guard down, they might be late for the opening ceremony.

Fortunately, most of the snow that had blanketed the world had melted by now. In particular, the main roads used by travelers were completely clear.

The branches were still bare, but in a little while, new buds would begin to sprout.

The harsh winter, which had seemed like it would never end, had finally retreated before the arrival of spring.

But the coming of spring wasn’t entirely a cause for celebration.

Now that spring was here, the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Seven Sects, which had hibernated like beasts, would begin to stir again.

And to make matters worse, the Wudang Sect was now in the mix.

It wouldn’t be a problem if only Wudang started moving. But Lee Gwak feared that the sects that had sealed their gates alongside Wudang might resume activity as well.

If that happened, it would be the beginning of an unprecedented era of chaos.

The turmoil that had plagued the Jianghu so far would pale in comparison to the storm that was about to engulf it.

“Huu…”

The thought of endless hurdles made Lee Gwak sigh briefly. But it lasted only a moment.

He quickly regained his composure.

“Man proposes, but Heaven disposes.”

After all, there was a limit to what humans could achieve on their own.

If Heaven truly stood with him, then even in the most impossible situations, it would provide him a path to turn things around.

Lee Gwak decided to take it easy.

There was no point in worrying about things that hadn’t even happened yet.

‘So-cheon…’

Suddenly, he missed Han So-cheon and the children.

It had already been over half a year since he last saw them.

Being apart for so long made him miss them even more.

He missed So-cheon’s quiet, trusting face, and he wanted to hear the endless chatter of Lee Soo-ah and the steady voice of Lee Cheong.

Lee Gwak hoped they would soon pass through the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall and join him.

Lost in thought, he kept riding, and before he knew it, night had fallen.

Lee Gwak and Lim Ji-mun found a suitable spot and camped for the night.

Traveling by day and camping by night, they eventually arrived in Xinzheng.

Xinzheng was a city near Dengfeng, where the Shaolin Temple was located.

In the past, it had thrived, but after the Shaolin Temple chose to close its gates, the city also fell into decline.

It was a stark contrast to Huayin County, where Mount Wudang was beginning to show signs of vitality.

As they looked around Xinzheng, Lim Ji-mun spoke.

“How long do you think Shaolin will remain closed? Seeing how Wudang is holding an opening ceremony, don’t you think they must also be itching to re-enter the world?”

“Hard to say.”

“If it were me, I’d be restless. They sealed themselves off around the same time, and now Wudang’s making a huge show of reopening. That must make them anxious.”

“Could be.”

If the Shaolin Temple were to reopen its gates following the Wudang Sect, the Jianghu would undoubtedly plunge into chaos.

Lee Gwak silently hoped that the Shaolin Temple would exercise restraint.

Though they were once revered as the greatest in the Jianghu and unlikely to act rashly, he still hoped they would avoid reopening during this critical time.

As Lee Gwak and Lim Ji-mun chatted, they arrived at the largest inn in Xinzheng.

Having camped out all this time, both men longed for a soft bed and a warm bath.

“Welcome!”

A young servant rushed forward at the sight of them.

Lee Gwak handed him the reins and asked,

“Are there any rooms available?”

“You’re in luck—there’s one left.”

“In luck?”

“Hehe! An escort agency arrived just an hour ago and took almost all the rooms. If you’d been any later, even the last one would’ve been taken.”

“That’s fortunate.”

“Haha! Please, go on inside. I’ll take care of your horses and make sure they’re well-fed.”

“Thanks. Give them warm oats and fodder.”

Lee Gwak tossed the attendant a coin.

“Thank you!”

The attendant beamed, bowing deeply at the unexpected tip.

Lee Gwak and Lim Ji-mun exchanged amused glances before stepping inside.

The inn was already crowded with people.

As the innkeeper had said, an escort agency had practically rented out the entire place.

Lee Gwak scanned the room—then his eyes widened.

Among the crowd was a familiar face.

Just then, someone called out to him.

“Wait—isn’t that Hero Lee?”

Lee Gwak turned his head and saw a middle-aged man approaching

He quickly offered a respectful greeting.

“Escort leader So!”

“It really is you! I thought I was seeing things.”

It was So Goo-san, the escort leader of Jeon-gong Escort Agency.

Lee Gwak looked around and said,

“Then the escort group staying here must be Jeon-gong Escort Agency.”

“That’s right. I never imagined I’d meet you here.”

“Is Jung-gyeong here?”

“He’s out receiving the goods, but he’ll be back soon. Still, what a fateful encounter. To meet you here, of all places.”

“Indeed.”

The Jeon-gong Escort Agency was the same group Lee Gwak had coincidentally traveled with on his way to the Bang Clan’s Inn.

Back then, he had befriended their young leader, Oh Jung-gyeong.

No one could have predicted they’d cross paths again like this.

So Goo-san’s gaze shifted to Lim Ji-mun next to Lee Gwak.

“And this gentleman is…?”

“Ah! This is my sworn younger brother, Lim Ji-mun. Ji-mun, greet him properly. Escort Leader So is a seasoned veteran who practically leads the Jeon-gong Escort Agency. He’s also the sworn brother of my friend.”

At Lee Gwak’s introduction, So Goo-san and Lim Ji-mun exchanged polite bows.

“Pleasure to meet you, Hero Lim. I’m So Goo-san of the Jeon-gong Escort Agency.”

“Junior Lim Ji-mun greets Escort Leader So. It’s an honor to meet you.”

“The honor is mine, meeting Grandmaster Lee’s sworn brother. If it’s not too presumptuous, would you care to join us?”

“Of course!”

Lim Ji-mun accepted the invitation without hesitation.

So Goo-san guided them to his table.

“Hero Lee”

“Long time no see!”

The escorts guards of the Jeon-gong Escort Agency stood up one by one to greet Lee Gwak.

He acknowledged each of them before taking a seat at the table So Goo-san had prepared.

It was already laden with generous servings of food.

“Please, sit.”

“Thank you.”

Lee Gwak and Lim Ji-mun took their seats without hesitation.

So Goo-san looked at Lee Gwak with a thoughtful expression.

Lee Gwak had disappeared all winter without a trace.

He’d often wondered where he might be, and now, to run into him like this, was a pleasant surprise.

‘It really must be fate. The bond Jung-gyeong formed with this man clearly wasn’t just luck.’

Lee Gwak was no ordinary figure—he was already a renowned powerhouse in the Jianghu. For someone like him to become friends with Oh Jung-gyeong, regardless of status, was a tremendous boon for the Jeon-gong Escort Agency.

Lee Gwak and So Goo-san chatted amicably.

Though they had been somewhat awkward when they first parted, reuniting after so long made the conversation flow naturally.

Meanwhile, Lim Ji-mun observed So Goo-san and the Jeon-gong Escort Agency with keen curiosity.

‘The Jeon-gong Escort Agency—an escort agency connected to my brother.’

That fact alone made them worthy of respect in his eyes.

Just then—

“I’m back!”

A clear voice rang out from the inn’s entrance.

“Leader!”

“Welcome back!”

The escorts of the Jeon-gong Escort Agency scrambled to their feet.

The owner of the voice was none other than their leader, Oh Jung-gyeong.

Unaware of Lee Gwak’s presence, he continued giving orders.

“Escorts Lim and Jeon, inspect the goods immediately and cover them with waterproof sheets. They’re valuable, so we’ll guard them in three shifts until we depart tomorrow.”

“Understood!”

“I’ll take the first watch!”

The two assigned escorts responded energetically before heading outside.

Oh Jung-gyeong watched them leave for a moment before scanning the inn.

Then his eyes widened.

He had spotted Lee Gwak.

“You—how are you here?”

“Long time no see.”

Lee Gwak stood and approached him.

Oh Jung-gyeong gripped his hand tightly.

“It really is you! What brings you here?”

“I’m just passing through for business. I had no idea you and the Jeon-gong Escort Agency would be here.”

“So it’s a coincidence?”

“Seems so.”

“Haha! Heaven must be looking out for me. Who would’ve thought I’d run into you again like this?”

Oh Jung-gyeong burst out laughing.

His face was filled with joy—he was genuinely happy to see Lee Gwak.

His gaze shifted to Lim Ji-mun behind Lee Gwak, and Lim Ji-mun stepped forward and bowed.

“Pleased to meet you. I’m Lim Ji-mun, Brother Lee Gwak’s sworn brother. I hope you’ll treat me kindly.”

“Gwak’s sworn brother?”

“If you’re Gwak’s brother, then you’re like a brother to me as well. I’m Oh Jung-gyeong. As you can see, I run a humble escort agency. If you’re fine with that, I’d love to call you brother too.”

“Haha! Of course I’m fine with that. From today on, I’ll regard you as an elder brother.”

Lim Ji-mun effortlessly won Oh Jung-gyeong over with his charm.

Lee Gwak shook his head at the sight.

Just days ago, Lim Ji-mun had befriended Yeon Gyeong-san, the owner of the Yeon Family’s Brewery. Now, he was already getting chummy with Oh Jung-gyeong.

That kind of social skill was something Lee Gwak could never match.

Still, thanks to Lim Ji-mun, the atmosphere grew even livelier.

They sat around the table, sharing drinks.

Clink!

Their cups met, and they downed the liquor in one go.

“Phew! Now I feel alive again.”

Oh Jung-gyeong wiped the liquor from his lips as he spoke.

Lee Gwak studied him.

“Seems like you’ve had a rough time. Was the client difficult?”

“Not exactly. I was just troubled by the destination of the cargo.”

“Must be a special place.”

“Mount Wudang.”

“For the Wudang Sect’s Opening Ceremony?”

“Exactly! The client is a disciple from the Wudang Sect.”

Oh Jung-gyeong gave a wry smile.

The person who commissioned the job was a successful merchant from the region.

His grandfather had once been a secular disciple of the Wudang Sect, and many years ago, the family had relocated to this area.

The merchant did quite well for himself, and his children and grandchildren continued the business, growing it even further.

Moreover, the Wudang Sect had been sealed for a hundred years, making it impossible to accept new secular disciples.

Yet, the merchant proudly identified as part of the Wudang lineage—believing that since his grandfather had been a disciple, he too was family.

“This must be the influence of a renowned sect,” Oh Jung-gyeong mused. “Even after a century of seclusion, their disciples still carry that pride. They never let go of their sect’s prestige.”

“Hmm.”

“It’s been a hundred years since they became independent, yet they still consider themselves Wudang disciples, sending lavish gifts. It’s admirable—and a little terrifying. Who knows how many others like him are out there? I can only imagine the mountain of treasures that will pile up at the Wudang Sect’s opening ceremony. With their existing influence and now astronomical wealth, their power might rival even the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

Lee Gwak’s expression darkened.

Through Jung-gyeong’s words, he had come to realize anew the true might of a prestigious sect.

‘So that’s why he seemed so confident…’

Lee Gwak thought of the Wudang Sect’s head disciple.

Jinghae.

His gaze had been more that of an ambitious martial artist than a serene Taoist. And his eyes were clearly fixed on Lee Gwak.

‘Avoiding a confrontation with him may be impossible.’

With the Mad Martial Sect still in its early stages, Lee Gwak hoped to avoid unnecessary conflicts. But deep down, he knew better than anyone that it wouldn’t be so simple.

No matter how renowned a martial artist he was, he couldn’t escape the winds of chaos.

Those winds were pushing him straight toward Mount Wudang.

“Sigh…”

Lee Gwak exhaled softly, and Oh Jung-gyeong clapped him on the shoulder.

“You’ll sink into the ground at this rate. I don’t know what’s weighing on you, but for today, forget everything and just drink.”

Lee Gwak stared at his cup for a moment before chuckling.

For some reason, just looking at Oh Jung-gyeong’s face made his worries fade.

There was nothing better than reuniting with an old friend.

He raised the cup to his lips.
