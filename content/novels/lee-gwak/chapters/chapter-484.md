The Moon Shadow Six Fairies served alongside Saintess Gu Mun-hye and each boasted exceptional martial prowess.

It was thanks to them that Gu Mun-hye could raise her voice within the Celestial Demon Troupe, overflowing with martial heroes and ambitious men.

To her, they were more than subordinates — closer to sisters who had shed blood together.

Thus, Gu Mun-hye cherished them above all and always kept them by her side. For her to send them away now to block Lee Gwak meant the sense of crisis she felt toward him was immense.

She could occasionally glimpse the futures of others, yet when it came to matters involving Lee Gwak, she could see nothing.

This only deepened her unease.

She had already lost Jin-ryeong, the eldest of the Six Fairies, and had failed to kill Lee Gwak within the Endless Prison. These events carved deep scars in her heart, and as time passed, the wounds only festered.

Gu Mun-hye believed she absolutely had to prevent Lee Gwak from interfering with the Thousand Kingdom School. That’s why she sent out her most cherished Moon Shadow Six Fairies.

Even though she knew the probability of their death was higher than their survival.

Oh Cho-hye, the Second Immortal, who had led the Wolyoung Six Immortals since the death of the First Immortal, Jinryeong, stepped forward.

“Lee Gwak!”

Her eyes were filled with intense hatred and venom.

The First Immortal, Jin-ryeong, was like both a big sister and a mother figure to the Moon Shadow Six Fairies. Oh Cho-hye, too, had trusted and relied on Jin-ryeong more than anyone.

She didn’t know how much she had wept when she heard the news that Jin-ryeong had lost her life to Lee Gak. She had vowed revenge against Lee Gwak, and finally, she met him again today.

“I should have killed you back then…….”

Oh Cho-hye gritted her teeth.

If they had killed Lee Gwak when he entered the Celestial Demon Troupe as a member of the envoy from the Jade Heaven Alliance over a decade ago, this trouble would never have happened.

No one could have predicted that shabby martial artist would grow into a herp [a] commanding the Jianghu with immense authority.

Oh Cho-hye had clearly had a chance to kill Lee Gwak. The fact that she carelessly missed that opportunity filled her with rage.

‘It’s not too late even now. I must kill him to avenge Sister Jinryeong and eliminate a future threat.’

Oh Cho-hye exchanged glances with the remaining four Immortals.

The faces of the four fairies were just as resolute as Oh Cho-hye’s. They, too, were staking everything to kill Lee Gwak today.

They knew Lee Gak was strong.

They also knew they couldn’t handle him by normal means.

So, they had brought all the elites of the Celestial Lunar Palace.

The murderous gazes of the Celestial Lunar Palace martial artists fixed on Lee Gwak.

Instantly, Cheol Gwang-woo grew furious and stepped forward.

“How dare you glare at my brother like that? Do you all have a death wish?”

Of all things, what he could not endure was anyone casting such hostile eyes toward Lee Gwak, whom he revered as the sky itself.

Boom!

Cheol Gwang-u, already terrifying in appearance, grew even more fearsome as he unleashed his killing intent.

Having mastered the Vajra Demon Shadow Art, his body was harder than steel, and the madness he radiated crushed the spirits of all around.

“Urgh!”

“W-what is this…?”

The Celestial Lunar Palace martial artists were shocked. None of their intelligence reports had ever mentioned a man like that at Lee Gwak’s side.

The third fairy, Gu Yeon-su, cried out:

“Don’t panic! He’s just a servant tagging along with the Sura Blade!”

“Servant? He’s my [b] younger brother, you damned bitch!”

Cheol Gwang-u’s fury exploded toward her.

“Did you call me a bitch?”

Enraged, Gu Yeon-su charged at Cheol Gwang-woo. The martial artists of the Celestial Lunar Palace followed behind her.

“Uwaaa!”

“Kill them!”

Cheol Gwang-woo roared at the enemies swarming forward like a tidal wave.

“Alright! Let’s all die together!”

The ferocity he had suppressed for so long exploded.

KWAKWAKWA-KWANG!

As they clashed, explosive sounds erupted, and fierce qi waves swept through like a storm.

The Fifth Fairy, Seongha, glanced at them but did not move.

Although she wanted to help Gu Yeon-su, she had a greater mission.

The gazes of Songha and the other four [c] fairies remained fixed on Lee Gwak.

Even while watching Cheol Gwang-woo fight, Lee Gwak did not move.

Lee Gwak, standing still as if indifferent to the world, emitted an overwhelming pressure.

Regardless of his will, his mere presence dominated the surroundings.

The Second Fairy, Oh Cho-hye, walked towards Lee Gwak and spoke.

“Today, we will die.”

“…….”

“But our deaths will not be in vain.”

At Oh Cho-hye’s words, Im Hwayeon, Songha, and Cho Yuseon gritted their teeth.

They raised their energy and moved in step with Oh Chohye’s pace.

An incredible force explosively emanated from the bodies of the four Immortals. It was energy surpassing their usual limits.

At her words, Lim Hwa-yeon, Song Ha, and Cho Yu-seon bit their lips hard.

Gathering their strength, they moved in step with her. [d]

Before coming here, they had all taken the Mad Blood Pill. A secret formula of the Celestial Demon Troupe, once swallowed it exploded every ounce of power and potential, multiplying their strength severalfold.

But the cost was cruel.

At best, one would be crippled for life. At worst, one would die.

The Moonshadow Six Fairies weren’t the only ones who had taken the Mad Blood Pill. All of the Celestial Lunar Palace martial artists present had also taken it.

The pill unleashed not only their potential, but also the madness latent within them.

“Lee Gwak! I will kill you!”

With a sharp cry, Oh Cho-hye launched herself at Lee Gwak.

SWISH!

The ribbon she wielded flew towards Lee Gwak.

In that instant, Lee Gwak moved.

The Star Soul was already in his hand.

Lee Gwak thought words were unnecessary.

Their objective was clear anyway.

He had to reach the Thousand Kingdom School in the shortest time possible, and they had to stop him by any means necessary.

One side had to disappear from this world.

SHWIT!

His blade split the air.

The attack was impossible to block alone, but the four fairies moved as one and parried it.

Having been together since birth, the Moon Shadow Six Fairies had reached a state of telepathic understanding that allowed them to communicate without words.

Even without verbal expression, they read each other’s thoughts and moved in perfect unison.

CLANGCLANGCLANG!

Lee Gwak’s blade and their weapons crossed dozens of times in the air.

Thus began the fierce battle between the one seeking to break through and the ones determined to block.

Go Geom-wol looked at the surrounding scenery from atop his horse.

“It’s certainly different.”

For a hundred years, the place where the Celestial Demon Troupe resided was a remote area far from the Jianghu. It was humid year-round with little seasonal change, always teeming with poisonous creatures and insects. Because of this, the martial artists of the Celestial Demon Troupe could never let their guard down.

Thanks to this, the martial artists of the Celestial Demon Troupe grew strong from childhood. The tough disposition formed in their youth clearly greatly aided their growth as martial artists.

The martial artists of the Celestial Demon Troupe even loved the barren environment. Because the environment was harsh, they had to become strong themselves to survive. But at some point, that kind of atmosphere gradually disappeared within the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Having perfectly adapted to their surroundings, they no longer felt the need to improve. Meanwhile, the Jianghu had developed and produced martial artists like Lee Gwak.

Go Geom-wol admired and loved that Jianghu.

Above all, he didn’t want the future generations of the Celestial Demon Troupe to continue living in a barren environment.

‘To do that, I must crush the Thousand Kingdom School. Subduing the Thousand Kingdom School is almost equivalent to crossing the Nine Mountain Ranges.’

He felt newly grateful to Ja Hong-cheon.

It was thanks to Ja Hong-cheon dividing the Jianghu that he could defeat the Ten Great Sects one by one.

‘Still, it’s too early to relax. I must not let my guard down until I’ve perfectly built an impregnable fortress.’

Steeling his resolve, Go Geom-wol urged his horse forward.

Just then, a woman approached Go Geom-wol.

The woman riding the pure white horse without a single stray hair was none other than Gu Mun-hye. As she came closer, Go Geom-wol’s gaze sank deeply.

Gu Mun-hye cautiously opened her mouth.

“I have something to tell you, Alliance Lord.”

“Does it have something to do with the Moon Shadow Six Fairies not being by your side?”

“…….”

“I thought so.”

Instantly, Gu Mun-hye’s face flushed red. She felt as if Go Geom-wol knew everything.

Gu Mun-hye bit her lip.

Go Geom-wol stared intently at Gu Mun-hye.

His indifferent gaze made her shoulders twitch. She wrapped both hands around her shoulders and continued.

“I… I acted arbitrarily with the remaining Moon Shadow Five Fairies and the martial artists of the Celestial Lunar Palace. I’m sorry.”

“The Celestial Lunar Palace is under your jurisdiction, so there’s no need to apologize. Instead, let’s hear the reason.”

“Lee… Gwak.”

“…….”

“I sent them to stop him. To hold him back, at least until the Celestial Demon Troupe subdues the Thousand Kingdom School.”

“You’ve done something unnecessary.”

Go Geom-wol let out a sigh.

He had already guessed, but hearing it from Gu Mun-hye’s mouth was even more disappointing.

For a moment, Gu Mun-hye tightly shut her eyes.

She would have preferred if he had gotten angry; his disappointed expression pained her heart. But she struggled to steady her resolve.

“I’m sorry. But I do not regret my decision.”

“He is already beyond your reach. I let the Endless Prison incident slide as unavoidable, but this decision of yours is truly disappointing.”

“Say what you will. It is my belief that for your sake, Alliance Lord, and the future of the Celestial Demon Troupe, he must be killed. I will gladly accept punishment later for acting arbitrarily and moving troops. But just this once, I wish you would trust my judgment.”

Gu Mun-hye’s voice was filled with desperation.

Go Geom-wol looked at Gu Mun-hye silently.

He could tell just by looking at her face that she had acted out of concern for him. But not all deeds done with good intentions lead to good results.

Gu Mun-hye had done this for him and the Celestial Demon Troupe, but the outcome would have to be seen.

After a long silence from Go Geom-wol, Gu Mun-hye made an impatient expression.

“Say something, please.”

“I think it’s best you step back for now.”

“What do you mean?”

“Go to the New Moon Manor.”

The New Moon Manor was a mountain retreat Go Geom-wol had prepared for Gu Mun-hye. It was a kind of safe house, and few within the Celestial Demon Troupe knew of its existence.

“Geom-wol!”

“Go to the New Moon Manor and reflect on your actions.”

At the unexpected words, Gu Mun-hye trembled as if struck by lightning.

Go Geom-wol looked at her with pitying eyes.

He knew well how devoted her feelings for him were. But there was a line that could be crossed, and a line that absolutely should not be crossed. She had crossed the line that should never be crossed.

Although she acted for Go Geom-wol’s sake in her own way, what she did only greatly disappointed him.

What Go Geom-wol wanted was, above all, a fair fight with Lee Gwak.

He had longed to meet Lee Gwak at the peak of the Jianghu, and now that day was nearing, Gu Mun-hye had interfered.

“G-Geomwol. I…….”

“I will not hear any objections. If you truly care for me, please leave like this.”

“I… understand.”

In the end, Gu Mun-hye gave up on making excuses.

Gu Mun-hye hung her head weakly.

Though tears weren’t flowing yet, her eyes were completely bloodshot.

Though her efforts to hold back tears looked pitiful, Go Geom-wol did not comfort her.

“Escort the Saintess to the New Moon Manor.”

“As you command.”

Martial artists who received Go Geom-wol’s order approached Gu Mun-hye.

Only then did Gu Mun-hye raise her head.

“I’m sorry for causing you trouble, Alliance Lord. I will accept your decision. I will await your judgment at the New Moon Manor.”

She engraved his features into her memory with burning eyes.

“Thank you. I will come for you in time.”

“I’ll wait… no matter how long.”

She turned away.

At last, the tears she had held back streamed down her cheeks.

‘I don’t regret it. Absolutely not….’

Gu Mun-hye muttered as if trying to brainwash herself.

Finally, she turned her head one last time to look at Go Geom-wol. But at that moment, Go Geom-wol was looking at the empty sky, not at her.

In the end, unable to see Go Geom-wol’s face, Gu Munhye turned her body away.

Go Geom-wol stared at the sky for a while.

If his subordinate’s voice hadn’t reached him then, he might have continued staring at the sky.

“A significant enemy force has been detected hiding ahead.”

“They are undoubtedly scouts from the Thousand Kingdom School.”

Though still far from the Sect, they had already run into the enemy.

At once, all the martial artists of the Celestial Demon Troupe turned to Go Geom-wol.

They waited only for Go Geom-wol’s command.

A thread of anticipation rose on the martial artists’ faces. And Go Geom-wol did not betray their expectations.

“From this moment, we begin the war with the Thousand Kingdom School.”

“Waaaah!”

The battle cry of the Celestial Demon Trouoe martial artists pierced the sky.

And so, the war that would decide the fate of the Jianghu and the Celestial Demon Troupe began.
