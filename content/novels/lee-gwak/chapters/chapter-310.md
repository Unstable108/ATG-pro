As Gyeong Un-cheon rose to his feet, an overwhelming presence like a mountain surged forward, enveloping Lee Gwak and his son.

He was like a colossal dragon.

The sheer force of his presence rendered Lee Cheong rigid, unable to move.

Just then, Lee Gwak stepped silently in front of Lee Cheong, and the crushing momentum vanished as though it had been washed away.

“Phew!”

Lee Cheong finally let out a breath of relief.

Even when directly confronting Gyeong Un-cheon’s immense pressure, Lee Gwak’s expression remained unchanged.

Gyeong Un-cheon’s lips curled in slight displeasure.

He didn’t like this situation at all.

The moment Lee Gwak entered the hall, he felt as though a sharply honed blade was pointing at his throat.

It was the first time he had ever felt such a sensation.

On the surface, Lee Gwak looked ordinary. But to someone as experienced as Gyeong Un-cheon, the hidden depth of Lee Gwak was somewhat visible.

Gyeong Un-cheon spoke.

“Why did you come to the Nine Dragons Clan, Lee Gwak?”

“I have no particular motive.”

“Do you really think I’d believe that?”

“I don’t mind if you don’t.”

“It doesn’t matter if you don’t.”

“You speak quite boldly. Does that mean you have confidence in your own martial prowess?”

Gyeong Un-cheon’s eyebrow twitched.

Over the years, he had met countless martial artists, yet none had dared display such insolence. That only made it all the more unpleasant.

He stared at Lee Gwak for a moment, then thought of a possibility.

‘Could it be?’

He promptly sent a telepathic message to Bu Yak-yeong, who was waiting outside.

-Search the room of these two, the young master of the Hao clan might be hiding there.

—Yes, sir!

With the message sent, Bu Yak-yeong’s presence vanished.

Lee Gwak noticed this. His eyes flickered slightly.

Gyeong Un-cheon continued, “I’ve heard rumors that there’s a rising martial artist in the world called ‘Sura blade’ who threatens the position of the Ten Lesser Skies. But now I see the rumors were off the mark. You’re far beyond the level of the so-called Ten Lesser Skies”

The internal art Gyeong Un-cheon practiced was called the Jade Heart Technique,which originated from the Wudang Sect. It had the unique ability to perceive the true nature of things.

When he saw the essence of Lee Gwak through the Jade Heart Technique, he couldn’t help but tremble.

Before recognising Lee Gwak’s presence, he had felt nothing at all. But the moment the Jade Heart Technique perceived Lee Gwak, he felt an astonishing, colossal power.

It felt as if an immense energy was packed tightly inside the shell known as Lee Gwak, compressed to its absolute limit.

Had it not been for the Jade Heart Technique, even he would not have been able to perceive Lee Gwak’s essence.

“What sect do you belong to?”

“Mad Martial Sect.”

“Mad Martial Sect?”

Surprise crossed Gyeong Un-cheon’s face.

Lee Cheong had mentioned during his duel that his sect was Mad Martial Sect, a name Gyeong Un-cheon had never heard before. After learning Lee Gwak’s true nature, he had assumed the “Mad Martial Sect” must be a lie.

He couldn’t believe that a sect he had never heard of could produce someone like Lee Gwak.

A hundred years after the Great Heavenly Blood War, the order of the Jianghu was solidified around the Ten Sects, and no sect could escape the eyes of the Ten Sects.

It was the same with the Nine Dragons Clan; Gyeong Un-cheon had never heard of a sect called the Mad Martial Sect before.

“Does the Mad Martial Sect truly exist?”

“I am its current sect master, and my child will succeed me.”

Gyeong Un-cheon’s gaze sharpened.

“Then who was the first sect master?”

Lee Gwak fell briefly silent, prompting a mocking voice from Gyeong Un-cheon.

“Why can’t you answer? Your master must be some public enemy of the Jianghu.”

Gyeong Un-cheon was sharp.

With a few words, he stabbed Lee Gwak like a dagger.

A look of conflict appeared on Lee Gwak’s face.

Revealing that his master was Gwang Noh-ya the ‘Lunatic Pugilist’ could bring more harm than good.

As the name suggests, Gwang Noh-ya was consumed by madness. Throughout his life, he had committed countless acts of madness. There were still many sects and martial artists in Jianghu who trembled at the mention of his name.

If Lee Gwak disclosed his master’s identity, he would likely have to shoulder all those grudges as well. For that reason, up until now, he had hesitated to reveal the truth.

Gyeong Un-cheon’s voice stabbed at his ears.

“What’s the matter? Don’t have the courage to name your master?”

All at once, Lee Gwak understood:

He couldn’t hide this forever.

With the official declaration of the name ‘Mad Martial Sect’, he would have to shoulder all the grudges and obligations associated with Gwang Noh-ya. And right now he had the strength to shoulder it all.

Lee Gwak stood upright, his shoulders squared, and declared, “My master is Gwang Noh-ya.”

“Lunatic Pugilist, Gwang Noh-ya?”

Gyeong Un-cheon’s voice trembled faintly.

To him—one of the Seven Sects and lord of the Nine Dragons Clan—Gwang Noh-ya was still a troublesome name.

The Lunatic Pugilist’s martial feats and eccentricities during his lifetime were incredible.

If Gwang Noh-ya were still alive, even Gyeong Un-cheon would find him a burden. But clearly, Lee Gwak said he was the current sect master.

Gwang Noh-ya, prone to bouts of insanity, would suffer periodic attacks that upended the martial world each time. Yet there had been no news of him for more than a decade.

He must have died. Otherwise, there was no way he would have stayed so quiet for so long. In that case, there was nothing to fear.

“A sect continuing the legacy of Lunatic Pugilist might as well be a public enemy. Can you really handle the legacy of such a madman?”

Lee Gwak calmly replied, “If not, I wouldn’t have revealed it.”

“Hmph! You have spirit, I’ll give you that. But the world isn’t as simple as you think.”

“It doesn’t need to be complicated.”

“You’re young and don’t understand how the world works. Jianghu isn’t so simple.”

“Perhaps it’s complicated because people like you make it so. Why insert so many schemes into a simple martial arts tournament?”

“You must want to die.”

Killing intent welled up around Gyeong Un-cheon.

The killing intent he radiated was so fierce that the very thought of confronting him was terrifying. But Lee Gwak didn’t even flinch and answered.

“I understand that you made a secret agreement with the Myriad Merchant Troupe and received gold bars. But I cannot comprehend why you would kidnap brother Woo Gyeong and try to poison him with the Heavenly Insect Poison. My master may have done many mad things, but he never resorted to such cowardly and despicable acts. Words like ‘public enemy of the martial Jianghu’ suit neither my master nor my sect; they fit Master Gyeong and the Nine Dragons Clan far better. I’ve heard that the founder of the Nine Dragons Clan was once a hero who struggled mightily to stop the Celestial Demon Troupe’s rampage. How could a descendant of such a hero be so cowardly and shameless? Aren’t you ashamed?”

Lee Gwak’s voice echoed throughout the hall.

He could not claim he was without a single shred of guilt in his lifetime, but at least he had nothing to be ashamed of before Gyeong Un-cheon. That’s why Lee Gwak stood proud.

He was confident in himself, which made Gyeong Un-cheon’s threats meaningless.

On the contrary, his resounding words pricked Gyeong Un-cheon’s pride.

“How dare you preach to me?”

Gyeong Un-cheon’s already fearsome aura grew even more menacing.

Torches and furniture inside the hall shook as if an earthquake had struck.

Thud!

“You mentioned Nam Woo-gyeong. So you’re the one who saved him.”

“That’s correct.”

“Then you’ve given me another reason not to let you live any longer.”

Gyeong Un-cheon’s eyes gleamed menacingly.

He reached out, and a sword hanging on the wall flew into his hand.

Engraved with a rising dragon, the sword was called the Dragon Form Sword, a prized weapon of the leader of the Nine Dragons Clan.

But Lee Gwak had no time to admire the Dragon Form Sword.

Shiiiing!

In an instant, Gyeong Un-cheon drew the sword and swung.

Clang!

Lee Gwak raised his blade to block Gyeong Un-cheon’s attack.

He was pushed backwards and Lee Cheong, who was standing behind him, was pushed back as well.

Had Lee Gwak not raised his blade in time, both he and his son would have been sliced in two by Gyeong Un-cheon’s sword.

Lee Gwak’s gaze turned cold.

He could tolerate an attack on himself, but not on his son.

Sssshk!

Drawing his blade, Lee Gwak spoke to Lee Cheong, “Don’t you dare step forward.”

“Yes, Dad.”

Lee Cheong nodded and stepped back.

Lee Gwak advanced toward Gyeong Un-cheon.

He didn’t want trouble, so he held back. That’s why he’d kept his identity hidden even when rescuing Nam Woo-gyeong. But now that everything was out in the open, there was no reason to hold back any longer.

At the sight of Lee Gwak walking confidently towards him, Gyeong Un-cheon’s eyes exploded with fury.

“Arrogant Bastard!”

Gyeong Un-cheon also walked towards Lee Gwak.

For decades, Gyeong Un-cheon had reigned as the undisputed leader of the region.

In all these years, no one dared to raise their head in front of him, whether they were old martial artists, young martial artists, or even those with considerable support behind them.

But now, a young martial artist, not even half his age, was walking toward him with his head held high. The sight ignited Gyeong Un-cheon’s nerves.

Until now, he had believed that his disciple, Eun Mu-yeong, was by far the greatest among the younger generation. Eun Mu-yeong’s martial aptitude was indeed extraordinary, and he also possessed a cruel, calculating mind, making him perfect for leading a mighty faction like the Nine Dragons Clan.

But at this moment, compared to Lee Gwak, even the talented Eun Mu-yeong seemed woefully lacking.

‘This level of martial skill at such a young age…’

A chill ran through his heart.

If he had not already made an enemy of him, it might have been a different story. But now that their relationship was hostile, he needed to eliminate Lee Gwak at all costs.

‘If I let him live, he’ll surely become a great threat in the future.’

While he was alive, it might not be a big problem, but if Eun Mu-yeong were to inherit the leadership of the Nine Dragons Clan in the future, Lee Gwak’s mere existence could spell disaster.

For the sake of Eun Mu-yeong and the Nine Dragons Clan, Lee Gwak had to be eliminated.

Whoosh!

Sensing its master’s intent, the Dragon-From Sword let out a murderous howl.

Gyeong Un-cheon’s nickname, the “Blood-Sea Divine Sword” , came not just from his ruthless methods, but also in large part from the power of this blade.

Sseeet!

The Dragon-From Sword sliced through space, flying toward Lee Gwak.

When the Dragon-From Sword collided with Lee Gwak’s blade, silver fragments flew in all directions.

That was the beginning.

Kagagagang!

The sound of their weapons clashing echoed violently throughout the grand hall.

“Ah!”

Lee Cheong looked on dumbfoundedly at the spectacle.

Their movements were so fast that Lee Cheong could barely capture them with his eyes.

Only vague afterimages streaked through the air, making it impossible to discern which was the real body.

Gyeong Un-cheon wielded the Iron Blood Soul Sword.

The Iron Blood Soul Sword had been created a hundred years earlier by Jin Mu-yeong, the founder of the Nine Dragons Clan, also known by the nickname “Peerless Sword”. He had distilled all his final insights into this absolute sword art at the end of his life.

The Iron Blood Soul Sword consisted of seven deadly moves, each filled with killing intent and earth-shaking power.

Shiiang!

Gyeong Un-cheon’s Iron Blood Soul Sword split the air with a clear sword aura, but it was blocked by Lee Gwak’s blade.

Chyeoong!

With a metallic sound, a sharp shockwave swept through the hall.

Ornaments and furnishings shattered, and the building itself trembled as if about to collapse. Even so, no one dared enter the hall; it was both a testament to their confidence in Gyeong Un-cheon and an expression of their fear.

Kakakakang!

Sparks flew in all directions as blade and sword clashed.

Under Gyeong Un-cheon’s overwhelming onslaught, Lee Gwak’s body lurched repeatedly, like a reed in a storm, precarious and ready to snap.

Yet although his body wavered, Lee Gwak’s gaze remained steady. His eyes were colder and more composed than ever.

Gyeong Un-cheon’s Iron Blood Soul Sword was truly fearsome. Had this occurred three years ago, even Lee Gwak would not have survived.

With the subtlety of his cultivation, the support of his powerful internal energy, and his enormous ambition, he lacked nothing.

It was a skill worthy of a sect master, and the title of Blood Sea Divine Sword was well deserved. But Lee Gwak felt no fear.

He had fought countless martial artists before.

He’d fought third-rate martial artists, the so-called Eight Great Martial Artists, and even Go Geom-wol in a fight for his life.

Especially, the fight with Go Geom-wol had greatly enhanced Lee Gwak’s capabilities. He had always trained in martial arts with Go Geom-wol as his enemy.

Gyeong Un-cheon was undoubtedly strong. But compared to Go Geom-wol, something was missing.

Sshiiit!

Lee Gwak’s blade cleaved through the air.

A sudden chill crawled over Gyeong Un-cheon, forcing him to retreat one step.

By a narrow margin, Lee Gwak’s blade grazed his shoulder, slicing through his clothes and skin. Blood flowed from the fresh wound, but Gyeong Un-cheon felt no pain.

It was the Heaven Killing Blade.

Sshit!

A demonic wail of breaking air resounded through the hall.

Gyeong Un-cheon’s face contorted.

With the Heaven Killing Blade, Lee Gwak was no longer the same as he had been moments ago.

It was as if a demon was wielding the blade.

Only then did Gyeong Un-cheon realize why Lee Gwak was called the “Sura Blade.”

Lee Gwak wasn’t just another common late-stage expert. He was an absolute master on par with Gyeong Un-cheon himself.

Sssiiit!

Lee Gwak’s blade struck with surgical precision.

The blade was raw, unadulterated by any blade aura or blade qi, but it was terrifyingly deadly.

It could not be cut by a sword aura, and no technique could block it. Gyeong Un-cheon had never encountered blade art like this before.

Kwaaang!

Their bodies smashed straight through the roof and emerged outside.

Both men landed on the roof of the great hall, staring each other down.

Gyeong Un-cheon caught his ragged breath and glared at Lee Gwak. Opposite him stood Lee Gwak, silently returning the gaze.

“That’s the Sect Master!”

“Who is that other person?”

Not only the martial artists guarding Gyeong Un-cheon’s residence, but also the martial artists who had not left after the martial arts tournament were excited to see them.

Gyeong Un-cheon’s quarters were the largest and most opulent building within the Nine Dragons Clan, so they naturally drew attention.

“What is going on? Who dares to challenge the Nine Dragons Clan Master within the Nine Dragons Clan itself?

“Is he mad?”

Confusion was etched on their faces.

The martial artists of Nine Dragons Clan hurriedly tried to send the crowd outside, but there were too many to expel everyone.

“What?”

Eun Mu-yeong, who arrived late, had a look of astonishment on his face.

To him, his master Gyeong Un-cheon was as high as the sky.

A sky so high that even stretching his hands, he could not reach it.

Because of that, Eun Mu-yeong had never even considered challenging or betraying his master.

Yet a young martial artist who appeared to be around his own age was now standing against that “sky.”

It was unimaginable to Eun Mu-yeong.

He grabbed a nearby martial artist and asked.

“Who is that guy, fighting with the master?”

“I don’t know either. Only that he’s a guest brought by the chief administrator…”

“What… Damn it!”

That was when it happened.

Just then—

After a brief pause, the two clashed again, and a shockwave swept the area.

“Kheuk!”

“Ah!”

Unprepared martial artists were swept away by the shockwave, tumbling in all directions.

Kang! Kaang!

The grand hall could not withstand the impact of their clash and crumbled.

People were shocked at the sight of the grand hall collapsing like a sandcastle.

It was hard to believe this was a duel between humans.

Chills ran down their bodies, and they involuntarily shivered.

Amidst the martial artists, someone muttered in awe.

“My goodness! To witness such a duel.”

Sseeeet!

As the thick cloud of dust split, the figures of the two emerged.

The moment the martial artists saw them, their eyes widened as if about to split.
