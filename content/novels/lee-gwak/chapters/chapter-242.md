Go Geom-wol suddenly raised his head and looked at the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Jin Woo-seon, who was sitting opposite him, asked. However, Go Geom-wol didn’t answer, his senses on high alert instead.

Jin Woo-seon and Je Mu-hyeok exchanged glances.

It was the first time they had seen such a reaction from Go Geom Wol, and it felt ominous.

Since coming to the Jade Heaven Alliance, Go Geom-wol had never once looked serious. Especially after meeting a martial artist named Lee Gwak, he had always worn a smile. But now, his face was gravely serious.

This expression felt unfamiliar.

Suddenly, Go Geom-wol stood up abruptly.

Jin Woo-seon tried to dissuade him. They were currently in the outer court, which was relatively easy to access, unlike the inner court. However, Go Geom-wol swiftly moved before Jin Woo-seon could stop him.

Jin Woo-seon watched Go Geom-wol’s departing figure with a helpless gaze.

At that moment, Je Mu-hyeok also stood up.

Je Mu-hyeok answered as if it was the most natural thing, then immediately followed Go Geom-wol.

Left alone, Jin Woo-seon’s expression twisted slightly, but he had no other choice.

Having been captivated by Go Geom-wol’s charisma during their time together, it wasn’t easy to let him go now.

Eventually, Jin Woo-seon propelled himself in the direction Go Geom-wol had taken.

Just as he was catching up to Go Geom-wol:

With a loud noise, something flew through the thick inner court wall.

Je Mu-hyeok and Jin Woo-seon’s expressions changed at the sudden event. But Go Geom Wol looked at the object that had flown through the wall with a deep gaze.

It was a person, bleeding from head to toe and writhing in pain.

“Impossible! Is that… the Green Forest Emperor, Po Cheon-wol?”

The elderly man struggling to stand, covered in blood, was indeed the Green Forest Emperor, Po Cheon-wol. As he wiped the blood dripping from his mouth, he looked beyond the shattered wall.

Heavy footsteps approached from inside the inner court.

Hearing the footsteps, Jin Woo-seon and Je Mu-hyeok’s expressions hardened. To those with less martial skill, it might have sounded like ordinary footsteps, but they could feel the immense force behind them.

They raised their internal energy in caution, bracing themselves for whoever was approaching from beyond the wall.

Finally, when the owner of the footsteps revealed himself, their shock reached its peak.

They blinked, momentarily unable to comprehend the situation unfolding before them.

Everyone knew Po Cheon-wol had come to attend the Heavenly Assembly at Jade Heaven Alliance. To see him now, barely standing and drenched in blood, and Ja Hong-cheon approaching with a cold killing intent, painted a clear picture.

There had been a confrontation between them, a fierce one at that, threatening each other’s lives.

“Ja Hong-cheon! How dare you…”

“That’s something we’ll have to see.”

Gritting his teeth, Po Cheon-wol gathered his qi.

His determination hadn’t wavered, but his legs were trembling. The internal injuries he had sustained from Ja Hong-cheon were severe.

Namgung Jin-geom arrived swiftly from the inner court. His condition wasn’t much different from Po Cheon-wol’s, with his clothes torn and wounds visible all over his body.

Namgung Jin-geom supported Po Cheon-wol.

The wounds Namgung Jin-geom had suffered were inflicted by others, not Ja Hong-cheon.

With sharp sounds cutting through the air, seventeen elders landed around Ja Hong-cheon.

Namgung Jin-geom clenched his teeth upon seeing the elders.

Standing guard around Ja Hong-cheon, these elders were the Jade Heaven Alliance’s most formidable fighters, the Heavenly Martial Squad.

The wounds Namgung Jin-geom had suffered came from battling them.

‘The Heavenly Martial Squad. The successors of the loyalists who followed the first Alliance Leader. They were this powerful.’

Each member of the Heavenly Martial Squad was indeed weaker than Namgung Jin-geom, but not by a significant margin. Moreover, there were seventeen of them.

No matter how strong Namgung Jin-geom was, facing all of them was an impossible task from the start.

Namgung Jin-geom’s gaze shifted to an elder standing beside Ja Hong-cheon, the group’s leader, Seok Pa-cheon.

“Wasn’t the Heavenly Martial Squad supposed to act only when the Jade Heaven Alliance faced a crisis?”

“Then their action constitutes a violation of the Jade Heaven Alliance’s laws.”

“The Alliance Leader convinced us.”

“He convinced us that the Jade Heaven Alliance is in a crisis. That continuing this way, we won’t even have a proper fight with the Celestial Demon Troupe and will face annihilation alongside the Ten Great Sects.”

Namgung Jin-geom’s eyes trembled, but Seok Pa-cheon continued regardless.

“Jianghu is not so vast. It’s nonsensical for the Ten Sects to divide and govern it. The Heavenly Martial Squad concluded that unifying the Jianghu is far better than facing the Celestial Demon Troupe.”

“Maybe we will. But it’s too late for regrets now. We’ve made our decision, and we’ll do our utmost to achieve the desired outcome.”

Namgung Jin-geom clenched his teeth.

The man he was supporting, Po Cheon-wol, looked as though he might shrug off his grip and storm out at any moment. However, Namgung Jin-geom used his internal energy to firmly hold him in place.

“I must decide my life or death with Ja Hong-cheon… Argh!”

Po Cheon-wol, struggling, suddenly flipped his eyes and fainted. Namgung Jin-geom had discreetly pressed on his acupoint.

Considering Po Cheon-wol’s level of martial arts, it was unbelievable that merely pressing an acupoint would put him to sleep, but it was possible because Namgung Jin-geom’s realm was comparable to Po Cheon-wol’s.

Namgung Jin-geom, carrying Po Cheon-wol on his shoulder, said,

“You yourself said you wouldn’t exclude us. Right?”

“That’s correct! Still, you have attended the Heavenly Assembly, so it’s true that I lack a justification.”

“We shall take our leave now. Will you let us go?”

Ja Hong-cheon, with his hands clasped behind his back, nodded slightly.

His entire being radiated an overwhelming aura.

Even Namgung Jin-geom, who considered himself among the top ten experts in the world, felt suffocated by it.

It was undeniably the aura of one who could dominate the world.

Namgung Jin-geom had to admit that Ja Hong-cheon was a much superior expert.

“Still, the Thousand Kingdom School and the Green Forest are lucky. You came in person. The other sects who sent their representatives won’t get off this lightly.”

“Go now, elder. Before I change my mind.”

Ja Hong-cheon wasn’t looking at Namgung Jin-geom. His gaze was already set elsewhere.

Namgung Jin-geom didn’t have the luxury to care whom Ja Hong-cheon was looking at. Before Ja Hong-cheon changed his mind, he had to leave the Jade Heaven Alliance with the people of Namgung Clan who had entered.

Namgung Jin-geom, with Po Cheon-wol on his shoulder, propelled himself away.

After their departure, Ja Hong-cheon spoke to Seok Pa-cheon.

“Old man, lead the Heavenly Martial Squad and proceed with the task.”

Seok Pa-cheon, along with the Heavenly Martial Squad, vanished, following Ja Hong-cheon’s command.

With that response, Seok Pa-cheon led the Heavenly Martial Squad away.

Once the Heavenly Martial Squad had departed, Ja Hong-cheon fixed his gaze piercingly on Go Geom-wol.

“I had not realized a dragon had entered my front yard. Who might you be?”

Go Geom-wol introduced himself with a formal bow.

A faint smile appeared on Ja Hong-cheon’s lips at that moment.

“I never expected to see the grand disciple of the Celestial Demon Troupe here. Have you been wandering the Jianghu?”

“I regret to inform you that your peaceful wandering ends today.”

“May I ask why? Weren’t the Ten Great Sects allies of the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

“In name only. In reality, they’re nothing more than nine parasites leeching off the Alliance.”

“Not at all. My words are merely the truth.”

“Don’t you think you’re diverting your forces to the wrong place when the Celestial Demon Troupe still thrives?”

“If you happen to return to the Celestial Demon Troupe, ask your master about it.”

“Have you made a secret pact with my master?”

Go Geom-wol’s eyes wavered at Ja Hong-cheon’s response.

‘Why would my master do such a thing?’

He couldn’t understand Jin Gwang-hon’s decision.

The Celestial Demon Troupe and Jade Heaven Alliance were never entities that could form a pact.

For the past hundred years, they had fought countless times, with many casualties on both sides. The blood they had shed hadn’t even dried yet, and now, a secret pact? It was a decision Go Geom-wol couldn’t comprehend.

Ja Hong-cheon’s gaze turned icy.

“Since you’ve come to the Alliance, I cannot simply let you go. How about leaving one arm behind? Your master should understand that much.”

“I am Ja Hong-cheon. There’s nothing impossible for me.”

“You underestimate me too much. Even my master couldn’t say that to me.”

“Even if you were, it would make no difference.”

“How audacious. Still, you’re better than my disciples. A man should have such spirit. The leader of the Celestial Demon Troupe is lucky to have a disciple like you.”

Ja Hong-cheon’s smile deepened.

A tremendous surge of qi swirled between them.

Jin Woo-seon was pushed back by the force they emitted.

It was as if he stood in the midst of a storm, his clothes wildly fluttering.

He stared blankly at Go Geom-wol.

‘My goodness! Go Geom-wol is the grand disciple of the Celestial Demon Troupe.’

At that moment, Ja Hong-cheon and Go Geom-wol clashed, sending thunderous roars throughout the Jade Heaven Alliance.

An unbelievable rumor struck Jianghu.

―The Jade Heaven Alliance has declared war on the Ten Great Sects.

When people first heard this rumor, they didn’t believe it.

In people’s minds, there was no reason for the Ten Great Sects to be at odds with each other. Thus, the rumor was dismissed as mere hearsay.

However, the subsequent rumors that emerged left people in turmoil.

―The supreme lord of the Thousand Kingdom School, Namgung Jin-geom, and the lord of Sky

High Castle, Po Cheon-wol, were seen leaving the Jade Heaven Alliance with injuries.

―The representatives sent by the Ten Great Sects to attend the Heavenly Assembly were either detained or killed.

Their impact was significantly greater, and they spread through the Jianghu much faster than the previous rumors. Testimonies from those who had escaped from the Jade Heaven Alliance began to surface.

―The Jade Heaven Alliance has been closed off.

―All the martial artists from the Ten Great Sects who entered the Jade Heaven Alliance were detained.

―The rumors are true. The Jade Heaven Alliance has declared war on the Ten Great Sects.

Now, it was impossible not to believe.

It was confirmed that the Jade Heaven Alliance had declared war on the Ten Great Sects.

The question was why the Jade Heaven Alliance turned against the Ten Great Sects. Opinions on this matter were divided.

Some said that Ja Hong-cheon had revealed his ambition, while others claimed it was because the Ten Great Sects had given him a reason to act. However, the truth was unknown to the martial artists.

One thing was certain: the peace the Jianghu had enjoyed was shattered, and an era of chaos had dawned.

The one who brought about this chaos was the very master of Jade Heaven Alliance, whom they had relied on. And so, the world was plunged into uncontrollable turmoil.

People trembled in fear, and the Ten Great Sects began to mobilize hastily in response to the unexpected declaration of war from the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Thus, the winds of a turbulent era began to blow.
