“Brother, that was incredible”

As Lee Gwak descended Mount Wudang, Lim Ji-moon suddenly appeared and gave him a thumbs-up.

“You saw it?”

“Of course. I watched everything from start to finish. You were incredible. Though the appearance of that old Taoist might have taken away a bit of the show, the outcome couldn’t have been better.”

“Then I’m glad.”

“I had no idea Wudang had such a powerful elder. that. Wow! If I hadn’t known, I might’ve been caught off guard later.”

“That’s the strength of a prestigious orthodox sect. The longer their history, the more masters lie hidden in the shadows. That’s what makes them so formidable.”

“If the Wudang Sect is like this, I’m afraid of what will happen if Mount Hua or the Shaolin Sect were to return to the world.”

“Exactly.”

“I’ve booked us a place in Sipyeon. Let’s stay there tonight and leave tomorrow.”

“Sounds good.”

The two chatted casually as they made their way down Mount Wudang.

Having achieved their goal, they appeared noticeably more relaxed.

They wanted to relax and enjoy a drink.

‘Wonder if Brother Oh Jung-gyeong and Nam Woo-gyeong are still in Sipyeon.’

As he made his way down, he hoped at least one of them was still there.

It didn’t take long to reach Sipyeon.

As soon as he arrived, Lee Gwak asked around for Oh Jung-gyeong and Nam Woo-gyeong.

Nam Woo-gyeong seemed to have already left, but fortunately, Oh Jung-gyeong and the Jeongong Escort Agency were still in town.

“Haha! My friend!”

As Lee Gwak entered the inn, Oh Jung-gyeong greeted him with open arms.

“You’re still here.”

“How could I leave when you went up to Mount Wudang? I stayed behind so you wouldn’t have to drink alone when you came down.”

In fact, this wasn’t even the inn where the Jeongong Escort Agency was staying.

Oh Jung-gyeong had booked a different place just to wait for Lee Gwak, knowing he disliked unnecessary trouble.

“That really touches me.”

“If you’re grateful, you can pay for the drinks.”

“Hmph!”

Lee Gwak chuckled at Oh Jung-gyeong’s playful remark.

Despite his words, he had already set out a table full of food and drinks, knowing Lee Gwak would come back.

Lim Ji-moon clapped his hands and took a seat.

“What are you waiting for? The food’s getting cold.”

Lee Gwak and Oh Jung-gyeong smiled and sat across from him.

Oh Jung-gyeong poured Lee Gwak a drink and said,

“You’ve done well. A total victory over the First Sword of Wudang—it’s hard to fathom.”

“Word has already reached you?”

“News travels faster than footsteps. The rumor of your victory over Taoist Jinghae is already spreading throughout Sipyeon.”

“That’s terrifying!”

“People pay extra attention to those with great reputations like yours. Even the smallest things you do quickly become known.”

“That’s inconvenient.”

“What can you do? It’s the fate of the famous.”

Oh Joong-gyeong looked at Lee Gwak with pity.

Though they hadn’t been friends for long, he understood Lee Gwak’s character and personality better than anyone.

Lee Gwak had never sought fame, nor did he want to lead others. He just wanted to live quietly with his family.

But now, he had to act against his nature—and Oh Jung-gyeong couldn’t help but feel sympathy. Still, it was something Lee Gwak had to bear.

Oh Jung-gyeong downed his drink.

Setting down his cup, he asked,

“What will you do now?”

“First, I plan to return to the Mad Martial Sect.”

“You seem concerned.”

“As the sect leader, it’s only natural.”

“True…”

Oh Jung-gyeong nodded.

He was in a leadership position himself, so he understood how Lee Gwak felt. With sect’s the foundation still unstable, it was inevitable to feel anxious.

This time, Lee Gwak asked Oh Jung-gyeong,

“What about you?”

“A nearby merchant group submitted a request. It’s near the area where my agency is based, so I’m planning to accept.”

“That’s great.”

“It’s rare for things to line up this perfectly. Guess I got lucky.”

Usually, escort agencies either return empty-handed or have to make long detours. Getting a job on the way back, especially one near their base, was a stroke of luck.

Oh Jung-gyeong raised his cup with a laugh.

“Hahaha! Ever since meeting you, things have been going smoothly. You must be my lucky charm.”

“Glad to hear it!”

Lee Gwak also smiled and raised his cup.

With the Wudang Sect matter resolved, he felt refreshed.

If things had gone wrong and Wudang had become an enemy, the consequences would have been severe. But with that settled, he could now focus on the Mad Martial Sect’s internal affairs.

Though Lim Sobo was managing things exceptionally well and hardly needed Lee Gwak’s intervention, the sect leader’s presence still made a big difference.

“No need to worry too much.”

Lim Ji-mun, sensing Lee Gwak’s thoughts, suddenly spoke up.

When Lee Gwak looked at him with a puzzled expression, Lim Ji-mun tore into a piece of meat and said,

“This is delicious. What I mean is even if you don’t return right away, the sect will run just fine. Even a nine-tailed fox can’t compare to sister. She’s probably pouring everything she planned into the Mad Martial Sect right now. No need to rush back.”

“Hmm.”

Lee Gwak nodded.

Lim Sobo was channeling all the talents she couldn’t display at Sky High Castle into the Mad Martial Sect.

Thanks to her, the Mad Martial Sect was evolving by the day.

Shaking a bottle, Im Ji-moon grinned.

“Bottom line—no need to hurry back. Let’s take it slow, enjoy the sights, and drink plenty of good liquor.”

His face was already red.

He’d already downed an entire bottle while eating.

Lee Gwak shook his head helplessly. Oh Jung-gyeong did the same, clearly exasperated.

Still, Lee Gwak didn’t fault him.

Even if it seemed like Lim Ji-mun spent his days drinking and slacking off, he always got his work done.

He had long finished everything Lim So-bo had assigned.

And now with the Wudang Sect matter resolved, today was a day to relax and drink.

A gentle smile touched Lee Gwak’s lips.

It was a good time.

As he enjoyed this rare moment of leisure, thoughts of Han So-cheon and the children surfaced in his mind.

‘I hope they’re doing well.’

No news was good news, and the lack of updates meant they were safe. Still, as a human, Lee Gwak couldn’t help but miss his family.

Gulp.

Lee Gwak quietly emptied his cup.

Time passed quickly.

Though it didn’t feel like he drank much, empty bottles were now piled high on the table.

Lim Ji-mun took a bottle and went to his room. Oh Jung-gyeong excused himself, saying he was tired.

Only Lee Gwak was left sitting alone, staring out the window.

Now that Wudang’s open gathering was over, Sipyeon had returned to its usual calm.

There were still a few martial artists around, but the streets were far less crowded than before, making the night peaceful for contemplation.

Drip.

As Lee Gwak refilled his empty cup—

Creak.

The inn’s door suddenly opened, and someone entered.

Lee Gwak didn’t care who it was.

But the person’s headed straight for him.

Lee Gwak’s brow furrowed slightly.

With the whole inn empty, approaching his table could only mean one thing—this person had come with intent.

Whoosh.

As the figure drew closer, a fragrant scent filled the air.

It was sweet and extravagant, reminiscent of roses.

Lee Gwak’s eyes wavered slightly.

The scent was familiar.

Long ago, when he was a young martial artist, he had known a woman who smelled the same way.

Only she carried it.

‘No way…’

Lee Gwak lifted his head.

And the moment he saw the woman’s face, his eyes trembled.

“Yul…seon, how…?”

Large, dewy eyes, a delicate nose, and small lips stood out in contrast against her snow-white skin and dark hair.

The woman, as dazzling as a rose, was none other than Geum Yul-seon.

Long ago, when Lee Gwak was still part of the Jade Heaven Alliance, they had been lovers. But after years of devotion, she abandoned him to become the lover of the alliance’s first young master, Yong Cheon-myeong.

From that day, Lee Gwak had erased her from his heart.

And now, this woman from his distant past stood before him in the very inn he was staying at.

Even a man as composed and logical as Lee Gwak couldn’t help but feel shaken.

Geum Yul-seon stared at him for a moment before speaking.

“It’s been a long time, oppa.”

“Yul-seon!”

“You look well. Mind if I sit?”

“…”

Though Lee Gwak didn’t answer, she sat down without hesitation.

Though time had left its mark, she was still beautiful.

Her porcelain skin and soft voice—unchanged from the past—were enough to unsettle him.

As the most renowned courtesan of Musical Performance Hall

, her voice had a mesmerizing quality.

Lee Gwak’s gaze darkened.

“How did you get here?”

“You don’t seem happy to see me after so long.”

“Yul-seon!”

“I know you resented me. But back then, I had no choice. You understand, don’t you?”

“……”

“You still don’t understand, do you?”

“I asked how you ended up here.”

“I was part of the Jade Heaven Alliance’s delegation.”

“You were?”

“What, surprised?”

Geum Yul-seon stared intently at Lee Gwak.

Her eyes held a whirlwind of emotions: resentment, longing, sorrow, and anger.

Lee Gwak was the man who had killed her husband, Yong Cheon-myeong.

Although Yong Cheon-myeong had grown cold and begun to distance himself from her in recent times, he was still her one and only husband.

When she first heard the news of his death, it felt as though the sky had collapsed. And when she learned that the one who had killed him was Lee Gwak, despair consumed her.

But Geum Yul-seon also understood.

She knew all too well that abandoning Lee Gwak for Yong Cheon-myeong had been an unforgivable act.

But back then, she saw no future with Lee Gwak.

Marrying him might have brought temporary happiness, but it would never have lifted her out of hardship. So, she had no choice but to hesitate.

And then, Yong Cheon-myeong had approached her.

His handsome face, masculine demeanor, and—most importantly—his status as the likely next leader of the Changcheon Alliance had won her over.

In the end, she had abandoned Lee Gwak and chosen Yong Cheon-myeong.

No matter how it had happened, Geum Yul-seon had chosen Yong Cheon-myeong as her husband and had relied on him ever since.

Even when Yong Cheon-myeong’s affection faded and his treatment grew cold, her heart never wavered.

Now, she asked Lee Gwak:

“Oppa, why did you do it? Did you really have to kill him so cruelly? Did you hate me that much?”

“I never resented you.”

“Liar! You resented me, so you took it out on my husband. Isn’t that right?”

“Yul-seon! I fought Yong Cheon-myeong because our positions were different. Killing him was an unavoidable outcome of settling the fight. I regret his death, but there was no trace of personal resentment or hatred toward you in it. To me, you are like a river that has already flowed away—something that can never return.”

Geum Yul-seon’s eyebrows trembled slightly, as if she hadn’t expected Lee Gwak to be so decisive.

Even though she had been the one to abandon him, she had still hoped Lee Gwak would remember her.

She didn’t care if that made her selfish.

She didn’t expect anyone to understand her feelings.

Biting her lip, she said,

“You’ve changed. You weren’t like this before.”

“A lot of time has passed.”

Unlike Geum Yul-seon, whose emotions were in turmoil, Lee Gwak’s expression remained calm.

Seeing her now, he felt nothing.

Too much time had passed, and now, he had a loving family of his own.

Thud.

Lee Gwak set down the cup he had been holding.

There was no trace of drunkenness left in his face.

“Why are you here, Yul-seon?”

His voice was cold, devoid of any lingering emotion, sending an inexplicable chill down her spine. But it lasted only a moment before her own expression frosted over.

She answered,

“I have come for revenge.”
