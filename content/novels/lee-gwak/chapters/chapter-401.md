Squeak! Squeak!

The sound of creaking oars echoed along the misty river.

Soon, a small boat appeared, moving through the thick fog. When the boat reached the shore, two men stepped off. The boatman bowed deeply to the two men in farewell.

“Please, take care on your journey, Sect Master! Young Master!”

“Thank you.”

“Be careful on your way back.”

The two men who had gotten off the boat were Lee Gwak and Lim Jimun.

Their faces were noticeably pale.

It was because they had spent all their strength setting up the Six Direction Iron Wall Formation over the past two months.

Setting up the Six Direction Iron Wall Formation wasn’t easy. If even one of the seven formations or twelve mechanisms was placed wrong, the whole setup would fail, and they’d have to start over from the beginning.

Lim Jimun was an expert in formations, while Lee Gwak was highly skilled with mechanisms. Each was a master in his own field, but combining the two together was a whole different challenge.

The arrays and mechanisms had to harmonize perfectly, interlocking like gears without the slightest gap.

Only when they moved organically, like a living organism, could the Six Direction Iron Wall Formation be considered complete.

Together with Lim Sobo, they had spent two intense months completing it.

Finally, just a few days ago, they managed to finish the setup.

Now that the formation was complete, there was no sect in the region that could threaten the Mad Martial Sect.

The Nine Dragons Clan had been the most likely contender, but they were too caught up in internal strife with the Hao Clan to focus on outside affairs. Moreover, the Wudang Sect’s opening ceremony was a major event for them as well.

After all, the founder of Nine Dragons Clan had been from the Wudang Sect.

Historically, the two sects had maintained strong ties, so regardless of their current troubles, Nine Dragons Clan could not afford to ignore the Wudang Sect.

Only after confirming the safety of the Mad Martial Sect did Lee Gwak finally set out for Wudang. Lim Ji-Mun accompanying him was unexpected.

Now that the Six Direction Iron Wall Formation was complete, Lim Ji-Mun felt there wasn’t much left for him to do at the sect, so he decided it would be better to travel to the Wudang Sect with Lee Gwak.

Lim Sobo agreed, hoping he would assess the situation at Wudang Sect with a clear mind.

And so, half by choice and half by duty, Lim Ji-Mun set off with Lee Gwak.

Having been apart for so long, some awkwardness was inevitable between. But after working side by side daily to set up the formation, they had grown much closer.

Lim Ji-Mun asked,

“Wouldn’t it be better to travel by land to reach Wudang?”

“Most likely…”

“Time is short, so we’ll have to stay on the move.”

Setting up the formation had taken up most of their time, and with Wudang still far away, they didn’t have much left to spare. Still, neither of them seemed too concerned.

Both were martial artists, and if needed, they could use their qigong to move quickly.

“Did you pack everything?”

“Of course.”

Lim Jimun grinned and glanced at the bundle on his back.

This was, after all, the Opening Ceremony of the Wudang Sect—one of the Nine Great Sects.

They couldn’t attend such a momentous event empty-handed.

Even a modest gift was necessary.

Inside Lim Jimun’s bundle were gifts prepared by Lim Sobo, not excessive, but certainly appropriate.

The two continued chatting as they walked.

“I still can’t believe it, you know. Back when I was with the Jade Heaven Alliance, I never imagined you would become the leader of a sect—and that I’d end up joining it, too.”

“Neither did I.”

“Life sure is unpredictable. After Master passed away like that, who would have thought you’d take his place?”

“Indeed.”

“Honestly, before I came here, I was half in doubt. But after seeing you in action, I’m convinced now. You’re going to do great.”

Admiration filled Lim Jimun’s eyes.

He had known Lee Gwak since his insignificant days, and yet there wasn’t a trace of contempt in his gaze.

Instead, he celebrated Lee Gwak’s success wholeheartedly.

Seeing this, Lee Gwak said,

“I’m still lacking in so many ways to lead a sect. But I’ll work hard. Please stay by my side and support me.”

“Don’t worry. I’ll do everything I can.”

“Thank you.”

“No need for thanks. Hehe!”

Lim Ji-Mun’s bright smile held no shadow of darkness. Seeing this, Lee Gwak smiled as well.

The two continued to talk for a long time after that.

Almost two days passed like this.

Both of them were martial artists, so they didn’t feel much fatigue from the journey.

Eventually, they reached a place called Yeolha, meaning ‘Warm River’—a region where the river never froze, even in winter.

Yeolha was surrounded by mountains, which kept it warm in winter and cool in summer. Thanks to these natural advantages, it had once served as the capital of the ancient Xia Dynasty.

The Xia Dynasty had fallen long ago, but its traces were still there. Even now, many people visit Yeolha to see the relics of the past, and the ruins were vast and impressive.

Since it was both their first time visiting Yeolha, everything felt fresh and fascinating.

They would have liked to stay longer and look around, but now was not the time for sightseeing, so they suppressed their regret.

After asking around, they found the horse market—riding would be faster for reaching Wudang.

Fortunately, Yeolha had a large horse market. They chose suitable horses and completed their purchase.

Next, they headed to an inn.

They weren’t exactly exhausted, but after two nights sleeping on the ground, a warm bed sounded heavenly.

Luckily, there was a decent place to stay not too far from the market. The two men left their horses with the innkeeper and booked a room.

After a quick wash at the well behind the inn, Lee Gwak came to the dining room.

“Brother!”

Lim Jimun was already waiting at a table with food and wine. He’d washed up quickly and ordered first.

Lee Gwak smiled and sat across from him, Lim Ji-Mun promptly filled his cup.

“You must be thirsty. Drink up”

“Thanks.”

As Lee Gwak raised his cup, Lim Ji-Mun clinked his cup against it.

Clink!

A clear sound rang out.

After taking a sip, Lee Gwak’s eyes widened. The wine tasted better than he had expected.

“Tastes great, doesn’t it? I was surprised too.”

“This is no ordinary wine.”

“I asked the innkeeper. The brewery that supplies this place has been around for nearly three hundred years.”

“Impressive. That’s truly a heritage worth boasting about.”

“Right? I’m planning to buy a few bottles before we leave. That’s okay, right?”

“Of course!”

Lee Gwak nodded willingly.

Finding such a perfect wine was rare. Every region had its specialties, bbut even a devoted drinker couldn’t possibly sample them all.

“We should see if they can supply the Mad Martial Sect.”

“Considering it’s just two days’ journey from here, it should be possible if things work out.”

“Once we get back, I’ll have Sobo look into it.”

“I can handle that myself. I’ll visit the brewery later today.”

“Won’t it be a hassle?”

“Not at all! How could I pass up visiting a place that makes such delicious wine?”

Lim Jimun chuckled happily.

Although it wasn’t widely known yet, his nickname was the Jade Face Drunken Dragon.

He was so handsome that many women across the Jianghu had fallen for him. Yet, what he loved most was good alcohol.

For a good drink, he wouldn’t hesitate to travel to the ends of the earth. Hence, the nickname.

“Hehe! This is wonderful. Worth a fortune!”

Lim Jimun wore a delighted smile.

Lee Gwak chuckled as he watched him.

He had known Lim Jimun since he was a small boy, and now that little kid had grown into a fine young man—and a wine lover, no less.

Lee Gwak took another sip.

The rich aroma of the wine filled his senses.

Just the fragrance alone seemed to wash away all his fatigue.

Clack!

As he emptied his cup and placed it back on the table—

Crash!

Suddenly, a commotion erupted outside.

“What’s going on?”

Lim Ji-Mun frowned and opened the window. Outside, a cart loaded with wine jars stood before the inn, with a young man lying on the ground. Five large, imposing men stood over him.”

The coldest-eyed among them crouched and patted the fallen man’s cheek.

“Still stubborn after all this?”

“Guh!”

“Resisting is pointless. Hand it over, and we’ll manage it well.”

“The Yeon Family Brewery has been run by my family for generations. How could I hand it over to outsiders?”

The fallen man gritted his teeth and glared at him.

At first glance, he looked delicate, but his firm gaze and tightly sealed lips revealed his strong spirit.

Despite facing overwhelming odds, he showed no signs of fear.

The leader of the five thugs smirked in disbelief.

“Hey! Do you even know who we are? Do you know who’s backing us?”

“That’s…”

“It’s the Mad Martial Sect. Heard of it?”

His voice rose sharply.

The sound echoed throughout the area.

The bystanders flinched at the sudden mention of the name.

“The Mad Martial Sect? Really?”

A look of bewilderment flashed across their faces, and then the leader spoke with a smug smile.

You know who took down the Heavenly Fate Sect, right? They’re just getting settled now, but soon they’ll officially expand. And then—this whole region will be under the Mad Martial Sect’s control.”

The crowd fell silent.

While the Mad Martial Sect wasn’t yet famous in the wider Jianghu, locals knew them well—they were the ones who had crushed the oppressive Heavenly Fate Sect.

(‘Those bastards are using the Mad Martial Sect’s name?’)

(‘So the Mad Martial Sect is no better than the Heavenly Fate Sect.’)

The five men threatening the Yeon Family Brewery were notorious thugs known throughout the region.

The leader’s name was Eon Yu-sang. Rumor had it that he was a descendant of the Jinju Eon family, which had been exterminated long ago.

When the Heavenly Fate Sect rose to power, Eon Yu-sang sided with them and committed all sorts of atrocities. After the Heavenly Fate Sect was crushed by Lee Gwak and the Mad Martial Sect, he briefly disappeared, only to resurface recently. Now, he was running rampant again, claiming that the Mad Martial Sect was backing him.

The Yeon Family Brewery, which Eon Yu-sang had his eyes on, was the oldest brewery in the region.

The brewery, which had preserved its legacy for generations, had recently built a strong reputation by supplying high-quality liquor to the nearby inns. The key reason for this rise was the young master who personally handled the deliveries.

The man collapsed in front of the cart was none other than that young master, Yeon Gyeong-san.

Yeon Gyeong-san had come to deliver liquor to an inn but ended up in trouble after running into Eon Yu-sang and his gang.

Eon Yu-sang grabbed Yeon Gyeong-san by the collar and yanked him up.

Yeon Gyeong-san’s frail body swayed helplessly.

Eon Yu-sang pulled Yeon Gyeong-san’s face close to his own and spoke.

“Stop being stubborn and hand over the Yeon Family Brewery.”

“I’ve already told you—I can’t give up my family’s business.”

“Tch! You little bastard! I tried to be nice, but you’re leaving me no choice. You dare defy the name of Mad Martial Sect?”

“P-please… Let me speak to your sect leader.”

“You think someone like the sect leader would waste time on a nobody like you? He doesn’t even need to lift a finger. I could crush a brewer like you with just one.”

“Isn’t the Mad Martial Sect supposed to be a righteous sect?”

Yeon Gyeong-san raised his voice.

He had believed that the Mad Martial Sect would be different – after all, they had eradicated the corrupt Heavenly Fate Sect that had plagued the region. That’s why this betrayal hurt even more.

Eon Yu-sang looked amused.

“Are you insulting the Mad Martial Sect in front of me right now? Sounds like I need to cut off your damn hand to make you understand.”

Shring!

He drew a dagger from his belt.

He really wanted to cut off Yeon Gyeong-san’s wrist. If he did that, no one in Yeolha would dare to defy him again.

“Heh heh!”

Eon Yu-sang’s men grabbed Yeon Gyeong-san’s arm. Although he struggled, he had no chance against their brute strength.

“Aaah!”

Yeon Gyeong-san’s eyes trembled with fear.

If his arm were cut off, he would never be able to brew liquor again.

Just as despair filled his eyes—

“Everyone, stop right there!”

A clear, resonant voice rang out.

Annoyed, Eon Yu-sang’s gang turned toward the source of the voice.

“Who the hell are you?!”

Standing where their gazes fell was a young man.

He replied,

“Someone from the Mad Martial Sect.”
