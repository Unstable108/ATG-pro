“Since there are no seats available, may we join you for a bit?”

With Bang Ye-in’s cheerful consent, Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo took their seats.

Already, several dishes had been served at her table.

“These are the most famous dishes from Paradise Inn. Try some, brother.”

“It seems like the amount might be too little for us to share.”

“It would hardly suffice for a bear.”

The word ‘bear’ made Bang Ye-in immediately understand.

Her gaze shifted to Cheol Gwang Woo, who sat awkwardly beside Lee Gwak, his face turning even redder.

“Haha! No, please eat to your heart’s content. Paradise Inn is especially famous for its water-boiled fish. I came here specifically for it.”

“Should we order the water-boiled fish then?”

“Twice-cooked pork is delicious too, and spicy tofu is exceptional. Mmm, Fish-flavored shredded pork is also worth trying, and then…”

From Bang Ye-in’s small mouth flowed a stream of names for dishes that Cheol Gwang Woo had neither heard nor seen before.

Cheol Gwang Woo listened, utterly captivated by her list.

Even after Bang Ye-in finished, Cheol Gwang Woo struggled to regain his composure. It was her voice that snapped him back to reality.

“I, I mean, let’s order all of them.”

Bang Ye-in chuckled at Cheol Gwang Woo’s flustered reply. Unable to properly look at her face, he called a server to place their order.

The server, shocked by the enormous order, gaped before quickly understanding upon seeing Cheol Gwang Woo’s massive frame.

Bang Ye-in’s gaze then shifted to Lee Gwak.

“What happened? I was puzzled hearing your name spread across Jianghu, knowing you were presumed dead six years ago.”

“Really? You must have been very fortunate.”

Bang Ye-in examined Lee Gwak with an intrigued expression.

Lee Gwak felt somewhat tickled by her scrutinizing gaze. Bang Ye-in didn’t hide her curiosity.

“Anyway, it’s good to see you again. I never dreamed I’d meet you here.”

“Weren’t you at the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

“I have some business that takes me to Seize Fortress.”

“I have an acquaintance there.” Lee Gwak continued

“Do you mean the leader of the Shadowless Squad?”

“That’s right. How did you know?”

“After the war ended, he refused to return due to his hatred for the Celestial Demon Troupe and stayed put in Seize Fortress. Of course, that’s not my words, but what Big Bear from Seize Fortress said.”

He had met Big Bear in Seize Fortress, whose real name was Cheol Dae-San, but Bang Ye-in preferred to call him by his nickname.

Suddenly, Bang Ye-in looked at Cheol Gwang Woo as if she remembered something.

“Now that I think about it, it’s the first time I’ve seen someone bigger than Big Bear. Wow!”

Her spontaneous exclamation made Cheol Gwang Woo’s face turn red again.

This time, Lee Gwak posed a question.

“But where are you headed? Are you also heading to the Seize Fortress?”

“My direction is similar, but I don’t specifically aim for Seize Fortress.”

“I have a sister I’m trying to find. She’s been hard to locate because she doesn’t stay in one place for long.”

“Must be someone close to you.”

“Well, we were quite close as children. Our families were close, so we grew up together. It would have been nicer if she didn’t insist on practicing acupuncture on me every other day under the guise of medical research…”

“Indeed, she’s a descendant of the Divine Physician.”

Lee Gwak tilted his head at the unfamiliar term.

“It’s understandable you don’t know. It’s a name forgotten by the world now. The Divine Physician was a legendary physician who lived a hundred years ago, known for saving anyone who wasn’t already dead, no matter how grave their injuries.”

Seeing Lee Gwak’s puzzled look, Bang Ye-in looked around carefully to make sure no one was listening, then whispered quietly,

“The Divine Physician was the lover of the Fist Demon who ended the Great Heavenly Blood War. Thanks to her care, the Fist Demon fought without fearing injuries.”

“Then, the descendants of the Fist Demon and the Divine Physician still exist?”

“Yes. My sister is the only descendant of both, a physician so skilled she could rightfully be called the Divine Physician of our times.”

“Why hasn’t someone so remarkable been known in the Jianghu?”

Lee Gwak showed his inability to comprehend.

As Bang Ye-in described, such an accomplished healer should have been renowned in the Jianghu, yet Lee Gwak had never heard of her.

“She doesn’t want her name to be known. Wandering to heal the sick, tracking her movements is no easy task.”

“How do you plan to find such an elusive person?”

“Heh! There’s been a sighting of her near Leshan.”

“Lishan? Near the Hua Mountain?”

“Yes. Considering the Fist Demon’s sect was the Mount Hua Sect, it’s not impossible she settled there.”

Lee Gwak found Bang Ye-in’s story plausible but didn’t show much interest.

Though the title of Divine Physician sounded impressive, it didn’t concern him much.

“Do you have a particular reason you must find her?”

“Both my sister and I have a tendency to wander. It’s been a long time since we last saw each other, so I suddenly wanted to see her. Now that I’ve heard where she might be, how could I not try to find her? Wouldn’t you do the same, Oraboni?”

“If I were in your shoes, I suppose I would.”

As they were speaking, the server brought a tray full of dishes to their table.

The table was soon overflowing with food, making Cheol Gwang Woo’s eyes widen and his nose twitch.

The aroma wafting from the dishes nearly made Cheol Gwang Woo dizzy with hunger.

With Lee Gwak’s permission, Cheol Gwang Woo began to eagerly devour the food.

Seeing Cheol Gwang Woo nearly moved to tears by the taste, Bang Ye-in couldn’t help but let out a giggle.

“Don’t worry, I won’t steal any from you. Take your time. Start with the water-boiled fish here. Unlike other dishes, the fish is boiled before being cooked, making its flavor delicate. Eating the milder dishes before the spicier ones allows you to truly appreciate each dish’s taste.”

Bang Ye-in personally served some of the water-boiled fish onto Cheol Gwang Woo’s plate.

Following her advice, Cheol Gwang Woo tasted the dishes in the recommended order, and it seemed to enhance their flavors even more.

A natural exclamation escaped Cheol Gwang Woo’s mouth.

“It’s really good, right? This is the first inn I’ve found that rivals the Bang Clan’s Inn. I discovered the chef here trains diligently. I thought the Bang Clan’s Inn was unbeatable, but the world is wide, and there are many masters. I need to train harder, too.”

Watching Cheol Gwang Woo enjoy the food inspired Bang Ye-in.

Lee Gwak also sampled a few bites and internally marveled at the quality. Yibin’s reputation for having the tastiest inn was well deserved.

“Impressive. What level of dedication is required to achieve such flavors?”

As Bang Ye-in said, the world is wide, and there are many hidden masters, not only among chefs but also among martial artists.

Currently, the Jianghu was abuzz with names like the Ten Great Sects and the Ten Lesser Skies, but how many reclusive experts could there be?’

Even Bang Ye-in’s martial arts prowess was noteworthy, and if the Divine Physician was a descendant of the Fist Demon, then her martial skills must also be exceptional.

It was daunting to imagine how many such skilled individuals were hidden within the Jianghu.

“Complacency is a sin; only continual progress can ensure survival in the treacherous Jianghu.”

Lee Gwak gained an unexpected insight in an unlikely place.

Then Bang Ye-in asked Lee Gwak,

“Oraboni, will you be passing through Xichang on your way to the Seize Fortress?”

“That would be the quickest route.”

“That’s perfect. Then I can accompany you as far as Xichang. I plan to head north from there to Lishan.”

Lee Gwak readily agreed to Bang Ye-in’s suggestion, much to the delight of Cheol Gwang Woo beside him.

Bang Ye-in smiled subtly at Cheol Gwang Woo’s enthusiasm.

The Wild Wolf Squad rode their horses swiftly.

They were accustomed to living on horseback, like martial artists of the central plains. Sometimes, they spent the entire day without dismounting, even eating and sleeping on their horses.

But this lifestyle proved to be a harsh trial for Lee Soo-ah.

Despite having more stamina than her peers due to her martial arts training, spending the whole day on horseback was extremely taxing for her.

Her muscles ached, and her joints creaked.

Yet, Lee Soo-ah never whined or cried about her suffering.

She clenched her small lips tightly, bearing the pain in silence.

‘The pain I’m feeling is nothing compared to what Lee Cheong is enduring. He faces far greater agony every single day.’

Thinking of Lee Cheong strangely made her own pain fade away. Well, the pain was still there, but it felt numb.

One benefit of traveling all day with the Wild Wolf Squad was that the pursuers trailing Lee Cheong found it difficult to keep up.

The pursuers likely didn’t anticipate the squad’s skill in horseback riding. Such horsemanship was beyond those not specifically trained in the art.

Indeed, the Pursuit Team exerted all their effort to track down the Wild Wolf Squad but couldn’t close the distance. All due to the Squad’s exceptional riding skills.

Although it was good to shake off the pursuers, the problem was Lee Soo-ah found no opportunity to escape.

Surrounded by the Wild Wolf Squad throughout the day, there was no chance for her to slip away. However, a small consolation was that they underestimated Lee Soo-ah enough not to block her energy flow.

Her internal energy remained unrestricted, a significant advantage for Lee Soo-ah.

“Ah! This time was truly thrilling. Not far from Dragon Heaven Valley, we managed to plunder.”

“Weren’t you just a moment away from being caught by the valley’s enforcement team?”

“That’s what made it thrilling! Haha!”

The Wild Wolf Squad chatted amongst themselves, paying no mind to Lee Soo-ah.

They boasted as if bragging, but Lee Soo-ah gleaned much from their conversations.

‘They’re like locusts, moving to a new location immediately after plundering one. If they raid one place, they quickly move to evade danger.’

Dragon Heaven Valley was among the Ten Great Sects.

To dare plunder within a territory of such a formidable power showed their audacity.

“Hmph! You’re all ears like a cat.”

Suddenly, the voice of Wild Wolf Squad’s leader Jeok Ung-cheon interrupted her thoughts.

He was staring intently at Lee Soo-ah, his gaze somewhat frightening, but Lee Soo-ah feigned indifference.

“If you have complaints, scold your men for talking, not me for listening.”

“Brave girl, facing me with such guts. You could become an excellent bandit under my guidance.”

“Hmph! I have no intention of becoming a bandit.”

Lee Soo-ah retorted, eliciting a reaction from the Wild Wolf Squad.

“Such insolence in front of our leader? Do you seek death?”

“Why are you interrupting my conversation with the leader? That’s rude. Your leader must be either generous or incompetent.”

Offended by Lee Soo-ah’s sarcasm, one of the men raised his hand, but Jeok Ung-cheon burst into laughter.

“Ha! A real gem. If only you were a boy, I’d have taken you under my wing.”

“It’s my decision. So far, I’ve never failed to get what I want. You’ll come to think of me as your father.”

“You think my father would stand by for that?”

“Ha! As if your father could stand against me.”

“Don’t underestimate my father. He’s the greatest martial artist in the world.”

“Ha! The audacity of youth. The greatest, you say? Ha!”

Jeok Ung-cheon’s laughter echoed in the sky.

Lee Soo-ah pouted her lips and stared at him defiantly.
