Following the reopening ceremony of the Wudang Sect, the Jianghu remained quiet.

No sect stood out or made any significant moves.

The Jade Heaven Alliance and the Seven Sects seemed to be holding back for the time being. Many were relieved by this. They hoped this balance would continue, allowing peace to endure.

But anyone with even a little insight knew such peace wouldn’t last.

Throughout the winter, both the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Seven Factions had been stockpiling their strength.

Though the Wudang Sect’s gate-opening ceremony had diverted attention, the main players in the Jianghu were still the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Seven Clans.

They had already fought fiercely.

Their grudges against each other were as high as the mountains. There was no way such deep resentment would simply fade over the winter.

Given the slightest opportunity, they would retaliate mercilessly against each other.

It was only a matter of time.

Then, some time later, a rumor began to spread across the Jianghu.

A new sect called the Mad Martial Sect had taken root in the former territory of the Zealous Justice Clan.

The leader of the Mad Martial Sect was none other than the Sura Blade, Lee Gwak.

At first, people didn’t believe the rumor.

The Lee Gwak they knew wasn’t the type to be tied down to any one place. But as time passed, the rumor grew more detailed, and even those who claimed to have visited the Mad Martial Sect in person began to appear.

Only then did people realize the rumor was true.

Unlike the Wudang Sect, the Mad Martial Sect did not held a flashy opening ceremony, but it had already established itself with a solid, functioning system.

“Mad Martial Sect, huh…”

A middle-aged man in green robes muttered to himself as he sat at a table.

His posture was rigid, and an aura as sharp as a blade emanated from his entire body.

The man was Namgung Jin-geom, leader of the Thousand Kingdom School and one of the world’s greatest swordsmen.

Standing before him was his son, Namgung Jin.

Namgung Jin-geom asked, “Is this rumor true?”

“From what we’ve confirmed, yes.”

“Hmph.”

Namgung Jin-geom grunted at his son’s firm reply.

The Mad Martial Sect was a completely unforeseen variable.

No one had expected that Lee Gwak would establish a sect in the Zealous Justice Clan’s old territory.

Its sudden appearance had caught them all off guard.

“And Lee Gwak is the sect leader?”

“That’s correct.”

“Hmph!”

Namgung Jin-geom furrowed his brow deeply at his son’s reply.

Though he rarely showed changes in expression, this unexpected news visibly unsettled him.

“Then it must also be true that the Mad Martial Sect’s strategist is So Bo.”

“That is also correct.”

“Tch.”

Namgung Jin-geom clicked his tongue in frustration.

He regretted losing Lim So-bo’s talents.

Originally, So Bo was jointly employed by the Thousand Kingdom School and the Sky High Castle. However, due to her young age and other complications, she had been left idle at Sky High Castle.

Later, after receiving word from Bang Jin-bo of the Bang Clan Inn, the Thousand Kingdom School released Lim So-bo. Although she was talented, they didn’t know how best to utilize her.

At the time, they hadn’t thought much of letting her go. Her skills were impressive, but they had many other capable people.

“I underestimated her. To solidify the foundation of a new sect so firmly in such a short time…”

Namgung Jin-geom looked regretful.

He knew it was human nature to overvalue what one had lost, but in Lim Sobo’s case, the loss felt particularly bitter.

Namgung Jin wore a similar expression.

“So Bo is truly remarkable. According to our sources, Lee Gwak has given her full authority, and she is freely exercising her talents. She has already turned the Mad Martial Sect into an impregnable fortress.”

“Hmm!”

Honestly, Sobo joining Lee Gwak seems like a stroke of divine luck for the Mad Martial Sect.”

His son’s words stabbed at Namgung Jin-geom’s heart like a dagger.

‘It’s as if the heavens have given Lee Gwak wings.’

He couldn’t help but feel envious of Lee Gwak. At the same time, he was angry at himself for failing to utilize So Bo properly.

“Tsk!”

“Father!”

“What do you think the Mad Martial Sect’s next move will be?”

“For now, they’ll likely lay low and build their strength. Even with So Bo’s addition, their forces are still far inferior to the Seven Sects.”

Namgung Jin answered honestly.

Personally, he owed Lee Gwak a great debt and had a deep connection with Lim So-bo. But in this moment, he stood before his father as the young master of the Thousand Kingdom School. Thus, he had no choice but to consider the sects interests first.

Namgung Jin-geom asked, “What do you think of Lee Gwak?”

“Are you asking for my personal opinion?”

“Yes.”

“Then I’ll answer frankly. He’s an extraordinary man. Not just in martial prowess, but in character—he naturally draws people in. He may not be the most aggressive leader, but his followers make up for what he lacks. Because of that, Mad Martial Sect will grow even faster.”

“For you to praise him so highly…he must be quite something.”

Namgung Jin-geom’s gaze deepened.

The Namgung Jin he knew was fiercely proud and rarely spoke so highly of anyone. Yet here he was, lavishing praise on Yi Gwak.

“Father! May I speak freely?”

“Go ahead.”

“I believe we should establish deep ties with the Mad Martial Sect as soon as possible.”.”

“Why?”

“Because of Lee Gwak. He has the power to strengthen not only himself but also those around him. Under his leadership, So Bo will undoubtedly flourish. The Mad Martial Sect is already impressive, but its future will be even brighter. It will surely become a major force in the Jianghu.”

“Hmm!”

Namgung Jin-geom exhaled thoughtfully at his son’s confident words.

He sat in silence for a long while, lost in thought.

After a long while, he finally spoke.

“Very well. Since you have a connection with him, you may take the lead in contacting them. I’ll entrust all matters regarding the Mad Martial Sect to you.”

“Understood. I won’t disappoint you.”

Namgung Jin answered energetically.

His eyes shone with joy at the prospect of deepening his ties with Lee Gwak.

Namgung Jin-geom smiled faintly as he watched his son.

‘Once the war with the Jade Heaven Alliance is settled, I should pass the leadership to Jin and retire.’

Though he had already reached the absolute realm, Namgung Jin-geom still thirsted for higher realms.

He felt as if he were just one step, one reach, away from grasping what he sought.

But reality constantly pulled him back from complete immersion. His reality didn’t allow him to focus solely on martial arts.

For now, it was impossible, but once conditions permitted, he wanted to hand over the sect to Namgung Jin and devote himself entirely to martial arts. If he could advance further and leave his insights for the Thousand Kingdom School, he felt it would mark a defining moment in his life.

Namgung Jin-geom waved his hand dismissively.

“I’d like to be alone now. You may leave.”

“Yes, Father. Rest well.”

Namgung Jin bowed deeply and exited.

Left alone, Namgung Jin-geom rose and flung open the window.

The nightscape of the Thousand Kingdom School stretched before him, countless lanterns illuminating the darkness.

A century ago, the Thousand Kingdom School had risen from ashes. Its predecessor, the Namgung Clan, had been decimated by the demonic sect. Only two brothers and a few martial artists had survived.

They had rebuilt from nothing, gathered the remnants of fallen noble clans, and founded the Thousand Kingdom School. Over a hundred years had passed since then.

To those living today, it might seem like ancient history, but to a seasoned martial artist like Namgung Jin-geom, it didn’t feel so distant.

From those ashes, the Thousand Kingdom School had grown into a dominant force in the Jianghu. The view of its vast, brilliantly lit compound spoke volumes about its might.

It was a sight that would have made anyone feel proud, but Namgung Jin-geom felt uneasy.

Even he himself couldn’t clearly identify the source of his anxiety.

Sigh. Was it a mistake to ally with them?

He recalled a recent secret meeting.

He and Eun Won-ho, the leader of the Myriad Merchant Troupe, had met with Jinghae of the Wudang Sect.

It was an alliance with the Wudang Sect, once part of the old Nine Great Sects.

Namgung Jin-geom and Eun Won-ho did not hesitate to join hands with Jinghae, as they shared a common enemy: the Jade Heaven Alliance.

They had believed without doubt that the Wudang Sect would become a great source of strength. But contrary to their expectations, the Wudang Sect suffered a humiliating defeat at their opening ceremony, all because of Lee Gwak.

The fact that Jinghae, who had defeated the Green Forest Emperor, Po Cheon-wol, had been effortlessly subdued by Lee Gwak, shocked Namgung Jin-geom deeply.

“Hoo! They say the waves in front are always overtaken by the waves behind, but still…”

Namgung Jin-geom felt the relentless march of time.

In his youth, he knew no fear.

He had charged forward without hesitation, cutting down all obstacles in his path.

As a result, he became one of the world’s greatest martial artists and was revered by all around him.

In his youth, he had taken such admiration for granted.

He believed that strength naturally entitled him to respect.

However, as he aged and his martial prowess increased, he began to feel burdened by the expectations of others.

“Tsk. They say worries multiply with age, I’ve become exactly that.”

Namgung Jin-geom clicked his tongue and shook his head.

His thoughts had grown unnecessarily complicated.

He tried to shut the window and return to his martial arts training, but he paused.

“……”

His eyes sharpened.

A thread of killing intent had reached him from beyond the window.

The audacity of someone daring to send killing intent within the Thousand Kingdom School’s territory enraged him.

Thud!

Namgung Jin-geom kicked off from the windowsill and leapt into the air.

His body soared nearly a hundred feet into the sky.

In the dark sky, he paused for a moment and looked around.

At that moment, a faint ripple of qi brushed against his senses.

The source of the killing intent was moving stealthily through the shadows.

To an ordinary martial artist, the movement would have been imperceptible. But Namgung Jin-geom was no ordinary martial artist.

Through his extensive experience, he knew that each martial artist’s qi had a unique quality and vibration.

The qi moving through the darkness now matched that of the person who had sent the killing intent.

“You dare send killing intent at me in my own backyard?”

Namgung Jin-geom seethed.

The Thousand Kingdom School was his pride.

A legacy he had built and nurtured his entire life. The thought of someone invading that legacy wounded his pride.

Without hesitation, he pursued the assassin.

Swish!

The assassin fled swiftly beyond the sect’s borders.

It was clearly a trap to lure Namgung Jin-geom out. He knew it, too.

But he didn’t care.

‘Just an assassin. No need to alarm the sect.’

With his hands clasped behind his back, Namgung Jin-geom pursued the assassin.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

With each step, his body shot forward dozens of feet.

This was the Divine Steps, a movement technique unrivaled in speed.

At its peak, it allowed one to cover that kind of distance in a single stride, just as Namgung Jin-geom was doing now.

It wasn’t flashy, but in terms of speed, few movement techniques in the world could rival it.

Yet, even with the Divine Steps, he couldn’t easily close the distance between himself and the assassin.

Namgung Jin-geom’s brow twitched.

‘So it’s not just an ordinary assassin.’

Then again, it someone who had infiltrated the Thousand Kingdom School and sent killing intent directly at him.

That alone set them apart from the ordinary.

“Let’s see who you are.”

Crack!

Namgung Jin-geom increased his internal energy further. His already-blinding speed became a streak of light as he closed the gap in an instant.

He could see the back of the assassin’s head as they ran at breakneck speed.

What stood out were their slender frame and long hair wildly whipping in the wind.

But the most striking feature of all was the color of their hair.

‘Half-white?’

Jet-black strands were mixed with snow-white hair, creating an oddly eerie presence.

Namgung Jin-geom’s eyes grew even sharper.

“Stop right there!”

He shouted, swinging his hand. Nearby branches snapped off and shot toward the assassin like arrows.

Swish!

A chilling sound of something slicing through the air echoed through the night sky.

Though they were just branches, infused with Namgung Jin-geom’s internal energy, they held enough power to pierce through stone walls with ease.

Puh-shhk!

But before the branches could reach the assassin, they turned to dust and scattered. The assassin had activated their protective qi.

Namgung Jin-geom came to a stop and spoke.

“This should be secluded enough now…”

Only then did the assassin also come to a stop.

The assassin slowly turned around to face Namgung Jin-geom.

In that instant, Namgung Jin-geom’s lips twitched. He had recognized the assassin’s identity.

“Dan Li-yeon!”
