As with most sects, the Celestial Demon Troupe was primarily composed of men.

There were sects made up entirely of women, but they were very rare in the martial realm.

The Celestial Demon Troupe was no exception. Despite having welcomed countless martial artists over more than a century, the number of women within the Troupe was still relatively small. However, there was one organization within the Troupe composed solely of women.

That organisation was the Celestial Lunar Palace, whose Palace Mistress was the saintess Gu Mun-hye.

Before the Celestial Demon Troupe came into being, there had been the Demonic Cult.

The word “cult” often carried a religious connotation, which is why many people felt a strong aversion to the term Cult.

The Celestial Demon Troupe, inheriting the lineage of the Demonic Cult, tried to minimize its religious aspects as much as possible.

They did so to reduce people’s aversion and broaden their reach.

Yet, for some reason, the Celestial Lunar Palace still maintained some religious characteristics.

The Palace Mistress of the Celestial Lunar Palace was always called the ‘Saintess,’ and the martial artists of the Celestial Demon Troupe believed that the Saintess possessed the power to foresee the future.

That’s why many revered both the Celestial Lunar Palace and Gu Mun-hye, holding her in spiritual regard.

The Celestial Lunar Palace was one of the most heavily guarded places in the Celestial Demon Troupe, along with the Troupe Leader’s Hall.

There were always many martial artists standing guard outside its gates.

However, very few had the freedom to enter and exit the palace.

Men were naturally forbidden from entering, and only the women known as the Moon Shadow Six Fairies could move freely in and out.

The face of the first Moon Shadow Fairy, Jin-ryeong, showed signs of anxiety as she looked at the firmly closed door to Gu Mun-hye’s chambers.

“It’s taking unusually long this time. What kind of dream could she be having…?”

“I know,”

The Second Fairy Oh Cho-hye agreed.

Just as the rumors said, it was indeed true that Gu Mun-hye could foresee the future.

The only difference from the rumors was that her foresight came to her through dreams, wholly independent of her own will, and that these prophetic dreams were exceedingly rare.

Whenever she had such dreams, Gu Mun-hye sank into a profound sleep.

Sometimes, she would sleep an entire day, and the longer she slept, the more accurate her prophetic dream was said to be.

It had already been three days since Gu Mun-hye last emerged from her bedchamber.

Never before had she slept so deeply, so the faces of the Moonshadow Six Fairies were taut

with tension.

They even feared that Gu Mun-hye might never wake up.

Just then—

Creak!

All of a sudden, the door to Gu Mun-hye’s chamber swung open, and she stepped out.

She was dressed in splendid attire, as though she had never been asleep at all.

She wore a silk robe that she rarely wore, with all sorts of jewellery, and her hair was pinned up with numerous hairpins, which added to her elegance.

“Saintess!”

“Are you all right?”

The Moon Shadow Six Fairies hurried to inquire about her well-being.

Gu Mun-hye offered a soft smile.

“I’m fine. There’s no need to worry.”

“Did you see something in your dream?”

“Yes,”

Gu Mun-hye nodded at the First Fairy’s cautious question.

A hint of curiosity flickered across the faces of the Moonshadow Six Fairies.

“What did you see?”

“I’ll tell you later. For now, let’s head to White Lotus Cave.”

“You mean the White Lotus Cave? Then, could it be…?”

“Bring what I had prepared before,” Gu Mun-hye instructed.

“Yes, Saintess!”

Anticipation appeared on the faces of the Moon Shadow Six Fairies.

The White Lotus Cave was located in the deepest part of the Celestial Demon Troupe. It was a place where martial artists went to seek higher enlightenment in their later years. Even the leader of the Troupe could not interfere with this place.

If that were all, the Moon Shadow Six Fairies would not have worn such excited expressions.

At present, a single man was within the White Lotus Cave.

He was a young martial artist, counted among the top few in the Celestial Demon Troupe.

That man was Go Geom Wol, the young master of the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Three years after his return journey from the Jianghu, Go Geom Wol had entered the White Lotus Cave to cultivate in seclusion.

No one knew why he had suddenly gone into seclusion. It was assumed he was cultivating to attain enlightenment.

For three years, Go Geom Wol had not emerged even once.

Because of that, there was much talk.

There were suggestions that the leader should take on new disciples or recruit external talents to prepare for any contingency.

Although most scoffed at these ideas, a few took them seriously.

The leader of the Celestial Demon Troupe, Jin Gwang Hon, had two disciples.

The senior disciple, Go Geom Wol, and the junior disciple, Gwan Il-hyeon.

When both were present, the absence of one was not a significant issue. However, everything changed after Gwan Il-hyeon was killed by Lee Gwak.

Now, Jin Gwang Hon had only Go Geom Wol left.

If anything were to happen to him, there would be no one to lead the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Seeing the gravity of the situation, some people advised Jin Gwang Hon to take on a new disciple. But for some reason, Jin Gwang Hon rejected all of their suggestions.

Next, many went to the White Lotus Cave to plead with Go Geom Wol to come out, yet not once did he respond to their calls.

Time passed, and eventually, people ceased visiting the White Lotus Cave altogether.

The area in front of the rarely visited White Lotus Cave grew eerily quiet.

In front of the White Lotus Cave, which had been deserted for a long time, Gu Mun-hye appeared with the Moon Shadow Six Fairies.

Gu Mun-hye stood quietly, gazing at White Lotus Cave

The entrance was blocked by a thick iron door made from solidified ten-thousand-year cold steel, impervious to attacks from most martial artists.

The Moonshadow Six Fairies followed Gu Mun-hye’s gaze to the entrance of the White Lotus Cave.

Uncertainty lingered on their faces.

They had followed Gu Mun-hye, but they were skeptical about whether Go Geom Wol would really come out today. Unlike them, Gu Mun-hye’s gaze was filled with firm belief.

She stared at the entrance without the slightest tremor in her gaze.

Just then—

Whish!

Without warning, dust began to swirl about the area.

The Moonshadow Six Fairies tilted their heads.

There wasn’t a single breeze blowing in the area, so they were puzzled by the sudden scattering of dust.

Their eyes widened as they searched for the cause.

“Ah!”

“What?”

The iron door of White Lotus Cave, forged from ten-thousand-year cold steel, was crumbling into powder and scattering in the air.

It was terrifying to watch the material, known for its incredible durability, turn to dust – a sight that was both shocking and frightening.

The Moon Shadow Six Fairies trembled uncontrollably, unable to speak.

On the other hand, Gu Mun-hye appeared calm, as if she had anticipated this.

Eventually, the door of solid ten-thousand-year cold steel vanished entirely, and in its place stood someone.

It was a man in very tattered clothing.

His clothes were tattered, as if he hadn’t changed in a long time, and his hair had grown long and covered his face, making it impossible to tell what his original features were.

Yet Gu Mun-hye, without a moment’s hesitation, stepped forward toward the man.

“You’ve finally emerged.”

“I figured you’d be here to meet me.”

The man nodded, as if he had anticipated her presence.

Gu Mun-hye stopped in front of the man and held out her hand. Her white hand brushed back his overgrown hair, revealing his true appearance.

His skin was pale, bereft of sunlight for ages, and he possessed a decadent beauty that seemed almost too delicate for a man.

Gu Mun-hye spoke his name.

“Geom Wol!”

The man was Go Geom Wol.

He had reemerged into the world after three full years.

All at once, the Moon Shadow Six Fairies dropped to their knees and cried out,

“We congratulate the Young Master on his emergence!”

Their eyes brimmed with awe as they gazed upon Go Geom Wol.

He had always been strong, even in the past.

Whenever they laid eyes on Go Geom Wol back then, they would feel an unnameable pressure

that made them bow their heads.

But now, they dared not even lift their faces.

The natural aura pouring from Go Geom Wol’s entire being was overwhelming.

It was a presence they had only ever felt from Jin Gwang-hon, the leader of the Celestial Demon Troupe, and now Go Geom Wol possessed it as well.

‘What level of achievement must the Young Master have reached to possess such an aura…’

This is a blessing for the Celestial Demon Troupe. To think the Young Master has achieved such tremendous cultivation…

The shoulders of the Moon Shadow Six Fairies trembled.

Without a word, Gu Mun-hye gazed upon Go Geom Wol’s face, then produced something from her bosom.

It was a pair of well-sharpened scissors.

Snip, snip!

She began to cut Go Geom Wol’s overgrown hair. Despite the suddenness of her actions, Go Geom Wol did not flinch.

Go Geom Wol stood still, entrusting his head to Gu Mun-hye’s hands. As the unruly hair fell away, his appearance became neat.

Next, Gu Mun-hye brushed his now-short hair with a comb, then used a cord to tie it all back in a tidy bundle.

Gu Mun-hye reached out her hand, and the first of the Moon Shadow Six Fairies presented a bundle she had prepared earlier.

Unwrapping the bundle revealed a neatly folded robe. The black robe, embroidered with gold threads forming various patterns, was made by Gu Mun-hye herself.

She dressed Go Geom Wol in the robe.

The robe, as if tailored for him, fit Go Geom Wol perfectly.

A satisfied smile appeared on Go Geom Wol’s lips.

But Gu Mun-hye’s preparations were not yet finished.

“Jin-ryeong!”

“Yes, Saint!”

At Gu Mun-hye’s call, the first Fairy, Jin-ryeong, approached carrying a long object wrapped in a cloth.

Gu Mun-hye unwrapped the cloth to reveal its contents.

It was a sword.

The scabbard and blade were simple, with no visible adornments.

At first glance, it did not seem to suit Go Geom Wol, yet he felt a greater affection for it than any other divine weapon.

Gu Mun-hye spoke.

“Do you like it? It was specially ordered from Gu Ya-ja.”

“I like it. It’s perfect!”

Go Geom Wol nodded.

Gu Ya-ja was the greatest craftsman in the Celestial Demon Troupe.

His craftsmanship was so revered that every weapon he made was considered a divine weapon. However, he was quirky and only made weapons for those he personally liked.

After his beloved sword Shura was destroyed by Lee Gwak, Go Geom Wol had not wielded any other sword. Such was his preference for a perfect blade.

Go Geom Wol slightly drew the sword.

Whirrrrr!

A resonant hum emanated from the sword.

Go Geom Wol savored the sword’s resonance, feeling the sword’s spirit communicate with him, and his spirit echoed through the sword’s cry.

A weapon that could exchange hearts with its wielder was truly a divine sword.

This new sword even surpassed the Shura he had used before.

Click!

The sound of the sword ended as he sheathed it again.

Go Geom Wol strapped the scabbard to his waist.

The sword, in its black sheath, matched his black robe as if it had always belonged to him.

Go Geom Wol spoke to Gu Mun-hye.

“Let’s go.”

“Yes!”

Go Geom Wol led the way, and naturally, Gu Mun-hye followed.

No words were spoken about their destination, but Gu Mun-hye showed no sign of doubt, following Go Geom Wol as if she already knew everything.

As they moved, the Moon Shadow Six Fairies also rose and followed.

A curious look appeared on their faces.

For the past three years, Go Geom Wol had never once come out, and similarly, Gu Mun-hye had never once visited the White Lotus Cave.

They had not met once in that time, nor exchanged any messages.

Even so, the two of them acted as naturally as if they knew each other’s intentions.

Such familiarity felt strange to the Moon Shadow Six Fairies.

Have they been communing in secret all this time without our knowledge?

But how?

The Moon Shadow Six Fairies were Gu Mun-hye’s closest companions.

They had never left her side—not once.

At least one of them was always with her, keeping watch.

Not for a single moment had Gu Mun-hye been alone.

And yet, seeing her behave as though she had been in constant contact with Go Geom Wol left them bewildered.

Go Geom Wol walked without hesitation.

Exiting the White Lotus Cave, the place he headed to was the main hall of the Celestial Demon

Troupe.

“Young Master!”

“Have you emerged?”

The martial artists guarding the main grounds dropped to their knees in surprise.

But Go Geom Wol passed them by without a word.

“What is going on?”

“I’ve no idea!”

Blinking, the martial artists watched Go Geom Wol’s retreating figure.

Even the Moon Shadow Six Fairies who followed behind him and Gu Mun-hye had no clue what was happening.

Just then, Gu Mun-hye’s low voice drifted to their ears.

“Now, the heavens are going to change.”
