Go San-ja took the two children to the deepest, most secretive part of the White Light Sect.

It was the forbidden area of White Light Sect, surrounded by tall walls and protected by layers of mechanisms, formations, and numerous martial experts stationed secretly around it.

Only a very few, permitted individuals could enter this place.

Go San-ja passed several checkpoints to enter the forbidden area.

Inside, it was like another world.

Rare and exotic flowers formed mountains of blooms, and in a mirror-clear pond, colorful fish swam.

At the center of the pond stood a lavish pavilion, to which Go San-ja led the children. The bridge connected to the pavilion was even covered with a red carpet, showcasing the pinnacle of extravagance.

As they walked along the deep, sinking carpet to the pavilion, they saw an old woman whose age was impossible to guess.

Her face was covered with deep wrinkles, and from the sagging eyes visible between the wrinkles, pus was leaking.

She was Noh Tae-tae, the one who had called for the children.

Go San-ja deeply bowed to Noh Tae-tae and said,

“I have brought the children.”

Noh Tae-tae lifted her head to look at the children.

Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah felt chills run down their bodies but tried not to show it.

They greeted her with forced composure.

“Lee Cheong greets Noh Tae-tae.”

“Lee Soo-ah greets Noh Tae-tae.”

Noh Tae-tae gestured with her hand and said,

Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah sat down on either side of Noh Tae-tae as if it was prearranged.

Noh Tae-tae stroked the children’s hands and said,

“Beautiful, so beautiful. I, too, was once as beautiful and fine as you are. If only I could, I would exchange my youth with you.”

“Noh Tae-tae is still beautiful.”

“Hehe! Flattery, but it sounds pleasant.”

Noh Tae-tae laughed, revealing her teeth, some missing, but considering her age, surprisingly healthy.

She held the children’s hands tightly.

“Would you not like to hear my story?”

Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah’s faces darkened slightly, but they forced smiles and answered in unison,

“Good children. You know to listen to an old woman’s tales. So, let me tell you about when I was very young. My father was the wealthiest man under the heavens at that time…”

Noh Tae-tae’s long, winding story began.

Noh Tae-tae liked to start her stories by talking about how her father made money and accumulated the greatest wealth under the heavens.

“My father was not satisfied with just amassing wealth. He was a loyal supporter of the Divine Sect. Everything he accumulated was for the Divine Sect. Among the many people in the world, only my father could be called a true loyalist of the Divine Sect.”

Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah chimed in appropriately.

Noh Tae-tae enjoyed the children’s responses.

Before Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah, she had often made children sit and listen to her stories. Many of those children met tragic ends.

They were the ones who did not respond properly or showed signs of drowsiness.

Knowing this, Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah listened intently to Noh Tae-tae’s voice, maintaining their tension.

Cunningly, Noh Tae-tae never called the children when their mother was around, choosing only the times she was away. Each time, the children had to suppress their fear and smile.

Perhaps that’s why Noh Tae-tae kept seeking them out.

Anger flashed in Noh Tae-tae’s eyes.

“If it weren’t for the Fist Demon , that damned man, killing my father, the history of the Jianghu wouldn’t have flowed this way. This Jianghu, which allowed such a cruel and lawless man to emerge, has no reason to exist.”

At that moment, Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah felt chills, even though they had heard the story many times and were familiar with its flow.

Such was the depth of Noh Tae-tae’s hatred.

“Do you know how much I suffered afterward? Hiding from the Jade Heaven Alliance’s eyes, I fiercely protected the wealth my father left behind. I gave birth to a son, raised him, and prospered our lineage to create today’s White Light Sect. Look, all of this was created over more than a hundred years by me.”

Madness tinged Noh Tae-tae’s voice. Tears or pus leaked from her eyes, but she paid it no mind.

“Mark my words. I will personally eradicate this cursed Jianghu, Jade Heaven Alliance included. When that time comes, you must bear witness for me. Understand?”

“Good children. I’ve never seen children as good as you in my lifetime. How wonderful it would be if you were my own grandchildren? You’d comfort me and talk to me every day.”

Noh Tae-tae tightened her grip on the children’s hands.

Her grip was surprisingly strong for someone of her age, leaving the children’s wrists almost bruised. Still, Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah smiled.

They knew all too well the consequences of showing any discomfort here.

Silently, the children called each other’s names, enduring together.

It was at the peak of Noh Tae-tae’s self-absorption when the moment was interrupted.

“Grandmother, this is Gong-yeo.”

From across the bridge by the pond, someone’s voice was heard.

In an instant, a delighted expression appeared on Noh Tae-tae’s face.

The person across the pond appeared to be an elderly man over sixty.

The man was so plump that he resembled a round ball, to the extent that his eyes and nose were almost buried in his flesh.

He was Won Gong-yeo, the sect leader of White Light Sect.

Won Gong-yeo looked at Noh Tae-tae with a respectful expression.

“Grandmother, I have something to tell you. May I come over?”

“Hehe! My grandson wishes to come over, how could I possibly refuse? Please, come across.”

With Noh Tae-tae’s permission, Won Gong-yeo, with his corpulent body, crossed the bridge.

Noh Tae-tae offered him the seat right in front of her.

Won Gong-yeo carefully took his seat.

Noh Tae-tae looked at Won Gong-yeo and smiled.

“Hehe! How can you be so devoted? It’s as if my father has been reincarnated; it brings me so much joy.”

“It makes me happy to see Grandmother pleased.”

“Yes! But even though you must be busy, for what reason does my grandson seek me?”

“Actually, there’s something urgent I need to discuss with Grandmother. So, may I ask for the children to be excused for a moment?”

Won Gong-yeo’s gaze shifted to Lee Soo-ah and Lee Cheong seated on either side of Noh Tae-tae.

Lee Soo-ah and Lee Cheong thought this was a good turn of events, but Noh Tae-tae tightened her grip on the children’s hands instead.

“These children have become companions who keep this old woman company. They are quite tight-lipped, so they won’t speak of anything they hear here. Isn’t that right?”

Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah responded without hesitation.

They knew well who the real power behind White Light Sect was. While Won Gong-yeo might be the sect leader, the true ruler holding their hands was Noh Tae-tae.

Won Gong-yeo’s exceedingly respectful demeanor wasn’t just a display of filial piety. Noh Tae-tae was White Light Sect’s founding ancestor, and her influence spanned the entire sect.

Falling out of favor with Noh Tae-tae meant even someone as high-ranking as Won Gong-yeo could end up isolated. Noh Tae-tae still held that level of authority.

Noh Tae-tae smiled satisfactorily at the children’s response.

“So, what is this urgent matter?”

“Jade Heaven Alliance has mobilized the Hidden Blood Squad.”

“Yes! Their response has been quicker than expected. Already, several Blood Rain Assassins have been captured by the Hidden Blood Squad and lost their lives.”

“It might be time to withdraw the Blood Rain Assassins.”

“Hehe! If my grandson has decided so, then it shall be. Why bother coming to me for permission for such things? Did you come here just because you thought this old woman might be lonely?”

“It’s been a while since we last saw each other, hasn’t it?”

“How can you be so kind and admirable?”

Noh Tae-tae looked at Won Gong-yeo with a content expression.

Her son had passed away early, and her daughter-in-law had also died of illness. Fortunately, Won Gong-yeo had grown up admirably and was bringing her joy.

She had seen her great-grandchildren and even her great-great-grandchildren, but still, Won Gong-yeo was her favorite.

“So, aside from the matter of the Blood Rain Assassins, how is the Jianghu these days? Stuck here, I have no idea. Is there anyone we should be wary of? If there’s even a slight chance they could disrupt our sect’s activities, they must be eliminated. It was the same a hundred years ago. Trying to recruit Demon Fist, my father ended up losing his life to him instead. We can’t let such an event repeat.”

“Actually, there is someone I’ve been concerned about recently.”

“Who is it? If they’re affiliated with the Ten Sects, we must handle them carefully.”

“They’re not part of the Ten Sects.”

“Oh! Not part of the Ten Sects and still managed to catch my grandson’s attention? Who is this person?”

“A man known as Lee Gwak, also known by the nickname ‘Sura Blade’ in the Jianghu.”

“Sura Blade? That’s a chilling nickname.”

Sometimes, just hearing someone’s name or nickname can evoke a strong emotional reaction. That was the case for Noh Tae-tae at that moment.

The moment she heard the nickname ‘Sura Blade’, she felt an indescribable, strange emotion.

A young girl might not understand the nature of the feelings she’s experiencing, but someone like Noh Tae-tae, who has lived for many years, could clearly identify the essence of her emotions.

The emotion she felt was aversion.

An intense aversion that made her feel nauseous just hearing his name and nickname, signifying a severe incompatibility with her nature.

Such a strong sense of aversion was something she hadn’t felt since the Demon Fist of Mount Hua a hundred years ago.

“What’s known about this man?”

“Not much is known yet. He was merely an outer hall martial artist of the Jade Heaven Alliance, but six years ago, he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Celestial Demon Troupe and went missing.”

“His martial skills weren’t particularly outstanding up to that point, I assume?”

“That’s correct. He must have encountered some fortuitous event. He claims to be a disciple of the Mad Martial Sect, but it’s unclear if such a sect even exists. Have you ever heard of Mad Martial Sect, Grandmother?”

“Then he might be lying, or it could be a hidden sect.”

“The name Lee Gwak sticks in my heart like a thorn. I haven’t felt this way in a long time. It’s as if there’s a hole in my heart.”

“Then we shall eliminate him. There was already a letter from Munhoe suggesting that we do so.”

“Mun-hoe made that judgment too?”

Gu Mun-hoe was one of her great-grandsons.

His real name was Yang Mun-hoe, but he was known as Gu Mun-hoe, assisting Yong Cheon Myeong.

Gu Mun-hoe was White Light Sect’s secret weapon, infiltrated into the Jade Heaven Alliance to bring it down from the inside.

Astronomical funds and numerous schemes were executed to place Gu Mun-hoe close to Yong Cheon Myeong. If Yong Cheon Myeong hadn’t become despaired, no matter how meticulous White Light Sect’s schemes were, inserting Gu Mun-hoe as his confidant would have been impossible.

Gu Mun-hoe’s operation proceeded smoothly. It was only a matter of time before Yong Cheon Myeong would become the leader of Jade Heaven Alliance.

Once Yong Cheon Myeong became the Alliance’s leader and Gu Mun-hoe his second in command, wielding immense power, the Jade Heaven Alliance would secretly begin to crumble from within, assuming everything went as planned.

However, Yong Cheon Myeong had been greatly disturbed since his encounter with Lee Gwak.

His prestige waned, and his state of mind became unstable.

Gu Mun-hoe judged Lee Gwak to be a destabilizing factor for Yong Cheon Myeong. Allowing Lee Gwak to further unsettle Yong Cheon Myeong was unacceptable.

Noh Tae-tae glanced at the children she held by the hands.

Perhaps due to the serious nature of the conversation, Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah’s faces had stiffened.

“What about sending the Assassin King?”

“The Assassin King is currently fulfilling a task for Yong Cheon Myeong. There are still sects that haven’t been shaken up enough and require further destabilization.”

“Hmm! Then, who would be best to send?”

“I am considering sending Ghost Spear and Death King .”

“Hmm! You mean to send two of the Four Heavenly Kings at once? Isn’t that too excessive?”

“He has already killed Moon Gwang, one of the Four Heavenly Kings. It is not excessive at all.”

“Moon Gwang was killed by him?”

A chilling killing intent flashed in Noh Tae-tae’s eyes, which also tightened the grip on the children’s hands.

Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah’s faces involuntarily contorted, but they did not scream out. A whirlwind of emotions more significant than pain swirled within them.

Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah looked at each other.

It was a name they had heard incessantly from their mother.

Their mother’s voice echoed in their ears.

“Never forget. Your father’s name is Lee Gwak.”
