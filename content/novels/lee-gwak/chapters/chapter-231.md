The Great Heavenly Blood War completely overturned the order of the Jianghu that had been maintained for hundreds of years. The existing martial sects disappeared into the annals of history, and new prestigious families emerged to dominate the pinnacle of the Jianghu.

The current rulers of the Jianghu, the Ten Sects, were those who did not miss the flow of the times and emerged victorious. In contrast, the Old Nine Sects and the Five Great Families were left behind, unable to keep up with the changing times.

Among the Old Nine Sects, the Mount Hua Sect, Shaolin Temple, Wudang Sect, Qingcheng Sect, and Emei Sect managed to secure the last place among the Ten Sects and maintained their existence, but the name of the Five Great Families was almost forgotten in people’s minds.

People unrelated to the Jianghu thought that the Five Great Families had completely disappeared, but martial artists knew that the Five Great Families still existed.

One of the Ten Sects, and called the champion of the east, the Thousand Kingdom School was, in fact, a union of the Five Great Families.

A hundred years ago, one of the Five Great Families, the Namgung Family, was devastatingly defeated by the invasion of the demonic cult. The only remaining blood relatives of the Namgung Family were the young brothers Namgung Seon-hwi and Namgung Yeong-hwi. Everyone thought the Namgung Family was finished. The brothers were too young to inherit the secrets of the Namgung Family and had no one to protect them.

However, like a miracle, the brothers managed to revive the Namgung Family and established the Thousand Kingdom School by gathering members from other families trampled by the demonic cult.

Over the past hundred years, the Thousand Kingdom School has grown tremendously.

They absorbed not only the members of the Five Great Families but also their martial arts and assets, which made them the most solid foundation among the Ten Sects.

A middle-aged man in green robes stood on a high mountain overlooking the Thousand Kingdom School.

The middle-aged man was like a finely honed sword.

Just by standing there, a fierce aura emanated from him, engulfing the surrounding area. Even the blowing wind seemed to be frightened away by the middle-aged man.

Next to the middle-aged man stood a young man in his late twenties, quietly. The young man bore a striking resemblance to the middle-aged man.

The young man called out to the middle-aged man.

Only then did the middle-aged man turn his gaze to look at the young man, who cautiously continued.

“Do you really intend to go to the Jade Heaven Alliance? Wouldn’t it be better to reconsider at this time?”

“Ja Hong Cheon is calling us so desperately, shouldn’t we go see?”

“Do you really need to go yourself, Father? The other supremes of the Ten Sects will probably send representatives or successors. Wouldn’t it be better for me to go? That would be more fitting.”

“Right now, the issue isn’t about status. What’s important is Ja Hong Cheon’s intentions. He’s going through all these complicated procedures to gather the supremes of the Ten Sects in one place for a reason.”

“The heavenly energy is unstable. It wasn’t this unsettled even during the war with the Celestial Demon Troupe a few years ago. Coincidentally, since the invitation from the Jade Heaven Alliance arrived, the heavenly energy has been tumultuous. It means, in one way or another, Ja Hong Cheon is involved.”

“That’s why I must go myself to see with my own eyes what Ja Hong Cheon is up to.”

The young martial artist gave up on trying to convince his father further.

Suddenly, a knowing smile appeared on his lips.

It was unclear who was worrying about whom.

His father was the leader of Thousand Kingdom School.

Namgung Jin-geom, the Dark Heavenly Lone Star.

Namgung Jin-geom was the strongest in the history of the Thousand Kingdom School and one of the absolute greatest experts in the world. The young martial artist was Namgung In, the son of Namgung Jin-geom.

Namgung In, the Invincible Sword.

He was a young genius, the deputy leader of the Thousand Kingdom School and a member of the Ten Lesser Skies.

Because of Namgung Jin-geom, the Thousand Kingdom School was enjoying its greatest era in history. Namgung In was expected to take over his father’s legacy and expand the Thousand Kingdom School even further.

Namgung Jin-geom looked at Namgung In with a pleased expression.

The reason he could leave his position without hesitation was because his son, Namgung In, was solidly supporting him.

The leader of the Thousand Kingdom School could not be strong in martial arts alone.

To lead the Thousand Kingdom School, a union of five families, one needed to possess both strong leadership and political skills. Fortunately, Namgung In was equipped with all these elements.

Even if he left, Namgung In would be able to lead the Thousand Kingdom School excellently.

“Yeon-hwa has already gone ahead to the Jade Heaven Alliance to prepare for your arrival. Please look for Yeon-hwa first.”

“But, are you sure you want to go alone? Wouldn’t it be better to take at least the Sword Soul Squad with you?”

“I prefer to go alone. Don’t worry about me. You should pay special attention to the situation in Jianghu. With the heavenly energy being this unstable, something is bound to happen.”

“Understood, Father. I will do as you say.”

“I am always reassured having you here.”

Namgung Jin-geom smiled and patted Namgung In’s shoulder a couple of times.

Having his son made him feel at ease to go to the Jade Heaven Alliance.

His gaze was already set on the Jade Heaven Alliance.

A man gasped, his eyes wide open.

The world appeared entirely blood-red to him.

He felt his chest with his hand, encountering a cold sensation.

A sharp sword had pierced through his chest, protruding out.

The man clenched his teeth and turned around, only to see a woman with a curvaceous figure. She had ambushed him from behind.

He reached out to grab the woman, but she swiftly stepped back, evading his grasp.

Distrust flickered across the man’s face.

The woman was clearly a new servant brought in a few days ago. He had been eyeing her due to her exceptional beauty, but had been postponing any advances due to lack of opportunity.

“How could you…? Weren’t you just an ordinary servant?”

She just looked at the man with a gloomy expression.

The man’s name was Lee Chi-su.

He was the owner of a small trading company that had nothing to do with Jianghu.

Struggling, Lee Chi-su tried to pull out the sword embedded in his chest. However, the deeply embedded sword did not budge.

With a heavy sound, Lee Chi-su collapsed. He convulsed a few times before his breathing stopped.

Finally, the woman exhaled softly, approached Lee Chi-su, and pulled out the sword.

Lee Chi-su, as if feeling wronged, had not closed his eyes even in death. It seemed as if his gaze was still fixed on the woman.

As the woman stroked her face, a mask as thin as cicada wings peeled off, revealing her original features.

She was a striking beauty, with dark, deep eyebrows, sharp nose, and red lips reminiscent of plum blossoms.

She was none other than Han So-cheon.

Han So-cheon had disguised herself as a servant to assassinate Lee Chi-su, waiting for days to successfully complete her mission. However, her expression was not one of relief.

‘Why did I have to kill this man?’

Up until now, those she had killed were all key figures of the Ten Sects, all connected to the Jianghu.

In contrast, Lee Chi-su had no connection or intersection with the Jianghu whatsoever.

The trading company he ran was so small that it only dealt with inconsequential goods.

Although he was not without his vices, particularly in his indulgence in pleasure, he had never committed a crime serious enough to warrant an assassination.

Han So-cheon could not easily understand why she was ordered to assassinate such a man.

Even though following orders was the fate of an assassin, this particular mission was hard for her to accept.

Han So-cheon let out another deep sigh.

Despite not feeling entirely at ease, she had completed the mission given to her.

“Now I can finally return to the children.”

She had lived in isolation, cutting herself off from the world to focus solely on her mission. She had minimized any outside contact and devoted all her attention to ensuring the assassination’s success.

Because of this, she knew nothing of the world’s affairs or the state of Jianghu. But none of that mattered to her.

The only thing that mattered to Han So-cheon was the safety of her children.

Although the White Light Sect had promised to protect them, she couldn’t help but worry about leaving her children behind, especially about Lee Cheong’s well-being.

She feared that something might have gone wrong, or that his condition might have worsened.

It was when Han So-cheon was about to put on her mask again to leave the mansion.

Suddenly, a sharp sound of breaking air echoed.

Instinctively, Han So-cheon leaped away.

The spot where she had been standing was struck by a sword energy.

The expression hidden beneath Han So-cheon’s mask contorted.

Then, as the ceiling collapsed, a group of people burst into the room.

They surrounded Han So-cheon, their killing intent rising.

When she saw their faces, Han So-cheon’s eyes shook visibly. They were familiar faces.

Among them, one figure stood out.

He was a lean middle-aged martial artist, resembling a bamboo stick, with eyes devoid of any emotion like a venomous snake, and skin so pale as if he had never been touched by sunlight.

A sinister aura seemed to swirl around his entire being, distorting the air around him.

He was Cheol Geuk jin, the Hidden Blood Squad Chief.

Cheol Geuk jin and the people who appeared with him were members of the Hidden Blood Squad, where she had once belonged.

They included the leader of one of the Squad’s teams, Cheol Gwan Ho, among other familiar faces. They surrounded Han So-cheon, emitting waves of killing intent.

If she hadn’t been wearing her mask, her bewildered expression would have been plainly visible.

Six years ago, when Han So-cheon realized she was pregnant, she hadn’t returned to the Hidden Blood Squad. Knowing that they had already abandoned her, she had no regrets. But to unexpectedly encounter them in such a place made her heart race.

Cheol Geuk jin stepped forward.

“How dare you assassinate martial artists from the orthodox sects. Are you aware of the great chaos you and the Blood Rain Assassins have caused in the Jianghu?”

“Of course, an assassin like you wouldn’t think of such things while carrying out your missions, would you? Who’s behind this? Reveal who hired you.”

Han So-cheon kept her lips tightly sealed, choosing not to respond.

She feared that saying anything would reveal her identity to them.

Having shared years of camaraderie within the Hidden Blood Squad, they were familiar with her voice, gaze, and even her scent. Any careless word could easily betray her.

As Han So-cheon’s silence prolonged, Cheol Geuk jin’s killing intent thickened.

Key figures of the Ten Sects had been assassinated across the land, prompting the Hidden Blood Squad to move to uncover the mastermind.

Assassins know best the ways of other assassins.

That’s why the Hidden Blood Squad was mobilized.

They realized there was an exceptionally skilled assassin among them and tracked this individual down to be Han So-cheon.

The more they traced Han So-cheon’s movements, the more astonished they were. The martial artists she had assassinated were all remarkable masters.

Her ability to assassinate such formidable experts without leaving a trace not only aroused their competitive spirit but also heightened their alertness.

They pursued Han So-cheon relentlessly, and finally cornered her here.

Cheol Geuk jin stepped forward.

“Will you surrender quietly and be subdued? Or will you resist and have all the tendons in your limbs severed?”

Instead of answering, Han So-cheon drew her sword.

The fact that the Hidden Blood Squad had tracked her down was unexpected, but she had no intention of being captured without a fight. Not when the lives of her children waiting at White Light Sect depended on it.

If she died here, so would Lee Cheong.

Without her, the White Light Sect would have no reason to give the life-saving Soul Pills to Lee Cheong, who would then be seen as worthless. For her children’s sake, she must survive this ordeal.

Cheol Geuk jin’s eyes darkened with killing intent.

“Subdue her. Keep her alive for transport to the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

At his command, the Hidden Blood Squad members, who had been waiting for the opportunity, attacked Han So-cheon.

The air tore as the Hidden Blood Squad’s swords targeted her vital points.

Even by sound alone, it was evident.

The skill level of the Hidden Blood Squad had improved immensely since the past. But they were not the only ones who had progressed.

Han So-cheon, too, had achieved remarkable growth over the past six years.

Han So-cheon’s sword deflected the Hidden Blood Squad’s attacks.

A whirlwind of blades swept through space.

It was a fight between assassins.

Yet, despite the fierce movements, not a footstep nor a breath was heard.

Cheol Geuk jin tilted his head, puzzled.

Something about Han So-cheon’s movements, physique, and even her gaze felt eerily familiar. It was as though he had seen it somewhere before, but he couldn’t quite recall.

A chilling sound of slicing air suddenly erupted.

Seizing the moment, Han So-cheon unleashed her full power in a sword strike. Caught off-guard by her unexpected assault, the Hidden Blood Squad’s formation was disrupted.

Han So-cheon didn’t miss the gap and leaped towards the window.

A hole was punched through the window as Han So-cheon’s figure vanished.

The Hidden Blood Squad members pursued her.
