The Martial Sword Alliance was the dominant power in the southern part of Jianghu.

Created around the core of the former Haenam Sect, the Martial Sword Alliance had attracted numerous other sects, swelling its ranks and influence.

People commonly referred to the core of the Martial Sword Alliance as the “Central Sect”, the “Three Gates”, and the “Five Halls”.

The “Central Sect” referred to the Haenam Sect, the “Three Gates” were the White Blood Sect, the Moon Spear Sect, and the Five Red Sects.

Finally, the Five Halls include the Tae Mu Hall, the Five Tigers Hall, the True Martial Hall, the Upper Moon Hall and the Central Heaven Hall. Beyond these, countless other sects also composed part of the Martial Sword Alliance.

At the center of the Martial Sword Alliance was Yu Mun Sang, the Southern Sea Martial Emperor.

Yu Mun Sang was widely recognized as the greatest Martial Artist in the southern sea and the spiritual pillar of the Alliance.

His presence alone enabled the Martial Sword Alliance to stay united and safe amid the chaos stirred by the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Currently, Jianghu was being swept by the storm of bloodshed unleashed by the Jade Heaven Alliance, but the regions under the control of the Martial Sword Alliance remained as safe as a windless zone.

The Martial Sword Alliance joined hands with Dragon Heaven Valley to establish a frontline in the north. By setting the line of battle far to the north, away from the Martial Sword Alliance, they protected their people.

Thanks to this, the people living in the Martial Sword Alliance’s territory could lead their lives without worry of the ongoing conflict.

Many praised Yu Mun Sang’s reign for this reason.

At least in the Southern Jianghu, Yu Mun Sang was revered almost as a deity.

His authority was at its peak, and countless martial artists were ready to give their lives at his word.

In the largest hall of the Martial Sword Alliance, numerous Martial Artists had gathered.

They were all members of the Alliance’s leadership.

It had been a long time since the leaders of the Martial Sword Alliance had gathered in one place after the conflict started.

The masters of the Central Sect, the Three Gates, and the Five Halls, as well as the heads of countless other organisations, all stood together, gazing at the gigantic throne in the centre of the hall.

On the grand throne, adorned with ornate patterns, sat a middle-aged man in blue martial robes.

He radiated such a vast, unending presence, akin to a boundless ocean, that it seemed to press down on everyone in the grand hall. It was Yu Mun Sang, the Southern Sea Martial Emperor.

Next to Yu Mun Sang stood a robust man in his mid-thirties, with an extraordinary build and presence.

His eyes beneath his dark eyebrows were fierce as a tiger’s, and beneath his tightly sealed lips

a short, bristly beard covered his square jaw. The armband around his arm was vividly engraved with a soaring black dragon.

Although the Martial Sword Alliance had countless martial artists, there was only one who possessed such striking traits and presence: the ‘Mad Dragon’, Woo Mun Pae.

He was a disciple of Yu Mun Sang, the Young Master of the Alliance, and a member of the Ten Lesser Skies, making him one of the strongest young martial artists under the heavens.

Woo Mun Pae continued Yu Mun Sang’s formidable presence. If all went well, he would succeed Yu Mun Sang as ruler of the Martial Sword Alliance.

In recent years, Woo Mun Pae’s momentum had become even more intense, reflecting significant advancements in his martial arts skills.

Advancing further when already at the pinnacle of martial arts was no easy task, but Woo Mun Pae had achieved a remarkable increase in his martial prowess through his own relentless efforts and the teachings of Yu Mun Sang.

He could no longer be defined by terms like “Ten Young Masters” or “promising talents of the next generation”. At least in southern Jianghu, he had a presence on par with Yu Mun Sang.

Yu Mun Sang’s gaze shifted towards one of the leaders. An elderly man with a goatee stepped

forward.

The old man was Go Won-mu, the strategist of the Martial Sword Alliance known as ‘Jegal of the South Sea.’

With his cunning strategies and insightful understanding of Yu Mun Sang’s true intentions, Go Won-mu had led the Martial Sword Alliance to success.

As a result, many placed their trust in Go Won-mu.

Yu Mun Sang spoke to Go Won-mu.

“Since everyone is here, let us begin.”

“Yes, Alliance Lord.”

Go Won-mu bowed deeply to Yu Mun Sang, then turned his gaze to the leaders assembled in the grand hall.

In terms of martial skill alone, Go Won-mu was likely the weakest among those present. Yet his piercing gaze was more than enough to overwhelm everyone in the hall, regardless of their martial prowess.

He opened his mouth to speak.

“Yesterday, a request for reinforcements arrived from Dragon Heaven Valley.

“Are they asking for more personnel beyond those we’ve already dispatched?”

“Exactly so, Lord Gung.”

“In that case, this is our chance.”

The elderly man in his late fifties who had asked the question offered a faint smile.

He was Gung Chu-san, the Master of White Blood Sect—one of the Three Gates.

Apart from Yu Mun Sang and Go Won-mu, he was the highest-ranking figure in the Martial Sword Alliance.

As a result, he knew more of the secrets of the Martial Sword Alliance than almost anyone else, and was well aware of Yu Mun Sang’s true intentions.

Go Won-mu gave a subtle smile as he replied.

‘That’s right. This is a golden opportunity for us, if we fail to take advantage of it, the Alliance Lord’s grand dream will be delayed indefinitely.”

Everyone focused on Go Won-mu’s words.

The people in this hall knew how grand and vast Yu Mun Sang’s ambitions were, and they understood the implications of the words of Gong and Go Won Mu.

‘At last…’

‘Is it beginning now?’

Their gazes changed.

None of them even took a deep breath as they continued to watch Go Won-mu.

“The most crucial matter is whom to send. Please, feel free to speak your mind about who should go.”

“Given the gravity of the matter, isn’t it only right that the young master himself should go?”

“Exactly. Only Young Master Woo Mun Pae, the disciple of the Alliance Lord, can bring glory to the Martial Sword Alliance”.

“Correct,”

At Go Won-mu’s words, the leaders unanimously endorsed Woo Mun Pae, as if they had been waiting for just this moment.

Woo Mun Pae, who was standing by Yu Mun Sang’s side, smiled slightly. This was the reaction he had hoped for.

Go Won-mu looked at Yu Mun Sang and spoke.

“Since everyone agrees, it seems right to send the young master for this mission.”

Yu Mun Sang then turned his gaze to Woo Mun Pae.

An intense light flashed in his eyes, as if a massive storm was brewing within them.

“Pae!”

“Yes, Master.”

“Can you handle it?”

“Just entrust it to me. I will definitely meet your expectations.”

“The hundred-year grand plan of our Alliance hinges on this mission.”

“I understand, Master.”

Woo Mun Pae looked at Yu Mun Sang with smoldering eyes.

His gaze, brimming with fighting spirit, seemed to satisfy Yu Mun Sang.

“Good. If you succeed in this mission, you shall become the Alliance Lord of the Martial Sword Alliance.”

“Ma…Master?”

“I will bear all the world’s criticisms. You must ensure this task is completed and set Martial Sword Alliance on a rock-solid foundation for generations to come.”

“Of course, Master. Thank you for your trust.”

Thud!

Woo Mun Pae knelt on one knee in front of Yu Mun Sang. Seeing this, the other leaders all followed suit.

Yu Mun Sang stood up from his throne, his towering presence pressing down on the hall.

“Everyone may criticize us. Our hard-earned reputation may vanish, and we may be pointed at. But we must take this path. Without change, we will be left behind by the flow of the world. History has proved this. Look at the Old Major Sects. Their past glories have vanished, only their names remain. Old glories do not affect the present. To survive, we must change, and change inevitably involves pain. But if we endure this pain, the Martial Sword Alliance will stand firm and glorious for at least a few hundred years.”

The power in Yu Mun Sang’s voice overwhelmed the assembly.

It wasn’t just because he was the supreme leader of the Martial Sword Alliance. His track record proved that his convictions were not mere fantasies.

Since Yu Mun Sang had become the Leader, the Martial Sword Alliance was enjoying its greatest period of prosperity.

The current Martial Sword Alliance that Yu Mun Sang had created made everyone anticipate the future he would build.

A tremor ran through the leaders’ shoulders, reflecting their tumultuous feelings.

Yu Mun Sang placed his broad hand on Woo Mun Pae’s shoulder.

“This is the weight of one who walks the path of dominance—and it is yours to bear. I believe you will do well.”

Woo Mun Pae bit his lip tightly under the weight of that burden.

“I will succeed at any cost, Master!”

“I believe you will.”

Yu Mun Sang’s calm words stirred Woo Mun Pae’s blood.

Yu Mun Sang’s gaze swept over the leaders.

“Support the young master with your best efforts. Give him whatever he needs.”

“Understood!”

The leaders responded in unison.

The great hall heated with the fervor they exuded.

It was a while before the meeting ended.

Everyone left, and Yu Mun Sang alone looked over the empty hall, his gaze deep and contemplative.

He remained seated deeply in his throne, staring straight ahead.

Yu Mun Sang liked this kind of silence.

He liked the sensation that everything in the world vanished and he was alone. Regrettably, that peaceful moment did not last long.

“Alliance Lord! Are you inside?”

A quiet voice outside broke the silence.

Yu Mun Sang’s brow twitched.

Had it been someone else disturbing his silence, he would never have let it pass. But the owner of that voice was someone even he found somewhat intimidating, so he could not simply ignore it.

Is it you sister?

“May I come in to speak with you for a moment?”

“Come in.”

As Yu Mun Sang granted permission, the doors of the grand hall opened and a graceful woman entered.

She was momentarily startled by the darkness of the great hall, but soon walked confidently towards Yu Mun Sang as if the darkness was no obstacle.

This level of darkness posed no hindrance to her.

“Sister.”

Yu Mun Sang looked at the woman.

She was Sa Yeon-hee, a woman of dazzling beauty that shone even in the darkness.

She was the master of Sword Sect, an organization within the Martial Sword Alliance that maintained its own independence.

The Sword Sect was the place where Hae Sowol—who had founded the Martial Sword Alliance a hundred years prior—retreated in his later years. From generation to generation, they took on a single disciple to carry on their legacy.

Even within the Martial Sword Alliance, the Sword Sect boasted a unique status. It had been established as a separate body to keep the Alliance Lord in check.

The orders of the Alliance Lord did not apply to the master of the Sword Sect; they could only advise. Conversely, in emergencies, the master of the Sword Sect could act as the interim Alliance Lord.

The term “emergency” was quite broad, but one thing was clear: it was the only position within the Martial Sword Alliance that could check the leader.

During times like these, when the authority of the leader was at its peak, this did not pose much of a threat, but Yu Mun Sang could hardly appreciate having someone with the grounds to check his power.

Sa Yeon-hee bowed slightly and spoke,

“I apologize for coming unannounced, Leader.”

“Not at all. Sister has every right to seek me out at any time. So, what brings you here on such difficult terms?”

“I have a favor to ask of you.”

“A favor?” Yu Mun Sang’s eyes lit up.

“Yes! I hope you will grant it.”

“The way you’re asking, it sounds like a formidable request.”

“It shouldn’t be too difficult for you.”

“Tell me then. If it’s within my power, I will grant it.”

“I would like to join the forces being sent to the Dragon Heaven Valley.”

“You, sister?”

“Yes!”

At Sa Yeon-hee’s words, Yu Mun Sang involuntarily furrowed his brow. It was an utterly unexpected answer.

Yu Mun Sang looked at Sa Yeon-hee in silence for a moment.

Only after quite some time passed did he speak again.

“Are you serious?”

“I am!”

“Why would you insist on going to such a perilous place? That place isn’t suitable for you, sister.”

“I am a martial artist too. I want to contribute, even if it’s in a small way.”

“There will be other chances for you to earn merit. There’s no need for you to go there. Stay

here, sister.”

“Do you think I’m saying this because I want credit?”

Sa Yeon-hee looked straight at Yu Mun Sang.

Despite his piercing gaze, she did not so much as bat an eye.

Though the Sword Sect was nominally a powerless organization compared to the leader’s

authority, the weight of being its head was not light.

Even Yu Mun Sang couldn’t dismiss her request without a valid reason.

“Do you really have to go to Dragon Heaven Valley?”

“My request isn’t unreasonable, is it?”

“Very well! If you are so determined, go. But whatever happens, don’t regret or blame me.”

“Thank you, Leader.”

“I will talk to Woo Mun Pae so that you can join the group leaving the day after tomorrow.

“I will do that.”

“If you have nothing else, you may leave now. I would like to be alone.”

“Yes. Until we meet again, I wish you peace.”

Sa Yeon-hee bowed to Woo Mun Pae, then turned and walked away.

Yu Mun Sang watched her departing figure with a deeply contemplative gaze.

‘Sister.’

＊＊＊

Sa Yeon-hee felt the piercing gaze of Yu Mun Sang on her back.

She bit her lip hard.

Sa Yeon-hee knew very well how presumptuous her request had been. But she was desperate enough to risk discourtesy.

‘What is he plotting…’

As the head of the Sword Sect, she certainly had the right to attend the leadership meetings of the Martial Sword Alliance. Yet, Yu Mun Sang had deliberately excluded her from the meetings.

There had to be a hidden agenda.

Sa Yeon-hee suspected that Yu Mun Sang was behind the notorious bandit group in the Southern Seas, the Nine Shadows Fleet, several years ago.

Although the Nine Shadows Fleet had disbanded, which ended Yu Mun Sang’s connection, she had not let go of her suspicions.

‘It’s clear the Leader is up to something big.’

She was the head of the Sword Sect.

It was her responsibility to keep the Leader in check.

To do that, she needed to know what he was planning.

That was why she wanted to join the forces heading to the Dragon Heaven Valley.
