“There’s an awfully large number of them.”

Nam Woo-gyeong grumbled as he looked around the street filled with people.

As soon as the rumor spread that the Nine Dragons Clan was hosting a martial arts tournament, martial artists in the area flocked to the Nine Dragons Clan. Inn rooms were quickly sold out, and the streets were teeming with people.

For Nam Woo-gyeong, it wasn’t a particularly welcome situation. It meant there were that many more people he had to monitor.

As soon as the tournament was announced, Nam Woo-gyeong summoned personnel from nearby branches to keep an eye on key figures. Even so, they were struggling due to a lack of manpower.

For Nam Woo-gyeong, it was an unwelcome situation.

“Tsk!”

He clicked his tongue and moved on.

At that moment, he felt a sharp pain in his temple, as if pricked by a needle.

Nam Woo-gyeong knew well what this sensation meant. Someone was staring at him.

He turned his head to find the source of the gaze.

A man who appeared to be in his early to mid-thirties was looking at him with arms crossed.

He had a handsome appearance, as if painted with a brush, and exuded a naturally imposing aura that overwhelmed those around him.

As soon as he saw him, Nam Woo-gyeong unconsciously frowned.

“Eun Moo-young.”

“Long time no see, Woo-gyeong.”

“Haah!”

“Why didn’t you come to see me when you arrived in the Nine Dragons Clan?”

“Because we’re not in the kind of relationship where we check on each other’s well-being.”

“That’s disappointing. I thought we were at least close enough to contact each other when entering each other’s territory.”

“That’s just your assumption.”

Despite Nam Woo-gyeong’s words, Eun Moo-young didn’t show any sign of displeasure. Nam Woo-gyeong was notorious for getting under people’s skin, but it didn’t work on Eun Moo-young.

Soul-Calming Sword, Eun Moo-young.

He was the young master of the Nine Dragons Clan and the sole disciple of Gyeong Un-cheon.

He was one of the Ten Lesser Skies and one of the most prominent young martial artists in northern Jianghu.

Despite his handsome appearance, Eun Moo-young was famous for his resolute personality that never compromised once he designated someone as an enemy.

He had met Nam Woo-gyeong a few times in their youth.

Even then, they didn’t get along because of their opposite personalities, and regarded each other indifferently. That’s why, even though he had entered the Nine Dragons Clan, he hadn’t contacted Eun Moo-young and had been acting secretly.

“How did you know I was here?”

“You’re underestimating the Nine Dragons Clan. Do you think we’re so sloppy that we wouldn’t know if a person of interest like you entered our own territory?”

“Tsk! I guess I underestimated the Nine Dragons Clan.”

Nam Woo-gyeong clicked his tongue.

Eun Moo-young approached him.

“Follow me. I have something to discuss.”

“What do you want to talk about?”

“This isn’t a suitable place for a conversation. Let’s go somewhere quiet.”

“……”

“Think about your Hao Clan disciples. If our sect sets its mind to it, we could wipe out the Hao Clan here within half an hour.”

“Sigh! Fine.”

At Eun Moo-young’s threat, Nam Woo-gyeong reluctantly nodded.

Had he remained completely hidden, it might have been different, but since his presence had been detected by the Nine Dragons Clan, there was no safe place for him—at least not within the Nine Dragons Clan.

Nam Woo-gyeong followed Eun Moo-young into the Nine Dragons Clan.

Inside, countless people were bustling around to prepare for the martial arts tournament. They were setting up the stage and making preparations to showcase the might of the Nine Dragons Clan.

Eun Moo-young led Nam Woo-gyeong to the top of the fortress wall, where the Nine Dragons’ central training ground was clearly visible.

The scale of the Nine Dragons Clan was far more imposing than it appeared from the outside.

The maze-like layout would likely disorient any first-time visitor.

Eun Moo-young broke the silence.

“What do you think?”

“About what?”

“How does it compare to the Jade Heaven Alliance? You’d know better than most.”

“Do you want a flattering answer or an honest one?”

“The latter.”

“You won’t like it.”

“The difference is significant. It’s not about the size of the place.”

“Then what’s the issue?”

“The difference lies in the people and the purpose.”

At Nam Woo-gyeong’s answer, Eun Moo-young slightly furrowed his brow.

“So you’re saying we fall short of the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“The initial spirit of the Jade Heaven Alliance no longer exists. It’s faded and degenerated over a hundred years. But some things haven’t changed—the vast experience and knowledge they’ve accumulated. At the very least, the experience and the people who’ve accumulated it are something the Nine Dragons Clan can’t match. Over the past few decades, the Jade Heaven Alliance has faithfully strengthened its forces and trained martial artists to suit their purpose of dominating the Jianghu. Compared to that, the Nine Dragons Clan falls far short.”

Nam Woo-gyeong’s evaluation was harsh, even scathing. But there was almost no change in Eun Moo-young’s expression.

“If that’s your assessment, so be it. But there’s something you don’t know.”

“And what’s that?”

“That the Nine Dragons Clan’s strength isn’t limited to what is visible. Our hidden power is by no means inferior to the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“That could be true.”

“You don’t seem to believe me.”

“As you know, I’m a bit skeptical.”

“Well, that cautiousness is your greatest strength. I like that about you.”

“I don’t particularly like you.”

“That’s unavoidable. I can’t control your feelings.”

“Let’s cut the pointless talk and get to the main issue. What exactly do you want to say?”

Nam Woo-gyeong glared at Eun Moo-young.

For a moment, a silence fell between them.

They stared at each other as if they would devour one another.

In the tense atmosphere, it was Eun Moo-young who spoke first.

“Help us. The Nine Dragons Clan needs the Hao Clan’s assistance.”

“You’re aware of our sect’s policy.”

“You mean, to remain neutral?”

“Exactly! For many years, our sect has maintained neutrality. If we hadn’t, we would have been destroyed long ago by attacks from other sects.”

The Hao Clan basically walks the middle path.

They collect and sell information and rarely take sides with any particular sect. The reason they refused to help Lim So-bo when she requested assistance in the past was also because of that.

They did collaborate with the Lim siblings later, but that was a very exceptional case. In the end, the collaboration was canceled after the Lim siblings left the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Eun Moo-young’s gaze at Nam Woo-gyeong was cold.

“Don’t you realize? In times of chaos like now, neutrality doesn’t work. It’s called neutrality, but in reality, isn’t it just maintaining an ambiguous stance and walking a tightrope?”

“So what?”

“It may have worked until now, but it won’t in the future. If you don’t make your stance clear, you’ll incur the wrath of both sides.”

“Are you threatening me?”

Nam Woo-gyeong glared at Eun Moo-young with a fierce look. But Eun Moo-young calmly replied without blinking.

“You can think of it that way.”

“Moo-young!”

“Help our sect. If you don’t, I can’t guarantee the safety of the Hao Clan disciples in the Nine Dragons Clan.”

“No one has ever dared to threaten our sect. Not even your master would say such a thing.”

“Is that a refusal?”

“It is.”

“Won’t you regret it?”

“You should be the one not to regret it.”

“Hmph! I guess there’s no choice.”

Eun Moo-young’s eyes turned cold.

Lee Gwak had a puzzled expression.

It was because of the sudden visit from the Hao Clan’s branch leader.

He was the one he had seen drinking with Nam Woo-gyeong last night. He was the head of the Hao clan’s branch of the Nine Dragons clan and had brought jars of liquor several times. So Lee Gwak remembered his face clearly.

Finding it hard to believe, Lee Gwak asked.

“So you’re saying that Brother Woo-gyeong has gone missing?”

“Yes. He suddenly disappeared this afternoon.”

“Isn’t it possible he went out somewhere? He’s known to come and go as he pleases.”

“Of course, that’s possible. But our young master never leaves the area during a mission. Even if he steps out, he always tells us his destination.”

“……”

“We are sure that something has happened to our young master. Please help us, Master Lee.

“If there is any sect capable of kidnapping or harming Brother Woo-gyeong without catching the attention of the Hao Clan…”

Lee Gwak’s gaze drifted towards the ochre-colored castle at the center of the Nine Dragons Nest. The massive fortress filled his view, its appearance made even more imposing by the setting sun.

“It can only be the Nine Dragons Clan.”

“We think so too. That’s why we’re trying to contact our people in the Nine Dragons Clan, but for some reason there’s no response.”

A dark shadow fell across the branch leader’s face.

Even though the Nine Dragons Clan was the most prestigious sect in the world, they still needed servants and errand boys to do their chores. Some of them belonged to the Hao Clan.

They were sent by the Hao Clan to gather information from within the Nine Dragons Clan.

They became the eyes and ears of the Hao Clan, conveying news from inside the Nine Dragons Clan. Even trivial information was welcome. Such small pieces of information accumulate to form the background of a bigger picture.

But since this afternoon, contact with them had been completely cut off. It was evidence that something had gone wrong inside the Nine Dragons Clan.

“It’s possible that our branch has been compromised. So I’ve ordered all external activities to be suspended.”

“You did well.”

“If our young master is trapped somewhere, the Nine Dragons Clan is the most likely place. Within the Nine Dragons Nest, the only place that can avoid our sect’s eyes is currently the Nine Dragons Clan. Please rescue our young master.”

“I understand.”

Lee Gwak replied without a moment’s hesitation.

Nam Woo-gyeong was one of the few people he cherished. Knowing that he was in danger, he couldn’t just ignore it.

“First, I need to enter the Nine Dragons Clan.”

Just in time, the Nine Dragons Clan was hosting a martial arts tournament.

They will open their gates themselves and accept countless martial artists.

Lee Gwak looked at Lee Cheong.

“Cheong-ah! I have a favor to ask.”

“Yes, Dad.”

“Could you participate in the martial arts tournament?”

“I will.”

Lee Cheong answered energetically.

He had grasped the situation from the conversation between Lee Gwak and the branch leader.

Lee Cheong already knew what he needed to do.

Lee Gwak stroked his head.

“I’m sorry to ask you to do something difficult.”

“It’s okay. Don’t worry, Dad. I can do it well.”

Lee Cheong replied maturely.

Although Lee Gwak knew that his child was far more thoughtful and mature than others of the same age, he still couldn’t help but feel uneasy.

But there was no choice now.

He needed to find out where Nam Woo-gyeong was and rescue him as soon as possible. To do that, he required someone to buy him time.

He felt uneasy about making his son do such a difficult task, but there was no other way.

“I suppose I’ll have to reassess your martial arts skills. Let’s go.”

“Yes, Father!”

Lee Gwak led Lee Cheong to the training yard within the Hao Clan’s safe house.

The training ground was just a slightly larger courtyard. But thanks to the high walls, they were free from outside eyes.

Even without being told, Lee Cheong picked up his sword and walked to the center of the training ground.

Bang!

With a powerful step, he began the Eight Sects Sword Art.

Starting with Straight Sword Piercing Mountains, the eight forms of the Eight Sects Sword Art unfolded one after another.

Among them, Lee Cheong could confidently execute only the first three moves. These three moves were so familiar to him that he could perform them even with his eyes closed.
