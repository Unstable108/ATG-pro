In the end, Seok Yi-cheon failed to catch a single fish.

No matter how many times he changed the bait, it was useless.

Eventually, he gave up.

Lee Gwak patted the dejected Seok Yi-cheon on the shoulder and returned to the guesthouse.

“Oh! You brought fish, that’s great. I can make ‘Boiled Water Fish’ with this.”

Boiled Water Fish was a dish in which the fish was cut into slices, lightly fried in oil, and then boiled with various seasonings.

Bang Ye-in quickly snatched the fish Lee Gwak had caught and hurried into the kitchen.

Before long, the sound of sizzling and the rich aroma of cooking filled the air.

Lee Gwak and Seok Yi-cheon sat down and waited for Bang Ye-in to finish cooking.

“You’re up already? Very diligent.”

Just then, Bang Ju-gwang walked out, wearing an apron.

You’re already up?” Lee Gwak asked politely.

“Did you sleep well?” Seok Yi-cheon chimed in simultaneously.

In response to their question. Bang Ju-gwang answered politely.

“Thanks to both of you, I slept very well.”

“Did you two sleep comfortably? The bedding must’ve been rough.”

“Not at all. We slept fine.”

“Good to hear. Since Ye-in’s already in the kitchen, I can take it easy for a bit.”

Bang Ju-gwang casually sat down next to Lee Gwak.

He looked at Lee Gwak and asked,

“So, what do you plan to do now?”

“I’m not sure.”

Lee Gwak answered honestly.

His reason for coming here had vanished when the gathering fell through. Having lost his objective, he did not even know which direction to head in next.

Bang Ju-gwang looked at him with quiet, thoughtful eyes.

“May I offer you some advice?”

“Yes, please.”

“You’re aware of the ‘Dragon Gate’ aren’t you?”

“Yes, I am.”

The Dragon Gate was a gorge located between Hejin in Shanxi Province and Hancheng in Shaanxi Province.

The current there was so swift and treacherous that no matter how large a fish was, it could not swim upstream. Yet legend said that once a fish managed to make it upstream, it would become a dragon. Hence the name, “Dragon Gate.”

“……”

Lee Gwak listened with a slight frown.

“You are a dragon among men. A rare talent in this world.”

“I…”

“I know you don’t like hearing such praise. But as someone who’s lived longer than you, I’d appreciate it if you heard me out.”

“Of course.”

“You may not realize it, but your influence on the Jianghu is greater than you think. Few your age possess such strength. Moreover, you achieved it alone, without relying on any sect. That in itself is remarkable. In all my years running this inn, I’ve never seen someone like you—a lone force with such impact. But that’s all there is. You’re extraordinary, yet something is missing.”

“What is it?”

“You already know. A clear purpose—a sense of direction. You lack that.”

Lee Gwak nodded silently.

Not long ago, he had thought the same.

People like Go Geom-wol and other prodigies had received systematic training from childhood and had formed their own philosophies early on. That’s why they had clear goals.

But Lee Gwak had none of that.

All he wanted was inner peace and a happy life with his family. He desired nothing beyond that.

Without grand ambitions, he saw no need for a greater purpose.

Had he remained on Mount Qilian, he wouldn’t have had to worry about such things. But the world dragged him into the Jianghu against his will.

Now, whether he liked it or not, he had become a figure of great influence.

Even if he chose to withdraw into seclusion now, Jianghu would not leave him in peace.

Whether he liked it or not, he would have to reach some resolution within the current state of affairs in the Jianghu.

But to do that, he first needed to define his purpose and direction

.

“You are a dragon, but you lack your dragon’s pearl. That’s why you’re swept along by the tides, unable to command your own fate.”

“My Dragon’s Pearl?”

“Yes, It’s the one missing element you need—someone who can give you the sense of purpose and direction you lack. That person, for you, is a dragon’s pearl.”

“That Sounds Difficult.”

“Not at all. You just need to find such a person.”

Bang Ju-gwang clicked his tongue.

In his eyes, the biggest problem with Lee Gwak was his humility and his tendency to think too little of himself.

In peaceful times, such traits could be virtues, but in these chaotic times, they just served as unnecessary hindrances.

Lee Gwak needed to become more self-centered and decisive.

There were plenty of people who would follow him.

“Even Yein is following you, is she not?”

Some might dismiss her as just a cook’s daughter, but in truth, Bang Ye-in was sharper and more perceptive than most of the so-called “prodigies” in the Jianghu.

Every few years, the Bang Clan’s inn would host a gathering of the heads of the Thousand Kingdom School, Sky High Castle, and the Myriad Merchant Troupe. These were some of the greatest martial artists in the Jianghu, individuals of unparalleled skill and knowledge.

From a young age, Bang Ye-in had grown up watching such people come and go.

Some had even liked her enough to teach her martial arts techniques.

She had practically grown up around the very best the Jianghu had to offer, so she had a keen eye for recognizing people’s true worth. As a result, she tended not to acknowledge anyone who did not measure up to her standards.

Yet she acknowledged and followed Lee Gwak.

If he were ordinary, she wouldn’t have stayed by his side.

And it wasn’t just her.

Cheol Gwang-woo, Cheon Wol, Sa Yeon-hee, Mok Seon-wol—everyone connected to him was extraordinary.

The foundation was already there.

All he needed was the Dragon’s Pearl.

Bang Ju-gwang continued,

“Go to the Sky High Castle and bring out So-bo. She’s too great a talent for them to keep.”

“What?”

Lee Gwak’s eyes widened in shock.

The suggestion was completely unexpected.

“I’ve seen So-bo a few times since she was a child. Though she relies too much on her master, Yeo Jung-wol, her potential is unmatched in this world.”

“But So-bo is part of Sky High Castle and the Thousand Kingdom School.”

“Didn’t I say it? The Sky High Castle doesn’t utilize her talent at all. Personally, I respect Elder Po, but he’s not the right leader for these turbulent times.”

“He’s a proud man who has now been defeated by Ja Hong-cheon and the First Sword of Wudang. After such a blow, he’ll likely retreat even further within himself and close the gates of Sky High Castle rather than get involved in the chaos. So-bo won’t have a chance to flourish there.”

Having observed Po Cheon-wol for years, Bang Ju-gwang knew his temperament well.

Po Cheon-wol lacked the ambition to navigate troubled times. Someone like Lim So-bo was wasted on him.

After this incident, Lim So-bo’s opportunities would only shrink further.

“So-bo was never truly one of them. She was only there temporarily. If she’s willing, taking her away won’t be an issue. The Thousand Kingdom School might object, but I can speak to Elder Namgung. He’s reasonable.”

“Hmm.”

Lee Gwak let out a thoughtful hum.

“Since you’re here, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to meet So-bo. There’s no guarantee she’ll follow you, but at least talk to her first.”

“Understood.”

The distance from here to Heavenly High Castle on Mount Okhwa wasn’t far. If he decided to go, it wouldn’t be difficult.

Bang Ju-gwang looked at Lee Gwak with a mixture of sympathy and concern.

“It will be difficult. After all, this wasn’t the path you originally wanted. But someone needs to have the resolve to bring these chaotic times to an end. Perhaps this is the ‘will from heaven’ that has been given to you.”

Lee Gwak said nothing.

As he clenched his lips in silence, Bang Ju-gwang was reminded of another martial artist.

‘He was the same.’

A century ago, a man had ended the Great Heavenly Blood War.

He, too, was like Lee Gwak—uninterested in power. Yet fate pulled him to the center of the Jianghu, where he ultimately brought an end to the chaos.

Only later did he realize it was his destiny.

Bang Ju-gwang believed Lee Gwak was similar.

Seok Yi-cheon, suffocated by the heavy atmosphere, couldn’t bring himself to speak.

‘I can’t breathe!’

If even he, who had nothing to do with it, was suffocating like this, he didn’t dare to imagine how much pressure Lee Gwak must be feeling.

Just then—

“Why’s the mood so heavy?”

Bang Ye-in came out of the kitchen with a tray of food.

Bang Ju-gwang smiled.

“It’s nothing.”

“Really?”

“Did you make Boiled Water Fish?”

“Gwak oraboni caught a fish earlier.”

“It smells wonderful. You’ve really mastered it. You could take over the inn now.”

“I still prefer my freedom.”

“Tsk! You’ve seen enough of the world. Isn’t it time to settle down and inherit the family business?”

“No thanks. Stop wasting your breath and just eat.”

Bang Ye-in shoved the tray at Bang Ju-gwang, who chuckled wryly and set the dishes on the table.

Meanwhile, Cheol Gwang-woo also took a seat.

“Let’s eat!”

His booming voice echoed through the inn.

Mount Okhwa

As Cheon Wol climbed Mount Okhwa, his steps felt heavier than ever.

He had climbed this path hundreds of times.

Every pebble on the ground, every swaying branch was familiar. Yet today, the mountain felt strangely foreign.

It wasn’t the scenery that had changed—it was the weight on his shoulders.

“Haaah…”

Cheon Wol sighed deeply.

The Sky High Castle was just ahead.

The closer he got, the tighter his chest felt, as if a boulder pressed down on him.

Part of him wanted to delay his arrival as long as possible.

Forcing himself forward, he continued climbing until a massive fortress came into view.

One of the Seven Great Sects—the Sky High Castle.

“Stop!”

As Cheon Wol approached, guards stopped him. He handed over his identification.

“Cheon Wol of the Cavalry Division. I’ve come to see the strategist.”

His identity as Lim So-bo’s hidden blade was a closely guarded secret—critical to her safety.

To protect her, Lim So-bo had given him a false identity as a member of the Cavalry Division.

The Sky High Castle consisted of six major divisions, with the Cavalry Division being the largest, making it easy to fabricate his affiliation.

“Proceed.”

The guards let him pass without suspicion.

Once inside, Cheon Wol hurried to Lim So-bo’s quarters.

“Brother!”

When Lim So-bo heard of his arrival, she ran out barefoot. Her face was filled with anticipation.

“Where is Master?”

“What’s wrong? Where is he?”

Sensing unease, Lim Sobo’s voice slightly trembled. But she tried hard to keep her composure.

Cheon Wol couldn’t meet her eyes and lowered his head.

Lim So-bo’s eyes trembled.

She bit down on her lip so hard she nearly drew blood.

“Brother…?”

“I’m sorry.”

“You’re lying…?”

“The strategist… took his own life.”

“No… Why?”

“It’s my fault. I was a burden…”

Cheon Wol couldn’t continue.

Seeing his bloodshot eyes, Lim So-bo’s tears spilled over.

“H-Huuuuk!”

A sob escaped her.

Cheon Wol closed his eyes.

“I’m sorry. It’s all because of me.”

“H-Heoook!”

Lim So-bo collapsed into Cheon Wol’s chest, weeping uncontrollably.

Her cries tore at his heart.

Her crying only stopped after she had completely exhausted herself and collapsed.
