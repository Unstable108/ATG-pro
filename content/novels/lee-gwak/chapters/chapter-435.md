“Whew!”

Coming out of his quarters for the first time in a long while, Lee Gwak took a deep breath.

A look of relief spread across his face.

In his hand were three yellow booklets.

The blood and sweat he had poured into the past few months were contained in these three booklets.

One Pillar Heart Art.

Eight Paths Thunder Step.

Eight Paths Blade and Sword Technique.

These were the martial arts techniques he had painstakingly created over the last several months.

The One Pillar Heart Art was the foundational internal energy technique, like erecting a single grand pillar, it was designed to serve as the core upon which all other martial arts could be built, while maintaining high expandability. Though it began with just the One Pillar Heart Art, Lee Gwak planned to create advanced variants based on it in the future.

The Eight Paths Thunder Step was a movement technique. Though it started with only eight variations, it was designed to be expanded once a martial artist reached a certain level of proficiency. Lee Gwak had created it with scalability in mind from the beginning.

Lastly, the Eight Paths Blade and Sword Technique was a combat method meant to be practiced alongside the Thunder Step.

Lee Gwak made his way to the Heaven Reaching Pavilion.

The Heaven Reaching Pavilion was where the core members of the intelligence network—originally from the Jade Heaven Alliance—conducted their work. It used to be known as the Military Affairs Office, but more recently, Lim Sobo had formalized the name as the Heaven Reaching Pavilion.

“Sect Master!”

“You’ve finally come out, Sect Master!”

Disciples greeted him enthusiastically along the way.

Lee Gwak returned each greeting as he continued on his path.

“Master!”

Just before entering the Heaven Reaching Pavilion, a boy and a girl around sixteen ran toward him.

Only two people in the Mad Martial Sect would call Lee Gwak “Master”: Pi Jin-ui and Jo So-hye.

The two orphans he had saved and taken in as disciples no longer bore any trace of their former ragged appearances. They now carried themselves with the dignified and striking looks befitting young martial artists of any respectable sect.

“Have you been well?”

“Yes!”

Pi Jin-ui and Jo So-hye answered in unison.

Lee Gwak gazed at them warmly for a moment before speaking.

“Come with me.”

“Us too?”

“Yes. Sooner or later, you’ll both need to be involved in the sect’s operations. It’s good to start learning early.”

“Yes!”

Excitement flickered across their faces.

Only those recognized by Lee Gwak or the leadership of Mad Martial Sect were allowed to enter the Heaven Reaching Pavilion. Even being his disciples didn’t grant them access until now.

After all, they were still newcomers to martial training, barely fledglings.

Heading to the Heaven Reaching Pavilion now filled them with anticipation.

Lee Gwak entered the building with the two in tow.

Inside, Lim Sobo, Lim Ji-mun, Cheong Un-san, Cheol Gwang-woo, and Cheon Wol were waiting for him.

“You’re finally back out.”

“We thought our necks would stretch from waiting.”

“What took you so long?”

Each greeted him with a mix of relief and complaints.

Just moments ago, the mood had been heavy. But Lee Gwak’s presence alone was enough to soften the tension.

Cheol Gwang-woo asked, “Any results?”

Thump!

Rather than answering, Lee Gwak placed the three martial arts manuals on the table.

Lim Sobo’s eyes trembled slightly.

“One Pillar Heart Art, Eight Paths Thunder Step, Eight Paths Blade and Sword Technique. The mad martial sect finally has its own unique martial arts.”

Her eyes filled with emotion.

For any proper sect, having its own unique martial arts was a given. Now, the Mad Martial Sect has taken that step.

It meant they finally had roots.

Others might not understand the significance, but for someone like Lim Sobo, who managed the sect’s inner workings, this was a moving moment.

Having their own techniques meant they could train disciples and strengthen their forces. More importantly, shared training fostered a powerful bond among disciples.

“Well done, Master!”

Cheong Un-san looked at Lee Gwak with admiration.

‘He has truly reached the level of a grandmaster.’

Pi Jin-ui and Jo So-hye had already been learning martial arts created by Lee Gwak, but those were advanced techniques unsuitable for widespread teaching.

The new manuals, however, were basic-level martial arts anyone could learn.

Creating such foundational but expandable techniques was, in fact, more difficult than crafting high-level arts.

Only a martial artist who had reached the absolute realm could accomplish such a feat.

Cheong Un-san was overjoyed that Lee Gwak had achieved this level.

“For now, these are just the basics,” Lee Gwak said. “Teach them to the new recruits and lower-tier warriors.”

“Understood.”

Lee Gwak then turned to Pi Jin-ui and Jo So-hye

“You two will learn these arts first. They share similarities with what I’ve already taught you, so it shouldn’t be difficult.”

“Yes!”

“Once you’ve mastered them, you’ll teach the younger disciples.”

“Us? Can we really?”

“You’ve trained hard. You’re more than capable. Besides, the children already look up to you like older siblings. It won’t be too difficult.”

Lee Gwak’s confident tone reassured them.

Having been saved by him, both held unwavering faith in his words.

“We’ll do our best!”

“We won’t let you down, Master!”

They clenched their fists in determination.

Lee Gwak smiled briefly before addressing Cheol Gwang-woo.

“Gwang-woo.”

“Yes, Brother!”

“Make copies and teach the other disciples.”

“So you want me to be a martial instructor?”

“That’s right. I’m counting on you.”

“Heh heh! Gladly!”

Cheol Gwang-woo agreed without hesitation.

He had been growing restless with nothing to do besides his own training. Though he was unsure if he would be a good teacher, he was eager to contribute.

“Thank you.”

“No need for thanks! Heh heh!”

Cheol Gwang-woo grinned, though he looked somewhat intimidating.

Lim Ji-mun muttered under his breath,

“The disciples under that guy are doomed. Of all people, why him?”

“What did you say?”

“Oh! You heard? I meant it as a compliment. Don’t get mad.”

“Hmph! You’ll pay for that later.”

Cheol Gwang-woo snorted and glared at him.

Lim Ji-mun just winked back.

Lim Sobo shook her head at the sight of the two bickering like cats and dogs.

They were around the same age and often quarreled, but then got along again as if nothing had happened.

Lim Sobo sighed, exasperated.

“If you’re going to fight, take it outside. But if I hear even a whisper of a scuffle, there’ll be consequences.”

“Yes, ma’am!”

“Sis, when have we ever fought? We’re the best of friends! Heh heh!”

They immediately threw their arms around each other’s shoulders, pretending nothing had happened.

Lee Gwak turned his gaze to Cheon Wol.

Even though it had been a while since Lee Gwak had entered, Cheon-wol hadn’t said a single word. He seemed to have become more reserved and sombre.

Lee Gwak could sense his martial arts had improved, he could notice the heightened aura around him.

When their eyes met, Cheon Wol gave a slight nod.

That alone was enough.

Words were unnecessary between them.

Lee Gwak trusted Cheon Wol, and Cheon Wol was faithful to him.

Lee Gwak looked at Lim Sobo.

“Has anything happened while I was away?”

“Of course. A major storm hit.”

“What do you mean?”

“The merchant king is dead”

“Merchant king? You mean Myriad Merchant Troupe’s leader?”

“Yes.”

“How?”

“Ja Hong-cheon tracked down and killed him. The entire Jianghu is in uproar.”

Lee Gwak blinked.

It was hard to believe, but Lim Sobo had no reason to lie.

“Ja Hong-cheon really killed the Supreme Lord?”

“It’s confirmed.”

“Hm.”

“Thankfully, Lord Eun Il-myeong wasn’t with him and avoided harm. Had he died too, the Myriad Merchant Troupe would have been ruined.”

“So the Myriad Merchant Troupe’s activities will decline?”

“They’ll have no choice. Many sects supported by the Myriad Merchant Troupe—like the Nine Dragons Sect or Wudang—will be affected. They relied heavily on the Myriad Merchant Troupe’s funding.”

“Hm.”

“Ja Hong-cheon is a terrifying man. With a single move, he delivered a devastating blow to the Jianghu.”

A chill ran down Lim Sobo’s spine.

Eun Il-myeong, the young master of the troupe, was certainly capable. Like his father, Eun Won-ho, he was smart and ambitious.

If given a little more time, he could have managed the Myriad Merchant Troupe well. Maybe even expanded it further than before. But he was still young and lacked many things compared to his father.

It would take years of hardship to fill the gap left by Eun Won-ho. In the meantime, the sects that depended on Myriad Merchant Troupe’s support would inevitably shrink in activity.

By killing Eun Won-ho, Ja Hong-cheon had effectively paralyzed not only the Myriad Merchant Troupe but also the sects associated with them.

It was truly a terrifying plan and execution.

“Has Ja Hong-cheon returned to the Alliance?”

“That’s unclear. He vanished after the assassination.”

Even with all their resources, including the Hao Clan, Lim Sobo couldn’t track him.

“No leads at all?”

“Not yet. But we’re doing everything we can. We’ll find him.”

Lee Gwak furrowed his brow.

The death of Eun Won-ho was shocking, but what unsettled him more was Ja Hong-cheon’s direct involvement.

The Ja Hong-cheon he knew never acted recklessly.

Even when he could easily achieve his goals by moving personally, he preferred to delegate.

As the leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance, it made sense, his role was to command, not fight. But Ja Hong-cheon’s caution bordered on paranoia.

He never acted without careful consideration.

That man wouldn’t act solely to eliminate Eun Wonho.

“There must be something else he’s after.

Lee Gwak’s expression grew serious.

So did the faces of Lim Sobo and Cheong Un-san.

They had tried their best to determine Ja Hong-cheon’s intentions, but so far, they had uncovered nothing.

Lee Gwak said, “We need to uncover Ja Hongcheon’s true goal. He’ll strike again.”

“Our strategists are working on it. We’ll have answers soon. Please give us a little more time.”

“Understood.”

Lim Sobo turned to the gathered leadership,

“Now that our Sect Master has brought forth results, we must also move swiftly. We must raise elite martial artists as soon as possible and turn our sect into an impregnable fortress. Everyone, carry out your assigned duties thoroughly.”

“Yes, Strategist!”

“We will obey.”
