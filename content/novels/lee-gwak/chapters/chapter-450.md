The Lotus Pavilion of the Celestial Demon Troupe was always silent.

This was because the lord of the Troupe, Go Geom-wol disliked anything flashy or noisy.

Aside from a few guards, no one was allowed near the pavilion.

Sllrp!

A man was sipping tea at the grand tea table in the middle of the Lotus Pavilion.

With an intoxicating, almost otherworldly decadence, the man was none other than Go Geom-wol, the Supreme Master of the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Go Geom-wol sipped his tea with half-closed eyes, while across from him sat the Saintess, Gu Mun-hye, also savoring the tea with a similar expression.

But between the two of them was a young boy with a bewildered expression.

He was around ten years old.

The boy’s eyes were less like those of a human and more like those of a starving beast, a beast so famished that its hunger had turned into venom.

Yet, at this moment, the boy wore a bewildered expression.

The reason?

Go Geom-wol and Gu Mun-hye sat in silence, leaving him awkwardly in the middle.

The boy was Jang Cheon-hwa, whom Go Geom-wol had taken in as a disciple.

Jang Cheon-hwa had already received all the foundational teachings from Yang Gwang-baek, the Lord of the True Demon Hall and leader of the Ten Blood Demons.

Yang Gwang-baek’s training had been excruciating, but it had forged Jang Cheon-hwa into a resilient martial artist with a flawless martial foundation.

Of course, reaching that point required blood, sweat, and enduring pain beyond what most humans could bear.

An ordinary child would have collapsed and given up within a day under Yang Gwang-baek’s tutelage. But Jang Cheon-hwa clung on like a vengeful spirit, enduring every torment until he emerged victorious.

As a result, his body underwent a perfect transformation, becoming the ideal vessel for martial arts. Though he had already been exceptionally talented, training under Yang Gwang-baek elevated him to a new level.

Jang Cheon-hwa had endured Yang Gwang-baek’s brutal training with sheer tenacity.

But even he couldn’t help but turn docile in front of Go Geom-wol.

Yang Gwang-baek was terrifying, but Go Geom-wol exuded an authority that was simply untouchable.

It was as if he embodied what a true absolute being should be.

That overwhelming presence made Jang Cheon-hwa’s body stiffen uncontrollably. But only for a while.

After a while, Jang Cheon-hwa’s whole body started itching terribly.

Tap.

At that moment, Go Geom-wol set down his teacup and opened his eyes.

Startled, Jang Cheon-hwa flinched.

Seeing this, Gu Mun-hye smiled faintly. The way the boy nervously glanced between them was rather cute.

Go Geom-wol finally spoke.

“As you can see, this boy is like this. I’d like you to teach him for the time being.”

“Hoho! You keep pushing your disciple onto others instead of teaching him yourself.”

“His foundation is still weak, and there’s too much to teach.”

“Shirking your responsibilities onto others isn’t a good habit.”

“I’ll be quite busy from now on, so I have no choice.”

At Go Geom-wol’s words, Gu Mun-hye’s expression hardened.

“Are you really planning to wage war again?”

“It has already begun.”

“By now, Yang Soo-mun should have begun the attack on Siege Fortress.”

“That’s…”

Gu Mun-hye gasped in shock.

“I apologize for acting without discussing such a major matter with you. But my instinct tells me that if we don’t act now, it’ll be too late.”

“Sigh. I understand. Running the Celestial Demon Troupe is ultimately your responsibility. But please, give me some warning next time. I’d like to avoid any more surprises.”

“I’ll try.”

“This is because of the Jade Heaven Alliance, isn’t it?”

“Yes. With Ja Hong-cheon dividing the Jianghu, this may be our only chance. If we miss this opportunity, we may never return to the Central Plains.”

Go Geom-wol’s eyes gleamed coldly.

Everything had its timing.

The perfect moment was like a mirage in the desert. It appears briefly and then vanishes. Once lost, who knew when it would come again?

“Must we really return to the Jianghu? Can’t we just live here in peace? We’ve lived contentedly for the past hundred years.”

“I wish that were possible. But if we remain here, we have no future.”

“Sigh…”

Gu Mun-hye sighed softly.

Even without Go Geom-wol saying it, she understood it better than anyone.

She was the Saintess.

She had a vague ability to glimpse the future.

For some time now, the future of Celestial Demon Troupe had been shrouded in dark clouds. If things didn’t change, the Troupe was destined to fall.

But knowing something intellectually and accepting it emotionally were two very different things. She had hoped to avoid war, but she knew that once Go Geom-wol made a decision, he would never waver.

He must have thought over it countless times.

It was not a decision made on a whim.

She could see the weight of his burden in his somber face.

Her eyes trembled for a moment.

“I can’t see…”

Although not perfectly clear, Gu Mun-hye could usually glimpse parts of someone’s future when she focused. But for some time now, Go Geom-wol’s future had become completely veiled. That only made her more anxious.

Whether he understood her fears or not, Go Geom-wol continued nonchalantly.

“The longer the war drags on, the worse it is for us. We must destroy the Jade Heaven Alliance and secure territory in the Central Plains as quickly as possible.”

“A lightning-fast assault, then?”

“Exactly. Our elite troops are already moving toward the Jianghu.”

Aside from those attacking Siege Fortress, most of Celestial Demon Troupe’s forces had already dispersed across the land.

Gu Mun-hye’s expression darkened.

‘He’s chosen a fight with no retreat.’

The previous leader of the Celestial Demon Troupe had always left this place as a last resort, prepared to retreat if they lost the war with the Jianghu.

But not Go Geom-wol.

He intended to stake everything on this war.

If they lost, he would rather bury his bones in the Central Plains.

Of course, he had no intention of losing.

“In the end, the outcome of this war will hinge on the showdown between me and him.”

“Him… you mean Lee Gwak?”

“Incredible, isn’t he? A third-rate martial artist with nothing, who grew strong enough to stand equal to Ja Hong-cheon, the master of the Jianghu.”

Go Geom-wol’s gaze shifted toward Jang Cheon-hwa, who was eagerly listening.

Jang Cheon-hwa’s face flushed red.

The idea of Celestial Demon Troupe going to war with the Jianghu thrilled the boy.

Go Geom-wol said to his disciple:

“Lee Gwak. Remember that name.”

“L-Lee Gwak?”

“He’ll be standing at the end of the road I’m walking. If you were to follow me, you will inevitably face him one day.”

“You’ve finally returned.”

Lee Gwak’s eyes filled with emotion.

Far in the distance, he could see the Mad Martial Sect.

In the few months he had been away, the sect had undergone many changes. The most noticeable was the expansion of the dock, which could now accommodate over a dozen large ships at once.

There were many workers at the dock, loading and unloading cargo.

Their lively faces reflected the current optimistic atmosphere of Mad Martial Sect.

Thud!

Lee Gwak’s ship finally reached the dock.

He offered the boatman a polite bow and got off the boat. Several nearby martial artists who recognized him quickly approached him.

“Isn’t that the Lord?”

“The Lord has returned!”

At the sound of their voices, everyone nearby turned to look. Some were seeing Lee Gwak for the first time.

“That’s the great warrior?”

“He’s so young, and he’s contending for the title of the strongest under heaven? Amazing.”

They looked at Lee Gwak with admiration.

The new faces belonged to merchants and traders visiting the sect for business.

Word of his return soon spread inside the fortress. The leadership rushed out to greet him.

At the forefront were Lim Sobo and Cheong Unsan.

Their faces looked pale, worn from the burdens they’d carried.

“Brother!”

“You’ve finally returned.”

Their faces were filled with joy.

They had felt his absence keenly, making his return even more welcome.

Though they had managed the Mad Martial Sect without issue, his absence had affected morale. There were even disturbing rumors from the Hao clan suggesting that Lee Gwak had been seriously wounded in a battle with Ja Hong-cheon and would need months to recover.

While the Hao clan continued to send updates, seeing him in person brought true relief.

Lee Gwak smiled at them.

“Have you all been well?”

“Thanks to you, Lord, we’ve been fine.”

The leadership replied in unison.

As Lee Gwak began walking inside, he spoke:

“Let’s discuss the details indoors.”

“Yes, Lord.”

The leadership followed him closely.

Dozens of martial artists followed behind, forming an impressive procession.

The pride on the faces of the warriors escorting him was unmistakable.

Though the Sect was relatively new, Lee Gwak’s presence had already elevated it to one of the most respected factions in the martial world. Especially after word spread of his duel with Ja Hong-cheon, the number of visitors had soared.

As they walked, Lee Gwak turned to Im Sobo.

“You must have struggled in my absence.”

“You struggled far more, Lord.”

This was an official setting, so she addressed him formally.

Lim Sobo had overseen the disciples and taken on all responsibilities while he was gone. Though she hadn’t had a day’s rest, the sense of accomplishment made it all worthwhile.

“You must be tired after your journey. Please rest today. We’ll handle the reports tomorrow.”

“I’m not that tired. I’d rather hear the reports now.”

“We have guests.”

“Guests?”

“Yes. Some very welcome ones. Spend time with them first today.”

She smiled softly.

“Who is it?”

“You’ll see.”

She avoided answering and gently nudged him into his quarters.

“Hey now…”

Lee Gwak’s eyes widened when he was pushed inside and saw the people waiting for him.

Standing there, holding the hands of two children, was Han So-cheon.

Their faces sent a tremor through Lee Gwak’s pupils.

“So… Cheon, Soo-ah, Cheong!”

It was Han So-cheon and the children.

Lee Gwak spread his arms and walked towards them.

“Oraboni!”

“Dad!”

Han So-cheon and the children rushed to meet him.

Thud!

They embraced tightly.

Han So-cheon’s eyebrows trembled slightly.

After so long in Lee Gwak’s arms, the hardships of the past months melted away like snow.

Lee Soo-ah burst into tears.

“Waaah! Dad!”

No matter how mature she acted, Lee Soo-ah was still just a child.

She was at an age where she still longed for her father’s embrace.

The moment she saw Lee Gwak, she sobbed uncontrollably.

She cried so pitifully that even Lee Cheong, also in Lee Gwak’s arms, looked embarrassed.

But Lee Cheong was just as happy to see him.

Though he didn’t show it as openly as Lee Soo-ah, he couldn’t hide his excitement either.

Lee Gwak stroked their heads gently.

As he did, his gaze remained fixed on Han So-cheon.

“When did you arrive?”

“A month ago.”

“The journey must have been difficult. Was it hard?”

“Not at all.”

Han So-cheon shook her head softly.

Though the road to Mad Martial Sect had been long, she hadn’t found it the least bit exhausting.

What had truly been painful was hearing the news that Lee Gwak had suffered severe injuries in his battle against Ja Hong-cheon.

The helplessness of being so far away, unable to do anything for the one she loved—that had been her real torment.

As she looked at Lee Gwak now, Han So-cheon made a silent vow.

‘From now on, I’ll share your burdens.’
