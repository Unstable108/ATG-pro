Yong Cheon Myeong frowned as he looked at the red envelope laid out on the table before him.

It was an invitation meant for the leaders of the Ten Sects.

The invitation was ready, but the problem was whose hands it should be delivered by.

The masters of the Ten Sects were the absolute rulers of the Jianghu. It was doubtful that they would even bother to come to the Jade Heaven Alliance with such an invitation.

The command of the Jade Heaven Alliance’s leader, Ja Hong Cheon, wasn’t to send out mere invitations. It was to bring the lords of the Ten Sects to the Jade Heaven Alliance at any cost.

At that moment, a young man sitting in front of Yong Cheon Myeong spoke up.

“Such scraps of paper won’t be enough to invite the masters of the Ten Sects.”

He was Gu Mun-hoe, Yong Cheon Myeong’s strategist.

Yong Cheon Myeong’s gaze turned towards Gu Mun-hoe.

“That’s the problem. I can’t go and find them all by myself.”

The Ten Sects were scattered across various regions.

Even if Yong Cheon Myeong tried to find them all, it would take at least three to four months, no matter how fast he was.

Although everyone was optimistic about Yong Cheon Myeong becoming the next leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance without any issues, Yong Cheon Myeong thought otherwise.

Ja Hong Cheon, the leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance, was not someone who would easily hand over his power. He even saw his disciples as competitors and kept them in check.

When Yong Cheon Myeong returned from the mission in Celestial Demon Troupe as a disabled person, it was proof that Ja Hong Cheon was using him for his own purposes.

He never missed a small flaw in his opponent and utilized it thoroughly. Having experienced this for years, Yong Cheon Myeong’s hatred towards Ja Hong Cheon had reached its peak.

But regardless of his feelings, he had to carry out Ja Hong Cheon’s orders. Failing the mission would mean falling behind in the succession race.

His fellow student, Woon Dae Yon, seemed to be completely overshadowed by him for the time being, but he was still a threatening competitor. The fact that he still maintained a special relationship with Eun Il Myeong, the young master of the Myriad Merchant Troupe, was proof enough.

“If I leave my position, my junior brother will surely seize the opportunity.”

“If the young master cannot leave his position, then we must make them come to us on their own.”

“To catch a big fish, special bait is needed. It’s no different for the lords of the Ten Sects.”

“There’s always a way. The question is whether we have the ability to execute it.”

Yong Cheon Myeong’s eyes sharpened.

“If you release a monster fish into the pond, the scattered fish will gather together.”

“Monster fish… Are you talking about the Celestial Demon Troupe?”

Gu Mun-hoe’s eyes curved into crescents, indicating affirmation.

Interest appeared on Yong Cheon Myeong’s face.

“There are many things we can use. For instance, assassins…”

“If we’re not careful, the backlash could be significant.”

“As long as there’s no link back to us, won’t it be fine?”

“Hmm! It seems you have an alternative in mind.”

“That’s why I’m suggesting it. Even if they fail, it won’t hurt you, young master”.

Finally, a smile appeared on Yong Cheon Myeong’s lips.

Seeing this, Gu Mun-hoe also smiled.

Someone knocked on the door to Yong Cheon Myeong’s room.

As Yong Cheon Myeong permitted, a martial artist hurried in.

“I’m sorry, Young Master. There’s something urgent I need to report.”

“The martial artist you asked to be investigated is causing a disturbance outside.”

“The martial artist I ordered to be investigated?”

“Yes! It’s someone named Lee Gwak.”

Yong Cheon Myeong lifted his head to look outside the window.

The martial artists of the Discipline Squad were lying on the ground, groaning. Fortunately, none were dead, but the inability to move properly indicated they had sustained quite significant injuries.

This was the first time such a situation had occurred since Du Il-yeop became the leader of the Discipline Squad.

The Discipline Squad had never been so disastrously defeated before, nor had its authority been so thoroughly challenged.

This was why it was both shocking and infuriating.

Du Il Yeop drew his sword as quick as lightning.

He had discarded any underestimation he had for his opponent. The opponent was an incredibly strong martial artist, the likes of which he had never faced before.

To confront such an individual, Du Il Yeop too had to exert his full strength.

Du Il Yeop’s sword cut through the air with a terrifying force.

The silver blade aimed for Lee Gwak’s neck in the shortest distance possible.

With a metallic sound, Du Il Yeop’s sword was deflected. Lee Gwak had parried Du Il Yeop’s sword with his Leaf Hand Blade.

However, Du Il Yeop was not dismayed.

Having watched Lee Gwak fight his subordinates, he had already gauged Lee Gwak’s martial prowess to some extent.

Such an attack would not be a threat to Lee Gwak. Knowing this, Du Il Yeop still chose a straightforward attack approach.

It wasn’t necessary to unleash a powerful strike or a terrifying technique to take someone’s life.

As the straightforward strikes accumulated, they eventually became as heavy as the sky or as massive as a mountain.

This was Du Il Yeop’s special sword technique, the Heavenly Mountain Sword Technique.

What started as simple and light became unbearably heavy with each strike, accumulating weight.

With each strike beginning lightly but accumulating into an unbearable weight, the clash resounded!

With the sound of metal, Lee Gwak was pushed back.

The hand that wielded his Leaf Hand Blade was now red and burning hot. The weight of thousands of pounds seemed to be transmitted through the edge of his blade.

Du Il Yeop’s attacks were getting faster. Accordingly, the weight and destructive power carried by his sword increased exponentially.

The attack had already surpassed the limit of what could be blocked with Lee Gwak’s Leaf Hand Blade. No matter how exceptional Lee Gwak’s hand blade was, it couldn’t escape the limits of physical endurance.

The judgment was quick, and the action was swift.

Lee Gwak’s blade flashed out like lightning.

The sound of the blade being drawn made Du Il Yeop’s neck hairs stand on end.

Instinct warned him of the imminent danger.

Trusting his animal-like instincts, Du Il Yeop hurled his body backward.

At that moment, the tie holding Du Il Yeop’s hair was cut, and his hair became disheveled.

Du Il Yeop’s face contorted in an ugly manner.

Had his reaction been even slightly slower, it wouldn’t have been the tie but his neck that was severed.

Cold sweat ran down his spine, and his palms, gripping the sword, were drenched in sweat.

But his crisis was far from over.

It was a simple thrust, but it was fast.

Faster and more powerful than any strike Du Il Yeop had made with his Heavenly Mountain Sword Technique. Du Il Yeop couldn’t even dare to dodge and raised his sword to block.

Swords collided, sending a fierce metallic sound echoing through the area.

Silver fragments flashed in the air.

Broken pieces of the sword blade reflected light as they flew through the air.

Du Il Yeop bit his lip hard enough to draw blood.

The sword in his hand was broken in half, and Lee Gwak’s sword was at his neck.

Having one’s weapon broken in half was an indelible disgrace for a martial artist.

As he inserted the broken sword back into its sheath, he opened his mouth.

“I have lost. But my defeat doesn’t mean your victory. By injuring a martial artist of the Jade Heaven Alliance within the territory of the Jade Heaven Alliance, you’ve essentially made the Jade Heaven Alliance your enemy. Can you handle that?”

“Previously, I didn’t see it that way, but now I see you’re quite talkative, Leader Du.”

“I was once part of the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

If a martial artist of this caliber had been in the Jade Heaven Alliance, it would be impossible for him not to know. The Jade Heaven Alliance would not have overlooked someone with Lee Gwak’s martial prowess.

Instinctively, Du Il Yeop realized there was some circumstance he was unaware of.

“That’s what they call me in the Jianghu.”

Du Il Yeop inadvertently let out a sigh.

He had only recently received reports about a martial artist with the nickname Sura Blade.

Until then, he hadn’t paid much attention.

Defeating Woo Mun Pae or Moon Gwang was impressive, but it was irrelevant to the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Du Il Yeop’s role was strictly to enforce the Jade Heaven Alliance’s rules and laws. Thus, he hadn’t paid much attention to external figures. However, if the opponent was a martial artist from the Jade Heaven Alliance, the story changed.

Although the shock of defeat was significant, if the opponent was the martial artist who had defeated Woo Mun Pae and Moon Gwang, it wasn’t as shameful.

“Is it true that you were a martial artist of the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

“I was part of the Outer Hall. I was the leader of the 13th squad.”

“The leader over there can verify my identity.”

Upon Lee Gwak’s pointing, Maeng Hee Cheon’s expression twisted miserably.

Du Il Yeop asked Maeng Hee Cheon.

“Do you think I’m not serious? Answer truthfully.”

“It’s true that he was part of the Outer Hall. But that was a very long time ago.”

A deep furrow formed between Du Il Yeop’s eyebrows.

Lee Gwak possessed something beyond merely being strong, something only those who had directly crossed hands with him could feel.

‘Just this can’t be his real strength.’

If he was only somewhat strong, Du Il Yeop would have used the Alliance’s influence to capture Lee Gwak and cover up the entire incident. However, Lee Gwak’s strength was beyond what he could dare to judge.

Such a strong figure could not be treated like any other martial artist, even by Jade Heaven Alliance’s standards.

Perhaps Lee Gwak had revealed his strength with this in mind.

“Can you tell me what happened?”

“There are too many eyes here right now.”

“Let’s go inside Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“For now, that’s the formality. But I assure you, no harm will come to you.”

“Absolutely. Despite being humiliated by you, I’m not shameless enough to speak double. I hold to my word.”

Du Il Yeop raised his voice to his subordinates sprawled on the ground.

“How long do you plan to lie there? Can’t you get up?”

The martial artists of the Discipline Squad, clutching their wounded chests, struggled to their feet.

Fortunately, because Lee Gwak had restrained his power, none suffered fatal injuries.

Lee Gwak left the guesthouse with the Discipline Squad.

Left behind, Maeng Hee Cheon slammed his fist down on the floor.

With Du Il Yeop taking Lee Gwak away, the truth of what happened here would come to light.

No matter that Lee Gwak had been one of his subordinates, initiating an attack was unforgivable. Even if forgiven, the stigma of defeat couldn’t be erased.

Becoming the Outer Court head now seemed impossible.

He glared at Lee Gwak’s retreating figure with bulging eyes.

Lee Gwak sensed Maeng Hee Cheon’s hostile gaze but was not afraid.

If he had feared Maeng Hee Cheon, he wouldn’t have dared return to Jade Heaven Alliance, let alone challenge the Discipline Squad.

Surrounded by the Discipline Squad’s martial artists, Lee Gwak passed through the outer court gate of the Jade Heaven Alliance. The Outer Hall martial artists guarding the gate didn’t dare question Lee Gwak’s identity, overawed by the Discipline Squad’s presence.

The Discipline Squad, responsible for enforcing Jade Heaven Alliance’s laws, was feared for a reason.

Someone among the Outer Hall martial artists tilted their head, recognizing Lee Gwak’s face.

“Lee Gwak? The one who was the leader of the 13th squad…”

A few remembered Lee Gwak’s face.

While some newer members didn’t recognize him, those who had been in the Outer Hall for a while all knew Lee Gwak.

“My God! It really is squad Leader Lee.”

“How could this be? What’s happening?”

The Outer Hall martial artists who belatedly recognized Lee Gwak were disturbed.

To them, it appeared Lee Gwak was being taken by the Discipline Squad for committing a grave offense.

Circumstances prevented Lee Gwak from properly greeting them.

Reconnecting with them wasn’t the priority at the moment.

Greetings could wait; Lee Gwak focused solely on following the Discipline Squad.

Passing through the Outer Court gate to the Inner Court gate was swift.

As they were crossing the Inner Court gate, they were stopped.

A heavy voice, laden with internal energy, reached the ears of Lee Gwak and the Discipline Squad.

The moment he heard the voice, a glint appeared in Lee Gwak’s eyes.

Lee Gwak slowly turned to face the source of the voice.

There stood Yong Cheon Myeong, with a storm brewing in his eyes.

“So, you were really alive. Lee Gwak!”
