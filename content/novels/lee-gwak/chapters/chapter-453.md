Whoosh!

A strong gust of wind swept across the training ground.

In that instant, the eyes of the man standing at the edge of the training ground flashed. He wasn’t particularly tall, but he held a sword in his hand.

The violent wind surged toward him like a storm.

Then, as if by illusion, the swordsman vanished.

Sasasak!

A faint, almost imperceptible sound of movement echoed through the air. Immediately, the large man standing on the opposite side of the training grounds shifted his gaze to the left.

“So, you’re over there.”

The giant man swung his fist to the left.

In an instant, a powerful gust of wind shot out from his fist. It was the speed with which he swung his fist that generated the wind.

It was a technique that defied common sense.

The left wall shattered under the fist wind, debris and dust scattering in all directions.

Amid the swirling dust, the swordsman appeared as a flickering shadow. The dust revealed his presence.

But the swordsman showed no sign of surprise. He had never believed he could deceive the giant man in the first place.

Shiing!

His sword sliced through the air, aiming for the giant man.

Despite the gleaming, razor-sharp blade flying at him, the giant man didn’t retreat or dodge. Instead, he punched toward the incoming sword with a fist larger than a pot lid.

Boom!

An overwhelming force erupted from his fist, another fist wind generated purely by speed.

The fist wind, moving at a speed imperceptible to ordinary people, targeted the swordsman. But by the time it arrived, the swordsman had already vanished.

Moving at a speed barely discernible to the naked eye, the swordsman closed in on the giant man. Yet, the giant man somehow detected his movements and countered.

Seeing such a massive figure move with unbelievable agility was astonishing.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two fought for a long time after that, but neither managed to land a decisive blow or inflict any meaningful injury.

A group of onlookers watched their battle with bated breath.

“Whoa!”

“I didn’t know you could move like that!”

“That’s insane!”

“How is that kind of movement even possible?”

The onlookers were four children: Lee Cheong, Lee Soo-ah, Pi Jin-ui, and Jo So-hye. And the two men clashing were Cheol Gwang-woo and Cheon Wol.

Though they refrained from using sword or fist qi, their prowess was already among the best in the Jianghu.

Watching their duel, the children were deeply inspired.

Whenever they had time, the children sparred as well. Sometimes Lee Cheong faced Pi Jin-ui, other times Lee Cheong clashed with Lee Soo-ah. Jo So-hye also joined in whenever she could.

And it wasn’t just the children.

The atmosphere in the Mad Martial Sect was as fiery as a volcano.

Most disciples lived each day with intense dedication.

The martial arts Lee Gwak had created for the disciples fell into three main categories:

One Pillar Heart Art.

Eight Paths Thunder Step.

Eight Paths Blade and Sword Technique.

Even those new to martial arts could learn them easily and quickly.

Thanks to this, the disciples of the Mad Martial Sect were improving at a remarkable pace.

Had it stopped at those three techniques, perhaps the disciples wouldn’t have remained so enthusiastic.

But even during the chaotic war between the Celestial Demon Troupe and Jade Heaven Alliance, Lee Gwak secluded himself to develop new martial arts for the disciples.

He welcomed anyone, regardless of when they joined the sect.

Those who mastered the initial three techniques were granted access to learn his newly created ones.

For any martial artist, the ultimate dream is to become stronger.

In other sects, no matter how talented someone was, their training could be limited by birth, status, or other constraints.

As a result, many with great potential hit invisible walls and were never able to reach their full capabilities.

But the Mad Martial Sect was different.

With enough talent and passion, anyone could reach higher realms.

Given this environment, many threw themselves into martial training with fanatical devotion, resulting in a surge of disciples mastering the three foundational arts.

Lee Gwak then taught them his newly devised techniques.

Among those who learned the new arts, some stood out, many of whom had already mastered their own martial arts before joining.

They were individuals who had already established their foundations as martial artists. Yet, they faced unexpected rivals.

The orphans taken in from the Heavenly Fate Sect.

Before being picked up by Lee Gwak, these children had never even heard of martial arts. But being young, they immersed themselves in this new world with terrifying speed, absorbing Lee Gwak’s teachings at an astonishing pace.

Unburdened by preconceptions, they accepted his guidance without doubt, achieving unbelievable progress.

Lee Gwak singled out the most exceptional among them, placing them under the leadership of Pi Jin-ui and Jo So-hye.

These children were the future of the Mad Martial Sect.

When they matured and became the core, the sect would finally stand tall as a renowned faction in the martial world.

Because of this, Lee Gwak devoted himself wholeheartedly to their training.

Thus, the martial artists of the Mad Martial Sect spurred each other on, growing rapidly.

As a result, they built a formidable force that could hold its own against any other faction in the martial world.

They were still far behind the Jade Heaven Alliance or the Seven Sects, but the foundation for greatness had been laid.

From a corner of the training grounds, Lee Gwak watched Cheol Gwang-woo and Cheon Wol spar.

His long hair hung freely, and a thick beard now covered his face.

His eyes had grown deeper, and he exuded a calm confidence.

Years in seclusion had matured him.

‘They’ve both reached extraordinary heights.’

A faint smile formed on his lips.

Both men had endured bitter hardships.

Now, the results of their struggles were clear.

They could stand against any master in the Jianghu. If they officially emerged into the world, the rankings of top warriors would certainly be shaken.

Their skills were just that extraordinary.

As Lee Gwak watched them with pride, someone entered the training ground.

It was Lim Sobo.

She walked straight up to Lee Gwak.

From her expression, he sensed something was off.

“What is it?”

“A guest from Jade Heaven Alliance has arrived.”

“Changcheonmaeng?”

“Yes. The Outer Hall Chief has come in person. He brings a personal letter from the Lord of the Alliance. What shall we do?”

“A personal letter from Ja Hong-cheon?”

“They must be desperate. They’re isolated and under siege, so they’re reaching out for help wherever they can.”

“Bring him to the Main Hall.”

“I’ll escort him with proper courtesy.”

“Good.”

The two quietly left the training grounds so as not to disturb the duel.

Lee Gwak headed to the main hall, while Lim So-bo separated off to greet the guest.

“Greetings, Sect Master!”

“The Sect Master has arrived!”

Disciples greeted Lee Gwak along the way.

Their eyes reflected genuine reverence.

It wasn’t just because he was the sect master, they truly respected him from the heart.

Lee Gwak had founded the Mad Martial Sect from scratch, raising it to new heights in a short time. This wouldn’t have been possible without Lim Sobo’s brilliant support, but Lee Gwak had been the one to find her and entrust her fully.

Lee Gwak rarely involved himself in day-to-day affairs.

He lived like a ghost, almost invisible. But his presence was never forgotten.

He was the pillar that held up the sky for Gwangmumun.

Every disciple knew that without him, there would be no Mad Martial Sect.

So their greetings came from genuine respect, not obligation.

“Long time no see. Is your training going well?”

“Your progress is impressive. You’ve worked hard, haven’t you?”

Lee Gwak didn’t pass them by lightly. He spoke kind words to each one.

The disciples would blush like boys in love.

Leaving them behind, Lee Gwak entered the main hall.

He rarely came here, spending most of his time with his family in the rear gardens.

Though he didn’t reside here, the servants kept the hall immaculate.

Having been absent for so long, the hall felt strangely unfamiliar.

After glancing around briefly, Lee Gwak took his seat on the sect master’s throne.

The oversized throne, meant to project authority, felt uncomfortable. Despite having sat here for years, it still felt like wearing ill-fitting clothes.

Just then—

“Sect Master! I’ve brought Geum Gu-ho, the Outer Hall Master of the Jade Heaven Alliance!”

Lim So-bo’s voice echoed from outside.

Lee Gwak straightened his posture.

“Bring him in.”

“Yes!”

The door opened, and Lim Sobo entered with Geum Gu-ho.

Geum Gu-ho clasped his hands and bowed.

“I am Geum Gu-ho, the leader of the Outer Hall of Jade Heaven Alliance. I greet Master Lee Gwak of Mad Martial Sect.”

“It’s been a while, Chief Geum!”

“Have we met before?”

“I once watched you from afar, back when I was just a lowly martial artist in Jade Heaven Alliance. I didn’t even dare approach you.”

“That’s unfortunate. Perhaps things would be different now if we had met then…”

Geum Gu-ho sounded sincerely regretful.

Had he known, he could have recruited Lee Gwak when it mattered. But spilled water cannot be recovered.

The more he looked at Lee Gwak, the more he felt it was a loss.

There was no trace of his former affiliation with the Jade Heaven Alliance.

His demeanor was calm and composed. Though he lacked the imposing aura of a sect leader, Geum Gu-ho wasn’t fooled by appearances.

No matter how he looked at it, this was the man who had once fought the Jade Heaven Alliance’s leader, Ja Hong-cheon, to a standstill.

Considering how Ja Hong-cheon had suffered for nearly a year from his injuries, Lee Gwak’s martial prowess was beyond comprehension.

“I’ve brought a personal letter from our Alliance Leader. Please read it and give us your answer as soon as possible.”

Geum Gu-ho retrieved the sealed letter and presented it respectfully.

Without hesitation, Lee Gwak opened and read it.

His expression didn’t change as he read.

Geum Gu-ho, however, watched anxiously.

When Lee Gwak finished reading, he finally spoke.

“So you are asking an alliance. Join hands to drive out the Celestial Demon Troupe, and

in return, the Jade Heaven Alliance will hand over half of its business rights to us.”

Lim So-bo’s eyes widened slightly at this.

Despite years of war, the Jade Heaven Alliance had endured because of its vast business holdings.

A century of investments had given them control of lucrative assets, such as salt flats and mines, sources of wealth that had allowed them to endure even the worst of times.

These were their last line of defense. Offering half was proof of their desperation.

Geum Gu-ho then said, “Now that you’ve read it, please consider carefully and give us your answer. I hope it will be a favorable one.”

“No need to wait. I’ll answer now.”

“What?”

Geum Gu-ho looked stunned. He hadn’t expected Lee Gwak to reply so quickly.

“My answer is no.”

“Sect Master Lee!”

“I have no reason to join hands with the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“Please reconsider! Though past grievances remain, we cannot dwell on resentment forever! With the Celestial Demon Troupe as our common enemy, keeping our distance will only bring greater disaster!”

“I understand. But my answer remains unchanged.”

“Sect Master Lee!”

“Once, I served under you, Hall Master Geum. I even received wages from the Jade Heaven Alliance. Do you think I wouldn’t want to help? But as long as Alliance Leader Ja Hong-cheon remains in power, the Mad Martial Sect will never ally with the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“And if our alliance falls, do you truly believe you can withstand the aftermath?”

Geum Gu-ho’s eyes sharpened like blades.

His gaze demanded an answer.

And Lee Gwak gave one.

“No, I don’t. But that doesn’t mean I’ll make the mistake of joining forces with the Jade Heaven Alliance. I don’t presume to solve everything myself. I simply do my best at every moment and leave the rest to heaven’s will.”

“You’re making a grave error.”

“The gravest error would be allying with the Jade Heaven Alliance just to survive this crisis. No matter how difficult, the Mad Martial Sect will seek its own path, and find its own breakthrough.”
