The name of the thread was Blood Silver Thread..

Han So-cheon had obtained it by chance during her time as an assassin. It was so thin that it was almost indistinguishable to the naked eye, yet it was terrifyingly sharp beyond words.

When traps were set with the Blood Silver Thread, anyone caught by it would almost certainly have their ankles severed and fall. Initially, Han So-cheon relied on Blood Silver Thread, but later sealed it away due to its terrifying power.

She did not want to display such a killing technique in front of her child. If it weren’t for this situation, Han So-cheon would never have used the Blood Silver Thread.

Tap, tap, tap!

Han So-cheon weaved through the battlefield, attacking Je Mu-hyeok with the Blood Silver Thread.

Since the Blood Silver Thread was spread like a spiderweb, Je Mu-hyeok could not move carelessly and focused solely on defense.

Little by little, his body accumulated wounds.

However, Han So-cheon’s expression was not bright; the wounds Je Mu-hyeok suffered were merely scratches on the surface of his skin, not one was a fatal strike.

The most serious injury was on his ankle from the Blood Silver Thread, so it could be said that her attacks were almost ineffective.

Je Mu-hyeok’s martial prowess was terrifying.

A direct confrontation was impossible.

During her time as an assassin, Han So-cheon successfully carried out many almost impossible assassinations. However, these were only possible because of her thorough preparations beforehand.

Sometimes, it took days, sometimes months to prepare and execute a plan, boasting a high success rate.

If she had been given that amount of time and leeway, she was confident she could assassinate even Je Mu-hyeok. However, her current situation was far too harsh.

She had to fight a formidable foe using only her limited weapons and her own martial skills. The only consolation was that the battlefield she had chosen still gave her some advantage.

In the dense bushes the Blood Silver Thread spread like a spiderweb.

This environment limited Je Mu-hyeok’s movements and multiplied her power.

“Kuh!”

Je Mu-hyeok’s face contorted.

He hadn’t anticipated that Han So-cheon would set such a trap to restrict his movements.

Han So-cheon’s attacks were not much, but the Blood Silver Thread spread across the ground was the issue. One wrong move and his ankle would be severed.

Because of that, Je Mu-hyeok gave up any rash movements and kept a close defense while keeping his eyes on Han So-cheon.

On the Blood Silver Thread, Han So-cheon’s movement was as swift as a swallow.

‘Bitch!’

Je Mu-hyeok’s eyes blazed with a fierce killing intent.

He raised his fist to the sky.

Tatatata!

Han So-cheon rushed towards him on the Blood Silver Thread.

A distinct aura of light formed around Je Mu-hyeok’s fist.

It was Fist Qi.

Je Mu-hyeok was about to unleash his Fist Qi at Han So-cheon when.

Whisk!

In an instant, a barely visible silver thread wrapped around his wrist. Han So-cheon had sent the Blood Silver Thread flying like the wind.

If he continued with his Fist Qi, he could severely injure Han So-cheon, but his wrist would also be sliced off.

“Kuh!”

Thud!

Ultimately, instead of unleashing his Fist Qi, Je Mu-hyeok radiated kinetic energy from his wrist.

The Blood Silver Thread was thus flung away before it could tighten.

“Such a petty trick…”

Je Mu-hyeok furiously pursued Han So-cheon. But during the brief moment his attention wavered, she had vanished without a trace.

“What?”

At that moment, Je Mu-hyeok felt a stealthy killing intent from beneath.

Looking down, he saw Han So-cheon close to his lower half, looking up at him.

Shwihaek!

From below, Han So-cheon slashed upwards with her dagger.

“Ha!”

In a moment of crisis, Je Mu-hyeok unleashed his Rebound Qi. Because of that, Han So-cheon’s blade bounced off before it could even reach Je Mu-hyeok’s body.

The impact was so intense that her wrist nearly snapped off. However, Han So-cheon endured the pain and swung her dagger repeatedly.

Swi-shik!

Her blade persistently struck the Rebound Qi. If Rebound Qi were so easily broken, it would not have been called such.

Je Mu-hyeok’s body, swirling with Rebound Qi, inflicted wounds on Han So-cheon instead.

It was obviously an attack like trying to crack a rock with an egg. Han So-cheon knew that fact as well. Even so, she did not give up.

Just as everything in the world has a flow, there was a flow in martial arts too.

Rebound Qi was a formidable technique, but it could not be maintained indefinitely because human energy has its limits.

Indeed, Je Mu-hyeok could only use his rebound qi for a short time and could not maintain it for long. The flow was about to break.

‘Bitch!’

Je Mu-hyeok’s eyes flared with killing intent.

He hadn’t expected to be pushed to this extent by a mere bitch. He was angry at himself for being pushed back like this, even though he had the upper hand in terms of strength.

“I’ll kill you!”

Je Mu-hyeok’s rage exploded.

He withdrew the weakened rebound Qi and switched to an offensive stance.

At that moment, Han So-cheon’s eyes sparkled.

This was the moment she had been waiting for.

For this moment, she had spread the rebound Qi and battered Je Mu-hyeok like a storm, a preliminary work to completely unnerve him.

“Ha!”

With a scream, Han So-cheon grabbed a piece of the Blood Silver Thread near Je Mu-hyeok.

Even though she used her internal energy to protect her hand, the Blood Silver Thread still dug into her flesh.

She felt intense pain, but Han So-cheon did not scream; instead, she tightened her grip and pulled. In response, the Blood Silver Thread spread out like a spider’s web all around and came fluttering along.

What Han So-cheon had grabbed was the core of Blood Silver Thread. Pulling here would drag the entire web.

Hwiririk!

The Blood Silver Thread wrapped around Je Mu-hyeok.

Before Je Mu-hyeok could react, the Blood Silver Thread enveloped him.

Han So-cheon then pulled the Blood Silver Thread tightly.

If it continued like this, Je Mu-hyeok’s body would be sliced into dozens of pieces by the Blood Silver Thread. And that was the final chapter of the scene Han So-cheon had envisioned.

Just as her plot was about to conclude, Je Mu-hyeok suddenly struck the ground with a punch.

“Cha-hat!”

Boom!

A deep pit was formed with a loud explosion.

Je Mu-hyeok quickly hid in the pit he had created, causing the net of Blood Silver Thread to sweep through the air in vain.

Caught off guard, Han So-cheon’s complexion turned pale.

The Blood Silver Thread, having lost its target, helplessly fell to the ground, and her spirit wavered.

“Bitch!”

At that moment, Je Mu-hyeok burst out of the pit.

His face, covered in dirt, looked ferociously sinister.

Bang!

His blow, charged with rage, exploded against Han So-cheon.

Han So-cheon curled her body tightly to absorb the impact as much as possible. However, Je Mu-hyeok’s attack was not something that could be mitigated so simply.

Crash!

Han So-cheon’s body was thrown roughly to the ground.

“Kuh!”

Her lips parted. Crimson blood soaked her lips and chest.

It was a severe internal injury from just one blow. Yet, Je Mu-hyeok’s attack was far from over.

Bang! Bang!

His fists pounded on Han So-cheon relentlessly.

Barely regaining her senses, Han So-cheon tried to dart away, but Je Mu-hyeok would not allow it.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

His large hand grabbed Han So-cheon’s ankle and slammed her down.

Boom!

“Kuh!”

Han So-cheon vomited blood again.

Her consciousness began to fade.

‘Is this the end?’

A look of grievance crossed Han So-cheon’s face.

She did not feel wronged about losing her own life; she had committed many sins. However, the thought of her daughter, Lee Soo-ah, also losing her life was too cruel.

“It’s over.”

Je Mu-hyeok raised his fist high.

A powerful aura of light gathered around his fist, forming a distinct shape.

It was Fist Qi.

If he struck down now, Han So-cheon’s frail body would shatter into pieces.

“Stop!”

Swoosh!

At that moment, a sharp cracking sound rang out along with a girl’s cry. Lee Soo-ah, who was hiding, couldn’t take it anymore and threw her sword. A small pouch of oil was attached to its handle.

“Hmph! You think I’d fall for the same trick again?”

Je Mu-hyeok swung his fist to the side, deflecting the flying blade effortlessly.

Lee Soo-ah’s plan to douse Je Mu-hyeok in oil and set him on fire went up in smoke.

Chwah-haak!

Je Mu-hyeok spread his palm toward Lee Soo-ah, and a tremendous wave of attracting Qi surged, pulled her towards him.

It was the technique of Void Capture.

“Eek!”

Lee Soo-ah clenched her teeth and resisted, but it was futile. Her small body was helplessly dragged toward Je Mu-hyeok.

Crack!

Je Mu-hyeok’s large hand clasped around Lee Soo-ah’s throat.

Lee Soo-ah’s face turned deathly pale.

“Soo-ah!”

Seeing this, Han So-cheon tried to rise, reaching out her hand.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

Bang!

But Je Mu-hyeok brutally stomped on her chest.

Han So-cheon was slammed back to the ground, vomiting blood once more.

“Oh, mom!”

Lee Soo-ah looked down at her mother, tears streaming down her face.

Chirp, chirp!

Off to the side, the red-eyed rat seemed to laugh at the mother and daughter.

Je Mu-hyeok, holding Lee Soo-ah by the neck and stepping on Han So-cheon’s chest, said,

“At least you’ll go to the afterlife together, hand in hand.”

He increased the pressure in his hand and foot.

Gradually, the color drained from both mother and daughter’s faces.

‘Ah, father!’

Lee Soo-ah’s eyes rolled back, exposing the whites.

“Soo…ah!”

Han So-cheon flailed her hands, seeing her daughter. She herself was on the verge of suffocation, but she was more concerned for Lee Soo-ah than herself.

‘Hurry…’

She thought of her husband as she watched Lee Soo-ah struggling to breathe.

“Soo-ah, So-cheon!”

Just then, as if answering her prayers, a man’s voice carried on the wind.

Han So-cheon blinked dully, wondering if she was hearing things.

Then it happened.

Roar!

A ominous sonic boom filled the air.

Je Mu-hyeok’s eyes widened in shock.

“What?”

In that instant, something long and sharp flew like lightning and struck his chest.

Bang!

“Kuk!”

Je Mu-hyeok failed to react and was flung backward, finally freeing Han So-cheon and Lee Soo-ah.

“Soo-ah!”

Han So-cheon quickly embraced her daughter, checking if she was alive.

“Huh! Oh, mom!”

Fortunately, Lee Soo-ah gasped for breath.

Han So-cheon held Lee Soo-ah and looked toward Je Mu-hyeok.

Je Mu-hyeok was getting up. He had managed to gather his energy just before the object hit, protecting his vitals, otherwise his ribcage would have been completely shattered.

Je Mu-hyeok looked toward the long object that had struck his chest.

It was a blade.

An unsheathed blade lay scattered on the ground.

Je Mu-hyeok eyed the direction from which the blade had come. There, he saw a man rushing toward them at a terrifying speed.

Though the distance was too great to make out the features of his face, Je Mu-hyeok instinctively knew the identity of his opponent.

“Lee…Gwak!”

The only man who would rush to save Han So-cheon and Lee Soo-ah was him.

The moment he saw Lee Gwak, every hair on his body stood on end from the intense sensation.

Even as his wife and daughter lay battered, Lee Gwak showed no change in expression.

Lee Gwak’s appearance was chillingly terrifying.

At that moment, he reached out his hand in their direction.

Rumble!

Suddenly, the blade at Je Mu-hyeok’s feet shook as if an earthquake had occurred.

‘What?’

A look of suspicion flashed across Je Mu-hyeok’s face just as the blade was swiftly drawn from its sheath and flew in his direction.

Lee Gwak had used Void Capture to retrieve the thrown blade.

Click!

The blade flew over a great distance and landed in his hand.

The moment the blade was in Lee Gwak’s hand, the air in the area turned sharply cold.

Hiss!

His blade now aimed at Je Mu-hyeok.
