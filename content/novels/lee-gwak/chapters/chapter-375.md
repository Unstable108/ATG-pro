Someone’s Death Becomes Fertilizer for Another (4)

Lee Gwak gazed at the river, its waves churning violently.

Suddenly, rain began to pour, and the current grew fierce.

The once calm river had turned into a raging torrent, and the peaceful boat was now in chaos.

As the boat rocked violently in the turbulent waters, the cargo on board shifted back and forth.

“Tie it down securely. Make sure it’s firmly fastened.”

“If we lose even one, the reputation of Jeon Gong Escort Agency will be ruined. Everyone, protect the cargo.”

Oh Jung-gyeong and Soo Gu-san directed the escorts to secure the cargo. Their bodies were soaked to the bone from the rain and the water splashing up from the river. Yet, not a single one of them complained, doing their utmost to protect the cargo.

Their dedication gave Lee Gwak a strange sense of admiration.

It was then.

Srrrk!

A tightly tied rope came loose and a large piece of cargo slid across the deck. Unfortunately, a guard from the Jeon Gong Escort Agency was standing in its path.

“Watch out!”

“Get out of the way!”

The other escorts shouted belatedly, realizing the danger, but it was too late for him to move.

“Ugh!”

The escort clenched his eyes shut, bracing for the immense pain and impact, but surprisingly, he felt nothing.

Cautiously, he opened his eyes and saw a man standing in front of him, blocking the sliding cargo.

It was Lee Gwak, who had been standing at the bow.

He had leapt forward to shield the escort from the cargo.

“Ah!”

The escort let out a gasp.

Still holding the cargo, Lee Gwak looked at the escort and asked,

“What should I do with this cargo?”

“Ah! Please push it this way. I’ll tie it to the railing over here.”

“Got it.”

Lee Gwak followed the escort’s instructions and moved the cargo.

A look of admiration appeared on the escort’s face.

Lee Gwak was a renowned figure in the martial world, yet here he was, following the instructions of someone as insignificant as himself. It was deeply moving.

He was impressed by Lee Gwak’s humility.

With Lee Gwak’s help, the situation on the deck stabilized.

Soon after, the rain stopped, and the waves gradually calmed. Only then could everyone catch their breath.

“Huff! Huff!”

“We made it.”

The escorts looked at each other and sighed in relief.

Though they were all drenched, they could still smile, knowing they had successfully protected the cargo.

Oh Jung-gyeong walked over to Lee Gwak.

Wiping the sweat and water from his face, he spoke to Lee Gwak.

“Thank you! We owe you our lives.”

“Don’t mention it.”

They spoke more casually than before

Two days had passed since they boarded the boat with Cheon Wol. During that time, they had genuinely bonded.

They were similar in age and shared similar views on life and philosophy. Their mutual respect had turned them into friends.

Oh Jung-gyeong asked, “How is Cheon Wol doing?”

“He’s improving.”

“That’s a relief.”

Lee Gwak’s answer made Oh Jung-gyeong nod.

Indeed, Cheon Wol’s condition had noticeably improved.

The effects of the Ginseng Doll, Seok Yi-cheon’s care, Cheon Wol’s own efforts, and Bang Ye-in’s cooking had all contributed to his rapid recovery.

Though walking was still difficult, he might be able to manage by the time they disembarked.

While this was clearly good news, Lee Gwak’s expression remained gloomy.

He knew why Cheon Wol was so desperate to recover.

“Seeing Lee Gwak’s dark expression, Oh Jung-gyeong patted his shoulder and said, ‘Cheer up. Whatever decision he makes, it’s his choice, isn’t it? There are things you can help with and things you can’t. You can’t control someone else’s heart.'”

“I know. But I can’t help worrying.”

“I never thought the Sura Blade would be such a sentimental person.”

“I’m human too.”

“You’re a good person. But you don’t have to be a good person to everyone. You’ve already done your best to save him. That’s enough. You don’t need to take responsibility for what happens after.”

Lee Gwak smiled faintly at Oh Jung-gyeong’s words.

Though they had only known each other for a few days, Oh Jung-gyeong spoke to him like an old friend. His advice resonated because it came from a place of sincerity.

“Thank you! I feel much better now.”

“If you ever need help, just let me know. This old man is always ready to give you advice. Hehe!”

“Haha!”

Lee Gwak laughed heartily at Oh Jung-gyeong’s joke.

It was the first time he had laughed so freely in a long time.

The two continued to chat as the boat sailed on.

Their conversation continued until the boat reached its destination.

Thud!

The boat docked at the pier with a heavy sound.

After the other passengers disembarked, the Jeon Gong Escort Agency also unloaded their cargo and carriages.

Lee Gwak’s group got off last.

“Should I help you?”

“I can walk on my own.”

When Seok Yi-cheon offered his arm, Cheon Wol refused.

His legs wobbled like bamboo in the wind, but he stubbornly refused any support and tried to walk on his own.

Determination filled Cheon Wol’s eyes.

He nearly collapsed several times along the way, but he ultimately managed to get off the boat by himself.

He moved his legs slowly and painfully, nearly falling several times, but he managed to walk off the ship by himself.

By the time he reached the pier, he was drenched in sweat as if he had taken a bath.

Bang Yein shook her head in disgust at the sight of Cheon Wol.

Lee Gwak said nothing to Cheon Wol.

Right now, words of sympathy or comfort were useless to Cheon Wol. He had to overcome this by his own will.

As Lee Gwak stood by, Ojungkyeong approached.

“Your destination is Yuk-an, right?”

“That’s right.”

“Then we can travel together for part of the way. We have an extra carriage, so you can ride in it.”

“Is that alright?”

“Of course. Getting to ride for free while under your protection is a win for me.”

“I’ll have to think about it.”

“It’s too late for that. Get in. We’re leaving soon.”

Oh Jung-gyeong grinned and returned to the escorts while Lee Gwak relayed the offer to his group.

“That’s great.”

Seok Yi-cheon was the most delighted.

Riding in a carriage would be much better for Cheon Wol’s recovery.

Cheon Wol didn’t object to riding in the carriage either.

After struggling to disembark on his own, he realized he still needed to focus on his recovery.

The carriage wasn’t large enough for all five of them. Cheon Wol, Bang Ye-in, and Seok Yi-cheon rode in the carriage, while Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang-woo chose to walk with the escorts.

There was no horse large enough to carry Cheol Gwang-woo’s massive frame, and for Lee Gwak, walking or riding made little difference.

The escort guards kept stealing glances at Lee Gwak.

They still couldn’t believe they were traveling alongside such a legendary figure.

“Our lord and the Sura Blade are friends. How’s that possible?”

‘I will dedicate my life to the Jeon Gong Escort Agency.’

It was clear that with an absolute master like Lee Gwak backing them up, the Jeon Gong Escort Agency would grow much larger than it was now.

The escorts of the Jeon Gong Escort Agency couldn’t help but feel proud.

To them, Lee Gwak was like an idol.

Walking with an idol, no road was too rugged or tiring. As a result, the speed of transporting their charges significantly increased.

A gust of wind swept in from somewhere, gently lifting Lee Gwak’s hair. He walked through the currents of the wind.

‘Brother!’

Cheol Gwang-woo suddenly stopped and watched Yi Gwak’s retreating figure.

It almost looked as though the wind itself was parting the way for him.

“What is the meaning of this, Sister?”

Yu Mun-sang furrowed his brow.

His gaze was fixed on Sa Yeon-hee, before whom Woo Mun-pae was kneeling on the ground?

Sa Yeon-hee had subdued Woo Mun-pae and barged straight into Yu Mun-sang’s quarters.

Woo Mun-pae couldn’t even move his mouth because his pressure points were controlled, and he was desperately looking to his master for help.

His look suggested something had happened.

Killing intent appeared in Yu Mun Sang’s eyes.

“Useless fool!”

“There’s no need to insult him.”

“Sister!”

“He is only guilty of following your orders, brother.”

“I don’t understand what Sister is talking about.”

Yu Mun Sang initially denied it. However, Sa Yeon-hee was not convinced.

The two looked at each other as if they were ready to devour each other.

“Sigh!”

Suddenly, Yu Mun Sang sighed.

He realized that there was no point in hiding any longer.

“Can’t we just let this go, Sister?”

“You know we can’t.”

“Are you saying we should see this through to the end? You know it won’t help the sect one bit.”

“If we leave it like this, the entire sect will collapse.”

“Sister!”

Yu Mun Sang’s gaze darkened.

Everyone knew. When Yu Mun Sang was truly angry, his eyes looked like this.

Yu Mun Sang stood up from his seat.

“To reject the path of mercy and choose punishment instead. You’ve always been so inflexible, Sister.”

“The Sword Sect exists for that reason. Think again and take the longer way if necessary. That’s why the first sect Master established the Sword Sect, to prevent possible mistakes and wrong decisions.”

“You speak such outdated words.”

“Are you denying the authority of the first sect Master?”

Hmph! What’s so great about the first Sect Master? I, Yu Mun Sang, revitalized the Martial Sword Troupe and established it as one of the Ten Sects. Before my leadership, the Martial Sword Troupe was just another sect.

His voice rang loudly through the great hall.

He no longer hid his true feelings.

Sa Yeon-hee looked at Yu Mun Sang with pity.

“Brother!”

Yu Mun Sang was an extraordinary man.

If not for him, it would have been impossible to revitalize the Martial Sword Troupe to this extent.

However, as distinct as his achievements were, his mistakes were equally non-negligible.

To restore the Martial Sword Troupe, Yu Mun-sang had secretly operated the Nine Shadows Fleet, plundering passing ships and drowning countless innocents.

Sa Yeon-hee spoke.

“Brother, step down as sect leader.If you do, I will make sure that your legacy remains untarnished and I will handle this quietly.”

“Do you think I became the leader just to step down at your word? No one can force me out of this position. I am the one who rebuilt the Martial Sword Troupe – it belongs to me!”

The killing intent in Yu Mun-sang’s eyes deepened.

RUMBLE!

A terrifying surge of qi erupted from his body, shaking the grand hall as if an earthquake had struck.

Sa Yeon-hee bit her lip.

The man before her was the greatest martial artist in the Southern Jianghu in the past century. The sheer force of his aura was enough to make one’s flesh tremble.

She had no desire to clash with Yu Mun-sang.

If possible, she would have avoided it. But she knew better than anyone that it was no longer an option.

SHING!

Sa Yeon-hee drew her sword.

All hesitation was gone from her face.

This was a battle for the fate of the Martial Sword Troupe.

If she could not defeat Yu Mun-sang, the sect would inevitably fall. To prevent this, she drew her blade without a moment’s hesitation.

Yu Mun-sang advanced towards her.

A deep blue qi, reminiscent of the ocean, swirled around his body.

It was the Blue Dragon Sea Art, the martial art that had made Yu Mun-sang the undisputed ruler of the Southern Jianghu.

BOOM!

Yu Mun-sang and Sa Yeon-hee clashed.

This was a battle that would decide the fate of Mugeomryeon and the Southern Sea.

They poured everything into their fight, unleashing every technique they had mastered.

CRACKLE—BOOM!

Like the wrath of heaven itself, thunderous roars shook the earth for an entire day and night.

All the warriors of Mugeomryeon rushed outside to witness the spectacle.

Everyone expected Yu Mun-sang to win.

His martial prowess was overwhelming, befitting his title as the ruler of the Southern Murim.

But Sa Yeon-hee was his natural counter.

At some point, her sword began to cut through Yu Mun-sang’s techniques.

A look of shock crossed Yu Mun-sang’s face.

He, too, realized that her martial arts were countering his own. But his realization came too late.

Once the tide of battle had turned, there was no reclaiming the momentum.

THUD!

Sa Yeon-hee’s Sea King Sword pierced Yu Mun-sang’s chest.

His body trembled violently as he glared at her.

“To think… someone like you… would be the one to bring me down.”

His body collapsed.

That day, a legend of the Southern Jianghu fell, and a new absolute master rose in his place.
