Cloud Steps was the most renowned movement technique of the Wudang Sect.

It could be used either as a qigong skill or a footwork technique, so every disciple of the Wudang Sect learned it. However, few had mastered Cloud Steps to its deepest level.

Wudang had many supreme movement techniques, such as the Flowing Body Technique, the Mysterious Heaven Steps, and the Four Symbols Step. When paired with appropriate martial arts, these could unleash tremendous power.

Those who trained in the sword primarily learned the Flowing Body Technique, while those who practiced fist techniques mostly studied the Four Symbols Step.

Because of such compatibility between martial arts and footwork, many disciples treated Cloud Steps merely as a fundamental concept and didn’t delve deeper into it.

The only one to have reached the highest level of Cloud Steps was Jinghae himself—

but even he had never imagined it was possible to reach this level.

The Wudang disciples stood dumbfounded in the grand martial arts arena of the Wudang Sect, staring at the old man slowly descending from the sky.

He was dressed like a farmer.

His hair was entirely white, and his face was deeply wrinkled, making it impossible to guess his age.

The first to recognize the old man was Master Cheongsong, the head of the Wudang Sect.

“Cheong… Cheonghwa Sasuk?”

“It’s been a long time, my junior.”

“H-how… how are you here?”

Cheongsong Jin was so shocked that he stumbled over his words.

Cheonghwa was his senior Taoist brother, whom he had exiled to the Swallow Tail Peak due to their irreconcilable differences. Guilt had kept him from visiting for over a decade, and now, Cheonghwa’s face seemed almost unfamiliar.

Cheonghwa smiled warmly at Cheongsong Jin.

“The situation looked dire, so I left my exile without your permission.”

“Senior…?”

“I’ll take whatever punishment comes later. That’s not what matters right now.”

Their eyes met.

At that moment, Cheongsong Jin flinched. The profound aura in Cheonghwa’s eyes startled him.

Even a decade ago, Cheonghwa’s eyes had been filled with this same aura. Unlike his own eyes, clouded with worldly desires, Cheonghwa’s gaze had always made him feel small.

Perhaps that’s why he had used his authority as sect leader to exile Cheonghwa to Swallow Tail Peak and had never visited.

Over the past ten years, the depth of Cheonghwa’s aura had only intensified. His mystical gaze seemed to penetrate all worldly affairs.

Unable to withstand it, Cheongsong turned his head away. So did the other elders.

They had all supported Cheongsong’s decision to exile Cheonghwa in the name of Wudang’s prosperity. None of them could now meet his eyes.

“Master!”

“Elder!”

Only a few disciples, recognizing Cheonghwa, called out with joy.

Cheonghwa gave them a soft smile and walked toward Jinghae.

Jinghae spoke weakly.

“Ma… Master!”

“You look good.”

“I…”

“It’s good to see you finally showing some humanity.”

At first, Jinghae thought he was being mocked and stiffened. Soon, however, a range of emotions crossed his face.

Cheonghwa smiled.

“Too strong, and you break. Too rigid, and you’re bound to break. You should have experienced this sooner. Was the defeat painful?”

“I brought shame to Wudang.”

“Did Wudang ever have honor to begin with?”

“That is…”

“The founding patriarch never cared for honor. He only wished that Wudang could play a small role in saving the world. Honor was never a concern. Let me ask again. Were you ashamed that Wudang shut its gates for the past hundred years?”

“N-No, I wasn’t.”

“Then why chase after honor? If it wasn’t shameful, why obsess over it?”

“I…”

Jinghae couldn’t answer.

Cheonghwa clicked his tongue.

“Tsk! Jinghae, you foolish child. Your masters and elders have filled your head with nonsense. Was Lee Gwak, who defeated you, always strong? He became who he is today through countless defeats. Let me ask him something.”

Cheonghwa turned to look at Lee Gwak, who nodded slightly.

“When you were defeated, were you ashamed?”

“No.”

“Then?”

“I just tried to survive. I didn’t have the luxury to feel ashamed.”

“So, in trying to live, you reached where you are now?”

“Yes.”

Thud.

Jinghae felt like he’d been struck with a hammer. He had assumed Lee Gwak valued honor as much as he did. But no.

Lee Gwak had never cared for honor, not until recently, when he founded Mad Martial Sect and realized its importance. Until then, he had considered it meaningless.

That mindset has made Lee Gwak who he is today.

At that moment, Cheonghwa looked to the sky and murmured.

“Chasing too much ruins you. True strength is knowing when to let go.”

It was a quote from Laozi’s Tao Te Ching.

It’s better to let go than to chase endlessly and fill.

Cheonghwa’s calm words struck like thunder in the ears of the Wudang elders.

“Ugh!”

“Ahh…”

Some were moved to tears, unable to bear their shame.

Jinghae was no different.

He wept openly, unable to withstand the overwhelming guilt.

Martial artists, who considered crying a disgrace, watched the scene without criticism or scorn.

Cheonghwa’s words had shaken them to their core.

He asked Jinghae again:

“Do you still feel ashamed of your defeat?”

“N-no.”

“Is the Wudang Sect’s honor still important?”

“No.”

“Then what is?”

“What matters is rising after defeat.”

“Now you’re finally worth something.”

Pleased with the answer, Cheonghwa smiled gently.

He extended his hand, and Jinghae took it, struggling to his feet.

Still holding Jinghae’s hand, Cheonghwa looked at Cheongsong Jin.

“Cheongsong! I will take Jinghae and teach him myself.”

“Sa… Sasuk!”

“Let go of your greed. Why must you force things for the sake of the Wudang name? What does it matter how others see us? Their opinions don’t change the essence of Wudang. And stop trying to change the Jianghu—it’s a great river. Can a small stone like Wudang alter its flow? Wait patiently; one day, it will return—but not now.”

“Ugh!”

Cheongsong Jin clutched his chest at Cheonghwa’s piercing words. They stabbed like daggers.

Cheonghwa looked back at the elders behind Cheongsong. They hung their heads, unable to meet his gaze.

Finally, Cheonghwa turned to Lee Gwak.

He smiled faintly.

“Thank you. You must have been furious, yet you ended things here.”

“Not at all.”

“Not showing oneself is what brings clarity. Not asserting oneself is what brings recognition. You are far greater than these fools. Hahaha!”

His laughter echoed across Mount Wudang.

For a moment, the clouds trembled, and a fierce wind seemed to sweep through.

The martial artists stared in awe at the unbelievable sight.

Still holding Jinghae’s hand, Cheonghwa activated the Cloud Steps.

As if strolling on clouds, the two figures vanished into the sky.

“To think Wudang had such a master…”

“Truly, reputation does not lie.”

The crowd murmured in astonishment at Cheonghwa’s display.

Jinghae’s defeat was overshadowed by Cheonghwa’s presence.

Cheongsong Jin and the elders had feared the Wudang Sect’s honor would be shattered by Jinghae’s loss. But Cheonghwa’s display ensured that at least some dignity remained.

“Cheonghwa, was it? If Jinghae trains under him, he’ll grow even stronger.”

“The Wudang Sect’s foundation is indeed formidable. To have such a master hidden away in plain sight…”

“I look forward to Jinghae’s return.”

Excitement filled the crowd’s faces.

The memory of Jinghae’s defeat was already fading.

Lee Gwak frowned slightly.

“So this is what they mean when they say old ginger is spicier.”

He felt like he’d been blindsided by Cheonghwa.

Though he had won the fight, Cheonghwa’s appearance had overshadowed his victory.

By losing the battle, the Wudang Sect had preserved and even enhanced its mystique.

Cheonghwa had taken so much with just one appearance. But Lee Gwak wasn’t upset.

He had achieved his goal.

People turned their attention back to Lee Gwak.

Without his victory, Cheonghwa would never have appeared.

The martial artists shuddered, reminded once again of just how formidable Lee Gwak was.

Lee Gwak stepped away from the ruined stage.

Cheongsong Jin and the elders still stared blankly at where Cheonghwa had vanished.

“Sigh… How shameful.”

Cheongsong Jin exhaled deeply.

He had exiled Cheonghwa because of their differences, but he had not resented him. Instead, he trained diligently and achieved heights beyond imagination.

With such power, he could have easily taken control of the sect, but chose instead to guide Jinghae.

His message was clear: he would train Jinghae to become Wudang’s pillar.

For the Wudang Sect, this was a tremendous blessing.

As Lee Gwak approached, Cheongsong Jin finally snapped out of his daze.

Lee Gwak clasped his fists respectfully.

“I sincerely congratulate the Wudang Sect on its reopening.”

“……”

“With the duel concluded, I shall take my leave.”

“You’re… leaving already?”

“Yes.”

“Grandmaster Lee, about this incident…”

“It was a good match. Please convey my regards to Taoist Jinghae—I hope to meet him again. Then…”

Lee Gwak bowed slightly and turned to leave.

Cheongsong Jin watched his retreating figure and muttered:

“We lost… utterly lost. Hah…”

His laughter was hollow.

The faces of the Wudang elders and disciples flushed red.

They had no words.

The elders, in particular, closed their eyes, their expressions bitter. But they weren’t entirely without hope.

Cheonghwa had shown them a path forward.

He had given them faith in a better tomorrow.

One day, when Jinghae returned, he would wash away today’s disgrace.

The true rise of the Wudang Sect would come then.

Cheongsong Jin clasped his fists toward the crowd and declared the ceremony concluded.

“With this, the Wudang Sect’s reopening ceremony has ended. We thank all the masters for staying until the end. Wudang will use today’s lessons as fertilizer for greater growth. Our gates will remain open—please visit anytime.”

Reopening the mountain gate had been a struggle.

Even with Jinghae’s unexpected defeat, they could not afford to shut it again.

Though they would restrain their activities for now, their gates would stay open.

As Cheongsong finished, the crowd began to disperse.

“Damn it all!”

Namgung Hoe, who led the Thousand Kingdom School here, stormed off with a twisted expression.

He was one of those who expected Lee Gwak to lose to Jinghae. However, contrary to his expectations, Lee Gwak had not only won but emerged even more formidable.

Now, cheap tricks would no longer work on Lee Gwak.

Every martial artist present now saw him not just as another powerful martial artist, but as a titan of the era—a figure who could shape the age itself.

With this, Lee Gwak’s standing had risen to new heights.

Namgung Hoe bitterly regretted squandering his chance to build a strong relationship with Lee Gwak in the past.

Even as the delegations from the Seven Sects began to leave Wudang one by one, there was one person who remained until the very end.

It was Joo Shin Yoon, from the Jade Heaven Alliance.

With cold, sharp eyes, he stared at Lee Gwak without moving an inch.

“Lee Gwak!”

He now understood without a doubt.

Lee Gwak was no longer just a future threat—he was already a dagger pressed against the Jade Heaven Alliance’s throat.

If left unchecked, he would shake the very foundations of the alliance.

Joo Shin Yoon’s lips moved slightly, sending a sound transmission to someone.
