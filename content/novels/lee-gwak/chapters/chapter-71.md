Manhwa: Chapter 63

“That was a pointless thing to do.”

“I apologize.”

Lee Gwak responded calmly to Maeng Hee-cheon’s reprimand. That made Maeng Hee-cheon frown. It wasn’t the reaction he had expected.

Maeng Hee-cheon stared at Lee Gwak. Since he was seated while Lee Gwak stood, he had to tilt his head up to meet his gaze.

At that moment, Maeng Hee-cheon’s expression turned irritable. He didn’t like the positioning, having to look up at Lee Gwak, and having Lee Gwak look down at him.

Lee Gwak’s gaze was clearly calm and composed. There was not the slightest trace of defiance in them, and yet Maeng Hee-cheon found it strangely unnerving.

‘Am I imagining it?’

There was no way that a mere squad leader could challenge his authority. Especially not Lee Gwak, who was the squad leader of Squad 13, the lowest-ranked among the thirteen squads.

There was only so much that a squad leader with a half-formed unit could do. That was why Maeng Hee-cheon had deliberately excluded Squad 13 from important missions, relegating them to external patrol duty.

Maeng Hee-cheon slammed his hand on the desk.

“Release them.”

“From now on, unless they cause serious trouble, don’t interfere and just ignore them.”

“Understood.”

Lee Gwak answered without hesitation, not offering any argument or objection.

After offering a respectful bow, Lee Gwak exited the hall.

Once outside, Lee Gwak lifted his gaze to the sky.

‘So in the end, the line leads all the way to the Hall Leader.’

He had suspected as much. But now that it had been confirmed, he couldn’t deny that it left a bitter taste. Even so, Lee Gwak made sure not to show a trace of disappointment.

If there was one lesson he had learned while living in this place, it was that revealing emotions carelessly was dangerous.

The Jade Heaven Alliance was the center of Jianghu, and naturally, it drew countless people, and with them, countless intentions.

Some approached with genuine goodwill, but far more did not. To bare one’s true thoughts openly in a place like this was nothing short of foolishness.

Lee Gwak let out a sigh and started walking toward the dungeons.

Inside, the men he had captured a few days ago were still imprisoned.

“Heh! See? I told you they’d have to release us eventually. You should’ve listened to me from the start.”

“Looks like we’re finally getting out.”

A victorious smirk appeared on the faces of Yi Woo-myeong and Jang Wi-moon, the leaders of the group.

During their time in the dungeon, they leveraged every connection they had, ultimately securing a line to Maeng Hee-cheon, the leader of the Outer Hall.

For them, the Outer Hall Leader was the highest-ranking person they could possibly reach, and now that they had his backing, there was no reason to concern themselves with a mere squad leader like Lee Gwak anymore.

“Look at him—what a joke.”

“Fuck! If you’d just walked past us when I told you the first time, we wouldn’t have to go through all this trouble.”

The men leaned against the iron bars, sneering at Lee Gwak as he passed.

Lee Gwak wordlessly walked past them and stood in front of the cell holding Yi Woo-myeong and Jang Wi-moon.

They had originally been locked up together with the rest of their gang, but at some point, the guards had moved them to separate solitary cells.

Yi Woo-myeong looked at Lee Gwak with a mocking expression on his face, while Jang Wi-moon observed him with a more cautious gaze.

Lee Gwak unlocked the cell door that Yi Woo-myeong was locked in and spoke in a low voice.

“Yi Woo-myeong, born in Yongshan County, Yunnan Province. Studied at the Sacred Martial Dao Temple nearby. Married the daughter of the temple master, and together, they had one son and one daughter.”

“W-what? How the hell do you know that?”

Yi Woo-myeong’s eyes widened in shock.

“Your wife is dead, and your two children are currently staying in Pingjiang County, fifty li away from here.”

“You bastard! How the hell do you know that?!”

As soon as Lee Gwak unlatched the lock, Yi Woo-myeong kicked open the cell door and stormed out.

Thinking about the safety of his two children, he had never brought them to the slums but left them in the hands of someone he trusted in Pingjiang County.

It was a secret that no one knew. Not even the subordinates he had gathered since coming here knew about it. And yet, Lee Gwak had spoken of it effortlessly, as if it were common knowledge.

Fortunately, his voice was low enough that even Jang Wi-moon, who was locked in the next cell, couldn’t hear him, but for Yi Woo-myeong, it was more than enough to send him into a panic.

He had already lost his hometown and his wife. The only thing that mattered to him now was his children.

Losing his composure, he lunged at Lee Gwak.

In an instant, Lee Gwak drove the butt of his sword into Yi Woo-myeong’s abdomen.

The pain that tore through his entire body was so intense that Yi Woo-myeong couldn’t even scream. He collapsed, kneeling on the ground, his breath hitching in ragged gasps.

“You bastard! What the hell did you say to my brother?”

“I’m going to kill you!”

Yi Woo-myeong’s subordinates shouted in anger, but Lee Gwak’s expression remained completely unmoved.

Without sparing Yi Woo-myeong another glance, Lee Gwak turned toward Jang Wi-moon and unlocked his cell.

“Jang Wi-moon, originally from Renhuai County. Trained for seven years at Lee Family Martial Hall. Had an affair with Yun Hwa-sook, the wife of his master, and fathered a daughter. When the affair was on the verge of being exposed, he poisoned his master to death…”

As Lee Gwak continued speaking, Jang Wi-moon trembled violently.

The words coming out of Lee Gwak’s mouth were his deepest, darkest secret. Something that should never be revealed to the world.

Lee Gwak opened the cell door, but Jang Wi-moon didn’t move. He just stood there, shaking, unable to charge at Lee Gwak. This was because he had seen how Yi Woo-myeong had been rendered helpless with a single blow.

He knew that there was no point in trying to fight back.

‘How in the world… does a martial artist from the Outer Hall possess such skill…?’

He was someone who had trained in martial arts for years. Sure, he had succumbed to lust, had an affair with his master’s wife, and even poisoned his own master but at the very least, he had always believed in his own martial skills.

No matter how renowned the Jade Heaven Alliance was, he had been certain that the low-ranking Outer Hall martial artists were nothing he couldn’t handle. Yet that confidence had been shattered by Cheon-wol, the youngest of Squad 13. And against Lee Gwak, he didn’t even have the nerve to make a move.

There was no visible aura around Lee Gwak, no martial glow or fierce killing intent. By all appearances, he was just a calm and unassuming man. And yet, something about him made it impossible to act.

His mind told him to fight, but his body refused to move. It was as if the bridge connecting them had been severed.

‘There are times when a dragon is found wallowing in the mud… but isn’t this too much?’

Jang Wi-moon bit his lip so hard that blood trickled down his chin.

But no matter how fiercely he glared, Lee Gwak remained completely unfazed. Without another word, Lee Gwak moved past him and unlocked the remaining cells.

A dull metallic sound echoed through the dungeon as the cell doors swung open. However, none of the men who had mocked Lee Gwak a moment ago charged in.

They just stood there with their mouths open and their bodies trembling, as if they had seen a ghost.

Jang Wi-moon could easily guess why. Just like himself and Yi Woo-myeong, Lee Gwak must have revealed their deepest secrets—the things that should never be known—right in front of them.

A chill crawled up his spine.

They had only been imprisoned in the dungeons for two or three days. That was far too short a time for anyone to conduct a thorough background investigation.

Moreover, they weren’t just a handful of men, there were dozens of them. For one person alone to have uncovered everything about all of them within such a short time, it was simply impossible.

At least, for a single person, it was.

To Jang Wi-moon’s understanding, such a feat could only mean one thing—

‘He has someone backing him.’

A fresh wave of chills ran through his body.

Lee Gwak wasn’t just threatening one or two men.

He was pressuring all of them.

Telling them that he knew everything.

That if he so willed it, he could destroy everything they held dear. That they had no choice but to behave themselves.

‘What kind of…?’

When he had secured a connection with Maeng Hee-cheon, the leader of the Outer Hall he thought he could ignore Lee Gwak’s warnings and live as he pleased. But now, at this moment, he understood with certainty.

That they could never go against Lee Gwak.

Jang Wi-moon clenched his fist tightly.

He wanted to kill Lee Gwak here and now if he could, but Lee Gwak didn’t seem to have a single opening to exploit. Lee Gwak stood like a towering wall, an impenetrable force.

More than anything, Jang Wi-moon feared the power supporting Lee Gwak.

With this level of intelligence gathering, it wasn’t just a matter of having Outer Hall’s backing. Someone far more powerful had to be looking after him.

At last, after unlocking every door, Lee Gwak spoke.

He didn’t offer any threats or warnings. But none of the men dared to defy him. Not a single man spoke a word of protest.

One by one, the men slumped their shoulders and walked out in silence. When all had left, only Jang Wi-moon remained.

Just before stepping outside, he turned back and looked at Lee Gwak.

“…This may sound like an excuse, but my master was a wretched scum. He violated his female disciples and kept my wife under his control through threats. If I hadn’t killed him, many more would have had to endure hellish suffering.”

“Hah, not that saying this makes any difference… As per Squad Leader Lee’s warning, I won’t lay a hand on ordinary people. Then… I’ll be on my way.”

Jang Wi-moon gave a deep bow to Lee Gwak before walking out.

Lee Gwak watched his retreating figure without a word.

He knew exactly how Jang Wi-moon and the others saw him. That was precisely what he had intended.

It was Nam Woo-gyeong’s gift. Before leaving the Jade Heaven Alliance, he had left Lee Gwak a ledger containing the personal records of those who had entered the slums.

It was the Hao clan’s policy not to pass on important information, but he figured this much was acceptable.

Stepping out of the dungeon, Lee Gwak suddenly looked up at the sky.

The sky was piercingly blue, with the sun beating down harshly. As Lee Gwak squinted against the blinding light—

“Squad Leader Lee!”

A familiar voice called out to him.

Turning his head, he saw a member from another squad running toward him.

“What is it?”

“You have been summoned to the inner city.”

“The inner city? Do you know who’s calling me?”

“No, sir! The orders came from above, but they said that once you arrive, someone will be there to escort you.”

Lee Gwak furrowed his brows slightly at the person’s answer. But his answer had already been decided.

“Understood. I’ll head there immediately.”

“Yes, sir! Then, I’ll take my leave…”

The young squad member gave him a quick bow before turning back the way he came.

Now alone, Lee Gwak began making his way toward the inner city gates.

When Ma Duwon was still at the Creation Pavilion, he had frequented the inner city constantly. But ever since Ma Duwon had retired from Jianghu, he had stopped coming altogether. Perhaps that was why the road felt strangely unfamiliar today.

Upon reaching the inner city gates, Lee Gwak identified himself to the guards and waited. Soon, a man came hurrying out.

He was a scribe with a strict, rigid demeanor. Someone Lee Gwak had never seen before.

The man, who appeared to be in his mid-to-late twenties, swept his sharp gaze over Lee Gwak’s entire body, assessing him.

“Are you Lee Gwak, Squad Leader of Outer Hall’s Squad 13?”

“Follow me.”

Without offering any further explanation, the man simply turned and began walking away.

A bitter smile tugged at the corners of Lee Gwak’s mouth. The man’s attitude made it clear what he thought of him. Still, it didn’t particularly bother him. It was something he had long grown used to.

The place the man had taken him to was an area Lee Gwak had never visited before.

After passing through several layers of heavy security, including trap mechanisms and formation barriers, they finally arrived at a secluded, walled-off area.

“From this point on, be extremely careful with your movements. Do not make any gestures that could be misinterpreted. One wrong step, and you might find yourself in serious trouble. You are the first Outer Hall squad leader ever allowed into the Secret Court. Do not speak a word of what you see or hear here to anyone.”

Lee Gwak nodded silently at the scribe’s warning. The scribe, however, still looked at him with clear disapproval.

‘So it really is the Secret Court.’

Neither the Inner Court nor the Main Court were places Lee Gwak could enter freely, but the Secret Court was on an entirely different level.

As the nerve center of the Jade Heaven Alliance, where policies and strategies were crafted, only an extremely limited number of outsiders were ever granted access. Naturally, it was unthinkable for a martial artist from the Outer Hall like Lee Gwak to be allowed inside.

So it was no surprise that the scribe viewed him with disdain.

Without another word, the scribe led him toward a large pavilion within the Secret Court. At the deepest part of the pavilion, they arrived at a door. The scribe hesitated for a moment before carefully speaking.

“I have brought Squad Leader Lee Gwak from the Outer Hall.”

“Let him in.”

Without a sound, the door swung open. Inside, a spacious room came into view.

As Lee Gwak stepped inside cautiously, a familiar face greeted him warmly.

“Big brother!”

It was Lim Sobo.

But she wasn’t alone.

Seated across from each other were a young scholar, appearing to be in his mid-thirties, and a young martial artist who looked to be around the same age.

The scholar, with a faint smile on his lips, spoke first.

“Welcome, Squad Leader Lee. I am Yeo Jung-wol, the master of the Secret Court.”

The young ruler of the Secret Court was welcoming Lee Gwak in person.
