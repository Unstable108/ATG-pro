Early in the morning, Lee Gwak left the Paradise Inn. With him was not only Cheol Gwang Woo, but also Bang Yae-in, as they had planned to go to Xichang together.

Cheol Gwang Woo, glancing around cautiously, hesitantly spoke to Bang Ye-in.

Cheol Gwang Woo gingerly pointed to the large bag Bang Ye-in was carrying on her back.

Indeed, Bang Yae-in was carrying a burden almost as large as her torso.

The load contained a large wok needed for cooking, various spices, and a chef’s knife, making it quite heavy.

Surprised by Cheol Gwang Woo’s unexpected offer, Bang Yae-in briefly wore a blank expression before smiling gratefully.

Cheol Gwang Woo, scratching his head, took Bang Ye-in’s load onto his back. The bag that seemed so large on Bang Ye-in now looked tiny against Cheol Gwang Woo’s massive frame.

Cheol Gwang Woo, seemingly overjoyed for some reason, led the way.

This was perhaps the first time Lee Gwak had seen Cheol Gwang Woo in such high spirits since they met.

“He’s got a straightforward personality, doesn’t he?”

Bang Ye-in, still smiling, watched Cheol Gwang Woo’s back.

It was surprising that a man of such a huge stature could retain such innocence.

Bang Ye-in then asked Lee Gwak, “How did you meet him?”

Lee Gwak then shared the story of how he met Cheol Gwang Woo, without omitting any details.

After hearing everything, Bang Ye-in couldn’t hide her astonishment.

“He truly is special, to be able to materialize his madness like that.”

“And to think he reads sutras to calm his mind. That’s really unexpected.”

“At that time, it was the only way. But it seems to have helped somewhat, which is fortunate.”

Bang Ye-in nodded in agreement.

She was amazed by the hidden stories behind Cheol Gwang Woo, who seemed so innocent. It made her see Cheol Gwang Woo in a new light.

“Certainly, someone as extraordinary as you wouldn’t have ordinary companions.”

“What do you mean? Where else can you find someone as ordinary as me?”

“Haha! You really don’t think that, do you? A truly ordinary person would never earn the terrifying nickname ‘Sura Blade.'”

“You just want to appear ordinary, unaffected by the world’s turmoil… But you know better than anyone how impossible that is. The Jianghu will never let you be; it’s too cruel.”

“You sound just like someone I know.”

“Oh! Really? I’m curious who that might be. They must be quite insightful.”

Bang Ye-in looked genuinely curious at Lee Gwak, but he remained silent, pressing his lips tightly together. Seeing this, Bang Yae-in didn’t press further.

Instead, she changed the subject.

“Spirit Granny has been seen near the Siege Fortress.”

“Yes! She suddenly appeared and caused quite a commotion near the Siege Fortress. Since you’re going to the Siege Fortress, be careful of her. As she’s gotten older, she’s become even more unpredictable. Many people have been ruined after crossing paths with her, so be extra careful.”

Lee Gwak’s brow furrowed deeply.

Although Bang Ye-in meant to express concern, it stirred up turmoil in Lee Gwak’s heart.

Spirit Granny had used her disciple, Yeom So So, to lower his master’s guard and then launched a surprise attack with the God’s Blood Tear

Although Lee Gwak had dealt the final blow to his master, it wouldn’t have been possible without the initial attack..

Gwang Noh ya, even in his last moments, didn’t wish for Lee Gwak’s vengeance. Instead, he was thankful for finally being able to rest in peace.

While Gwang Noh ya might have found peace, Lee Gwak, left alone in the world, did not.

Bang Ye-in watched his face with a puzzled expression, sensing instinctively that there was a story there.

Silence settled between them for a moment.

The awkward atmosphere was eventually broken by Cheol Gwang Woo, who was leading the way.

“Brother, there’s a nice place here to rest.”

His voice pulled the two out of their reverie.

When they looked up, they saw Cheol Gwang Woo waving at them from behind a large rock halfway up the mountain.

As they joined him, they were greeted by an unobstructed, refreshing view that lifted their spirits.

Bang Ye-in looked around and commented.

“It’s beautiful. How did you find such a scenic spot?”

“Hehe! Just stumbled upon it.”

“It would be really nice to eat here.”

A refreshing smile spread across Bang Ye-in’s lips.

She looked at Cheol Gwang Woo.

“Do you have any meat with you?”

“Just thought it’d be nice to have some meat… Well, it’s okay if we don’t.”

“Just wait a moment. I’ll bring some soon.”

Before Bang Ye-in could stop him, Cheol Gwang Woo dashed into the bushes. Watching his disappearing back, Bang Ye-in blinked in disbelief.

Suddenly, Bang Ye-in burst into melodious laughter.

Lee Gwak also shook his head with a smile.

Bang Yae-in stretched out, a bright smile on her face.

She then unpacked the luggage Cheol Gwang Woo had been carrying, revealing various cooking tools.

Turning to Lee Gwak, Bang Ye-in asked.

“Could you start a fire, please?”

Lee Gwak gathered dry branches nearby and, without a flint, ignited them with his samadhi flames.

As flames blazed, Cheol Gwang Woo re emerged from the bushes, a large deer slung over his shoulder.

Cheol Gwang Woo dropped the deer in front of Bang Ye-in with a thud.

“That’s more than enough. Can you handle the butchering as well?”

Cheol Gwang Woo began to butcher the deer without hesitation. He skinned it, deboned it, and cut off the most tender parts for cooking.

“Where did you learn to butcher like that?”

“No, I just learned by hunting a lot,”

A moment later, Cheol Gwang-woo handed a large piece of meat to Bang Ye-in.

“Perfectly. Thank you. Now, let me take care of the cooking,”

Bang Ye-in got to work. She trimmed the meat more carefully, cutting it into bite-sized pieces before putting it in a pot and stir-frying it. Once the meat was somewhat cooked, she added pre-prepared vegetables.

She sprinkled various spices into the pot and then poured in water, closing the lid.

The simmering pot, sending aromatic waves into the air, made Cheol Gwang Woo swallow hard even before the food was ready.

When Bang Ye-in finished, she presented a dish that looked utterly delicious, complemented by rice balls prepared beforehand from the inn.

“It’s not much, but it should be good. Dig in.”

Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang-woo simultaneously picked up their spoons and tasted the dish, exclaiming together.

The dish Bang Ye-in made was incredibly delicious, better than anything they’d ever tasted, even better than the best food they’d had at the Paradise Inn.

Cheol Gwang Woo was on the verge of tears, and Lee Gwak savored the taste with closed eyes.

‘This level of cooking is truly an art.’

Lee Gwak realized that Bang Ye-in’s dish wasn’t just about taste. There was something more profound.

The more he savored it, the more he felt a deep and unique aura.

Lee Gwak opened his eyes and looked at Bang Ye-in, who was smiling enigmatically.

“Incredible. To feel such a profound energy from food…”

“The founder of Bang Clan’s Inn, Bang Jin-bo, believed that food should not only taste good but also be beneficial to the body. That’s why all the recipes from Bang Clan’s Inn are healthy.”

There was great pride in Bang Ye-in’s voice.

Even a single sip had this effect. He couldn’t imagine the benefits of regularly eating her food.

Though the world is vast and full of wonders, a place that elevated cooking to this level existed only at the Bang Clan Inn. And the girl before him was its true successor.

Beside him, Cheol Gwang-woo, while eating diligently, kept stealing glances at Bang Ye-in.

His gaze was that of a boy experiencing his first crush. It was obvious what that look meant.

Cheol Gwang Woo gave a thumbs-up, his face drenched in sweat. Bang Ye-in smiled silently at him.

The meal ended quickly. Even after the dish was gone, Cheol Gwang-woo looked at the empty pot wistfully.

As Bang Ye-in gathered the empty dishes and pot, she said,

“It’s best to eat just enough. I’ll make more next time if we get the chance. For now, that’s it.”

Cheol Gwang Woo laughed awkwardly, scratching his head.

Bang Ye-in swiftly finished the cleaning and packed everything up. Her efficient handling left nothing for Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo to help with.

Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang-woo expressed their gratitude.

“Don’t mention it. Thanks to you, I ate well too. When traveling alone, it’s hard to eat properly.”

“But isn’t it dangerous to travel alone?”

“Sometimes it is, but I manage. I can handle a sword pretty well, though not as well as you two.”

Bang Ye-in shook her sword playfully, making Cheol Gwang Woo blush again.

Lee Gwak smiled briefly before standing up.

“Now that we’ve eaten and rested well, let’s move. If we don’t get out of this mountain by today, we’ll have to camp out.”

Cheol Gwang-woo and Bang Ye-in responded simultaneously. Cheol Gwang-woo carried Bang Ye-in’s luggage and led the way, while Bang Ye-in followed with her hands behind her back.

Lee Gwak followed at the rear, watching the two.

They traveled together for several days.

Throughout the journey with Bang Ye-in, Cheol Gwang Woo’s mood was soaring. He wished this time would never end.

But no journey lasts forever. When they reached Xichang as promised, their journey together ended.

Bang Ye-in was the first to say goodbye.

“I’ll be heading north from here. I don’t know when we’ll meet again, but take care.”

“Good luck finding the person you’re looking for.”

Bang Ye-in smiled and looked at Cheol Gwang-woo.

“I wish you luck on your journey too.”

“Thank you. If we meet again, can I have another meal?”

Cheol Gwang-woo beamed at her cheerful reply.

“Then I’ll definitely come find you again.”

“I’ll look forward to it. I’ll be going now.”

Bang Ye-in took her heavy luggage and walked away.

Cheol Gwang Woo stood still, watching her recede into the distance.

His fists were clenched, and his shoulders trembled.

Lee Gwak watched him silently.

Cheol Gwang Woo only turned to Lee Gwak after Bang Ye-in had completely disappeared.

“I will definitely meet her again. And then…”

Lee Gwak patted Cheol Gwang Woo’s shoulder a couple of times and nodded.

There were feelings and thoughts that didn’t need to be spoken to be understood. Lee Gwak already knew what Cheol Gwang Woo felt.

The big, burly boy had found a reason to grow up. His feelings for Bang Ye-in would help him grow even more.
