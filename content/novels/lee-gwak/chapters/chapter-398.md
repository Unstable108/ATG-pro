‘So this is the Mad Martial Sect?’

Jinghae looked around the interior of the Mad Martial Sect with an intrigued expression.

Lee Gwak, who had received the invitation, delayed giving a definite answer. Because of that, Jinghae had no choice but to remain at Mad Martial Sect to get his answer.

The Mad Martial Sect had all the characteristics of a newly founded sect.

Its structure was loose, and its martial artists seemed lost, unsure of what to do.

Of course, among them were a few with sharp eyes who knew exactly what they were doing, but such individuals were rare.

The overall atmosphere was still chaotic.

Jinghae didn’t dislike that.

Wudang had been like this a hundred years ago.

Not that Jinghae had witnessed it firsthand—he had only heard the stories.

But the descriptions had been so vivid that as a child, he had listened with clenched fists, completely absorbed.

It was the Wudang Sect’s reconstruction era.

They were short of disciples, and since the sect had closed its doors, they couldn’t get any help from outside.

Everything, from the smallest to the largest task, had to be done by the Wudang disciples themselves.

They had to replace fallen foundation stones, erect pillars, and rebuild roofs, all of which were unfamiliar to martial artists who had only trained in martial arts.

At first, everything was a mess. But over time, they grew used to the work.

Crude but sturdy halls rose within the Wudang Sect, all accomplished solely by the disciples’ efforts.

They worked during the day and trained at night. Through their struggles, the Wudang sect laid the foundation for its reconstruction, and the experience became a source of immense pride for its members.

Only after enduring this arduous era did the Wudang Sect gain the sturdy wings it needed to soar.

Of course, this was only possible because of the vast legacy left by their predecessors. Despite the hardships, the Wudang Sect’s vaults were filled with treasures and martial arts manuals.

That’s why they could now proudly claim a strength equal to that of a century past.

Naturally, the Wudang Sect and the Mad Martial Sect couldn’t be the same.

The difference in their foundations and the scale of their talent was too vast.

The reality was that without Lee Gwak, the Mad Martial Sect had no martial artists of note.

Even if given the same hundred years, it was impossible for the Mad Martial Sect to match the Wudang Sect.

Knowing this, Jinghae didn’t see the Mad Martial Sect as a threat.

Of course, Lee Gwak was an exception.

At the thought of Lee Gwak, Jinghae’s gaze darkened.

Though he had pretended to be humble in Lee Gwak’s presence, Jinghae was far from being a humble man.

He took immense pride in his martial prowess and believed it was only natural to be called the “First Sword of Wudand”

When the Wudang Sect first accepted him, even elder Cheongsong been stunned by his terrifying talent and martial aptitude.

If taught one thing, he could deduce ten, and from those ten, he could envision a hundred possibilities. His talent was truly fearsome.

Elder Cheongsong took him as a disciple and poured all his knowledge into him. And it wasn’t just him—all the Wudang elders rallied to teach Jinghae.

He absorbed their teachings like a sponge, growing at a terrifying pace.

All of the Wudang Sect’s secret manuals and elixirs were given to him. Jinghae mastered them all.

He was the culmination of the Wudang Sect.

He was the Wudang Sect, and the Wudang Sect was him.

As such, he had every right to be arrogant.

At least, that’s what Jinghae believed.

He merely hid his true feelings for the sake of his reputation.

Soon, Jinghae lost interest in the Mad Martial Sect.

The lively atmosphere was pleasant, but it wasn’t enough to satisfy his curiosity.

Now, the only person who held his attention was Lee Gwak.

Just then—

“You must be the guest from the Wudang sect.”

A woman’s voice suddenly reached his ears.

Turning his head, Jinghae saw a woman in her early twenties and a young martial artist who seemed to be her escort.

“Oh?”

For a moment, Jinghae’s face lit up with interest.

The woman’s eyes were sparkling like stars as she looked at him.

Eyes that shone with the brightness of all the world’s wisdom—he had never seen anything like them, not even at Wudang, where all the talents of the Jianghu gathered.

“And who might you be, young lady?”

“I am Lim So-Bo, the strategist of the Mad Martial Sect.”

“Ah, Lady Lim. I am Jinghae of the Wudang Sect. A pleasure.”

“We sincerely welcome your visit to the Mad Martial Sect, Grandmaster Jinghae.”

“Thank you. But did you say… strategist?”

“Yes! Though my abilities are lacking, I currently serve as the sect’s strategist.”

“Impressive. To hold such a position at your age… Ah, I don’t mean to belittle you for your youth. I’m simply astonished.”

“No offense taken.”

Lim So-Bo smiled faintly.

Her calm demeanor made Jinghae pause briefly.

Lim So-Bo was far too young to be a sect strategist.

Being a strategist wasn’t just about intelligence or knowledge. It required experience, insight, and the rationality and adaptability to apply that knowledge to reality.

Most strategists were older individuals. Even the most gifted talents usually didn’t qualify to manage a sect until their thirties.

Even Master Cheonghwa, the Wudang Sect’s strategist and a disciple of Master Cheongsong, didn’t begin actively participating in sect affairs until he was fifty.

For someone as young as Lim So-Bo to be a sect strategist was exceedingly rare.

‘Just who is this woman?’

Jinghae’s eyes sharpened.

If she was chosen by Lee Gwak, she couldn’t be ordinary.

‘Lim So-Bo… Lim So-Bo…’

As he repeated her name, Jinghae suddenly recalled where he had heard it before.

“Were you the strategist of the Thousand Kingdom School and Sky High Castle?”

“Correct! I moved to the Mad Martial Sect to help my oraboni.”

“Hmm!”

Jinghae let out an involuntary hum.

Before coming here, Master Cheongsong had told him something.

That the genius strategist of the Jade Heaven Alliance, Yeo Jung-Wol, had a disciple whose talent rivaled his own.

That disciple’s name was Lim So-Bo.

Jinghae blamed himself for not recognizing her sooner. At the same time, he felt a pang of regret.

His mentor, Master Cheongsong, had always praised Yeo Jung-Wol endlessly.

He often lamented that if he had his insight, he could have advanced the Wudang Sect even further. Regardless of age or status, Master Cheongsong revered Yeo Jung-Wol.

When news of Yeo Jung-Wol’s death spread through the Jianghu, no one mourned more than Master Cheongsong.

And now, Yeo Jung-Wol’s disciple stood before him.

Desire stirred in Jinghae.

If she truly possessed talent equal to Yeo Jung-Wol’s, she would be an immense asset to the Wudang Sect.

“If it’s not too presumptuous, I’d like to invite Lady Lim to our sect.”

“Huh?”

“My master deeply respected your master, Grandmaster Yeo. When the news of his death reached him, he grieved for three days and nights. He would be overjoyed to meet his disciple.”

“I appreciate the offer, but I have no plans to travel for the time being.”

“If you could spare the time…”

“Right now is the most critical period for establishing the Mad Martial Sect’s foundation. I don’t wish to leave for personal reasons.”

Lim So-Bo politely declined.

Jinghae considered pressing further but quickly reconsidered.

Someone like Lim So-Bo needed time to change her mind. Pushing too hard would only breed resistance.

Jinghae smoothly shifted the topic.

“Understood. By the way, where are you headed now?”

“To see the sect leader.”

“Perfect. I was hoping to meet Grandmaster Lee as well.”

“Then let’s go together.”

Lim Sobo nodded indifferently and began walking.

Jinghae moved close to her side.

At that moment, the man behind Lim So-Bo naturally stepped between them, subtly blocking Jinghae.

It was none other than Cheon Wol.

Jinghae’s eyebrow twitched at Cheon Wol’s seamless intervention.

‘Not bad.’

There wasn’t a single wasted motion in the way Cheon Wol inserted himself between Lim So-Bo and Jinghae. His movements were so natural that it was as if he had always been there.

At Jinghae’s level, a single glance was enough to gauge someon’e skill.

He immediately recognized that Cheon Wol’s martial arts were at a remarkably high level.

‘At this level, even our sect’s elite disciples wouldn’t dare claim victory.’

It seemed he needed to reassess the Mad Martial Sect.

With a strategist like Lim So-Bo and a martial artist like Cheon Wol, who knew how many other hidden talents they had?

‘Mad Martial Sect… Might be more formidable than expected.’

He now regarded them as a sect to watch out for.

With so much talent, it was only a matter of time before they would grow in size.

Though their actual combat strength was unknown, once a sect grew in size, its inner strength would soon follow. If that happened, even the Wudang Sect couldn’t afford to look down on them.

Jinghae’s thoughts grew complicated.

Cheon Wol glanced at Jinghae.

A glint of wariness flashed across his typically expressionless face.

Cheon Wol was wary of Jinghae.

Not for any particular reason—just an inexplicable unease.

Though young, Cheon Wol was a seasoned veteran who had experienced countless battles.

Having served as Lim So-Bo’s hidden blade, his intuition was sharper than most.

And his intuition was warning him that Jinghae was someone to be cautious of.

That’s why he had deliberately stepped between Lim So-Bo and Jinghae—to protect her.

Lim So-Bo noticed and gave him a subtle nod.

She had already been wary of Jinghae.

She had even guessed his intentions but chose not to show it.

‘For the Wudang Sect, these troubled times are the perfect opportunity.’

Over the past century, the Wudang Sect had faded from public memory.

Though they had recovered some strength during their seclusion, the problem was that their presence in the Jianghu had nearly vanished.

People saw the Wudang Sect as a forgotten legend, a relic of the past.

In such a situation, even if they reopened their gates and resumed activities, they wouldn’t attract much attention.

To reclaim their former glory, they needed to capture the public’s interest.

In a martial world where the Vast Sky Alliance and the Seven Factions vied for dominance, the only way to instantly regain relevance was to create a major event.

One such method was the Gathering of Sects.

By inviting the Jianghu experts and drawing all eyes to themselves, they could showcase their presence. And by unveiling an absolute master like Jinghae, they could flaunt the Wudang Sect’s enduring might.

If their plan succeeded, the Wudang Sect would instantly become the eye of the storm.

Lim So-Bo stole a glance at Jinghae.

In her eyes, she could see the sharp sword hidden behind his gentle exterior.

‘A man who carries a sword in his heart must also have great ambitions. He too is a predator of these troubled times.’

Had it been anyone else, she wouldn’t have needed to reveal herself. But because it was Jinghae, she had to see him in person and judge for herself.

That’s why she had appeared before him.

As they walked toward Lee Gwak’s quarters, they exchanged small talk. Even in their brief conversation, there was an undercurrent of probing and caution.

Even the short fifty-zhang walk drained her mentally.

By the time they reached Lee Gwak’s residence, Lim So-Bo was nearly exhausted.

The only reason she could still stand straight was because Cheon Wol was by her side.

“Hah!”

“Yah!”

When they arrived, Pi Jin-Yi and Jo So-Hye were practicing martial arts under Lee Gwak’s supervision.

The two children were training with all their might.

They were so focused that they didn’t even notice the guests.

Lee Gwak stood like a statue, silently watching over them.

Just as the children were too engrossed to notice, Lee Gwak was deep in thought, trying to figure out how to teach them more effectively.

He watched Pi Jin-Yi and Jo So-Hye’s every move, memorizing even the smallest details.

In his mind, a martial art suitable for them began to take shape.

“Jin-ui is serious by nature. That makes his movements deliberate. Light techniques wouldn’t suit him. Mountains? Yes, something as steady as mountains would suit him. So-hye is light, agile, exceptional flexibility. She needs a technique based on finesse rather than strength.”

Lee Gwak’s murmurs reached Jinghae’s ears.

Jinghae’s eyes widened as he stared at Lee Gwak.

He could sense Lee Gwak’s contemplation.

And that made it all the more shocking.

While Jinghae was still struggling to digest the Wudang teachings, the man before him was deliberating how to teach others.

The gap between them was unimaginably vast.

Only then did Jinghae see Lee Gwak as a towering figure.

“Is he a true master?”

Jinghae clenched his fists.
