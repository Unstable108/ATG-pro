Mount Wudang.

This was where the Wudang Sectonce a giant of the Jianghu kept its gates wide open.

The legend of the Sword Dispensing Pool, where no one entering Wudang was allowed to carry weapons, was still vivid in people’s minds.

Though it had been devoid of human presence for the past hundred years, people had recently started visiting Mount Wudang once again.

The news that Wudang Sect was reopening its gates after a century spread like wildfire throughout Jianghu.

Not only the officially invited guests, but also countless martial artists flocked to the Wudang Mountain.

As the gates had not been officially reopened yet, people couldn’t enter. Although some waited at the foot of the mountain, the more impatient ones camped right in front of the gates, eagerly waiting for them to open.

As a result, even before the reopening ceremony began, the atmosphere in Wudang was already heating up.

A hundred years ago, the Wudang sect had been utterly destroyed.

The centuries-old halls and buildings, which had withstood countless trials, were now reduced to rubble or burned to ashes.

The devastation was so complete that not a single building could be saved.

With little external aid, the surviving disciples of Wudang had to rebuild everything from scratch.

They scraped usable materials from the rubble, laid new foundations, and raised pillars upon them.

Brick by brick, tile by tile, the disciples rebuilt the halls with their own hands.

In this way, the Wudang Sect stood up for themselves without any outside help. The dozen or so halls that now formed the core of Wudang were all built this way.

The True Immortal Hall was one of those rebuilt halls.

Originally built to honor the sect’s founder, it now served as the meeting place for Wudang sect’s leadership.

Inside the True Immortal Hall, two elderly Taoists with graying beards sat facing each other across a table.

One sat with the upright posture of a pine tree, his eyes sharp and piercing. The other had a round, amiable face reminiscent of a rice cracker, wearing a warm, gentle smile.

Just like their appearances, the two had very different temperaments.

The sharp-eyed master exuded a cold, blade-like aura, while the other radiated a soft warmth that felt like it could embrace everyone.

The kind-faced master was the first to speak.

“Sect Leader.”

“Go ahead, Brother Cheongun.”

“We’ve almost finished the preparations.”

“You have been working hard! It couldn’t have been easy to get everything ready in such a short time. As expected, Wudang wouldn’t work without you.”

“Whew! I’d really like to rest now. Age is catching up with me.”

“Don’t be absurd. This is only the beginning, and you’re already talking about rest?”

“I was just saying. No need to get worked up, Sect Leader.”

“When we’re alone, call me Senior Brother.”

“Senior Brother Cheongsong.”

“That sounds much better.”

The Taoist called Cheongsong finally smiled, he was the current sect leader of the Wudang Sect.

The warm-faced Taoist across from him was Cheongun, Cheongun’s junior brother and a trusted advisor, known for his sharp mind and insight. Without Cheongun’s help, Cheongsong would never have dared to host such a grand reopening ceremony.

Cheongsong stood and walked to the window.

When he flung it open, the full view of Wudang’s grounds came into sight.

Though much of its former glory had been restored, empty plots still dotted the landscape—sites of halls destroyed a century ago that to be rebuilt.

Such were the limitations of a secluded sect.

Originally, Wudang had planned to restore its former glory behind closed gates. But growing without outside support had proven too difficult.

That’s why Cheongsong had made the bold decision to reopen the gates.

Of course, it hadn’t been his decision alone.

The entire sect agreed with him.

The most fervent supporters were the first-generation disciples like Jinghae and Jingyun.

They believed Wudang’s former glory had to be reclaimed.

Secluded training alone had its limits.

So they urged the elders, including Cheongsong, to reopen the sect. And Cheongsong accepted their proposal.

Though some elders cautiously opposed it, Cheongsong ignored them and pushed forward with the ceremony.

“Once the reopening is held, the world will know—Wudang is not dead. The head of the Nine Great Sects still stands.”

“Senior Brother!”

“In my generation, we must showcase Wudang’s might so that future generations can restore—no, surpass—its former glory.”

“Don’t you think we’re moving too fast?”

“Are you afraid?”

“I fear that a single misstep could tarnish Wudang’s reputation.”

“I feel the same. But if we do nothing, nothing will change. You know this well, don’t you?”

“Sigh… I know it in my head, but this heart of mine won’t settle.”

“Don’t worry, everything will be fine.”

Cheongsong’s eyes gleamed sharply as he looked out over Wudang.

When he first joined, reconstruction was still incomplete. He had carried bricks and helped build the halls himself.

There wasn’t a single building that hadn’t been touched by his hands. His love for Wudang ran deeper than anyone’s.

“Wudang will reclaim its glory. If not in my time, then in the next. But for that to happen, this gate-opening must succeed. We must show the world that Wudang lives.”

“But it still bothers me.”

“You?”

“Must we really sacrifice someone as a scapegoat?”

“Don’t talk nonsense.”

“We’ve been forgotten for a hundred years. To the world, we’re just fragments of the past. If we want to reclaim our place in the Jianghu, we must make a shocking statement.”

“……”

“Don’t falter. Don’t be ashamed. I’ll bear all the filth. You just keep moving forward for Wudang’s future. If you don’t trust me, trust Jinghai. He is Wudang’s future.”

“Sigh!”

Cheongun exhaled deeply.

Though he had resolved himself, his heart wavered countless times a day.

‘If only Senior Brother Cheongheo were here to stand with us…’

He thought of a man he had personally exiled.

A man who embodied Wudang’s spirit more than anyone—yet whose ideals diverged from most of the sect’s Taoists. Thus, they had no choice but to part ways.

Just as a shadow fell over his eyes-

“Sect Leader, it’s Jingzhen.”

The voice of first-generation disciple came from outside.

Cheongsong turned.

“Enter.”

At his permission, a middle-aged Taoist stepped in. It was Jingzhen, one of the first class disciples

“What is it?”

“He has entered Dengzhou.”

“Really?”

“Yes! A secular disciple in Dengzhou confirmed it. But…”

Jingzhen trailed off.

His unusual behavior made Cheongsong frown.

“What’s wrong?”

“Well… he clashed with the Five Yin Demon Hand.”

“The Five Yin Demon Hand? Jang Hwak?”

“Yes.”

“But Senior Brother—”

“Do you not?”

“I… do.”

“Good! That’s enough.”

With that, Cheongsong firmly closed his lips, signaling an end to objections.

Cheongun’s eyes flickered uneasily.

‘Is that really enough?’

But his voice never left his lips.

The Jeongong Escort Agency left Dengzhou early in the morning.

Though Lee Gwak and had drunk heavily the night before, their schedule didn’t change.

Lim Ji-moon, who had left on business, only returned panting just before they were leaving.

Whatever he’d been doing all night, his eyes were bloodshot.

“Heh heh.”

Lim Ji-moon answered with an awkward grin.

Lee Gwak didn’t ask further.

If Lim Ji-moon had stayed up all night, there must have been a good reason.

“You’ll get a chance to nap once we board the boat to cross the lake.”

“That’s the plan.”

Once they crossed the lake, they would arrive at Sibeon.

It was the final destination of the escort job and Lee Gwak’s true destination—a place akin to Wudang’s backyard.

With the boat, they’d arrive in Sibeon by afternoon at the latest.

At the harbor, the Jeongong Agency escorts were busy trying to hire a boat.

The dock was crowded with martial artists.

Most of them had come to witness Wudang’s gate opening. Although some of them had formal invitations, most of them had rushed over without one.

All of them were now waiting to catch a boat to Sibeon.

Even the large vessels that usually traversed the lake, along with fishing boats pressed into service, weren’t enough to meet the demand.

Because of that, even Jeongong Escort Agency had a hard time securing a boat.

Only after paying far more than the usual fare were they finally able to get one.

“Whew…”

Only after safely loading the cargo onto the ship did Oh Jung-gyeong finally let out a sigh of relief.

It felt like the tension he’d been carrying had suddenly lifted.

It felt like the tension he had been holding onto was finally released.

Even if someone were after the cargo, he doubted they would dare to cause trouble in front of so many martial artists.

Moreover, Lee Gwak was right beside him. It seemed safe enough to relax a little.

Suddenly, his gaze fell on Lee Gwak, standing alone at the bow of the boat.

Lee Gwak stood at the bow, letting the wind wash over his entire body. Even though the waves were rough and the boat rocked considerably, Lee Gwak remained as steady as if his feet were glued to the deck.

Oh Jung-gyeong followed Lee Gwak’s gaze.

He could see the Wudang Mountain.

Even from a distance, it radiated a sacred and mystical aura.

It was a place neither he nor Jeongong Escort Agency had permission to enter but it was Lee Gwak’s true destination. The gap between himself and Gwak felt wide, but Oh Jung-gyeong didn’t feel ashamed. Instead, it fueled his determination.

“One day, I’ll grow Jeongong Escort Agency to a level that you won’t be ashamed of.”

His clash with Jang Musan had reaffirmed it.

In the world of Jianghu, only those with great strength could make their voices heard.

He didn’t possess the martial power to do so himself. In that case, he would have to grow his organization to that level.

He now had yet another reason to expand the Jeongong Escort Agency.

After gazing at Lee Gwak a little longer, Oh Jung-gyeong turned and went inside the cabin.

He wasn’t the only one. The escorts and guards of the agency, including Im Jimun, also went inside to rest.

Only the sailors and Igak remained on the deck.

Suddenly, a gleam flashed in Lee Gwak’s eyes.

It was because of a ship that had entered his line of sight.

It looked like an ordinary ship, just like the one he was on. But the people aboard were anything but ordinary.

When Lee Gwak focused his internal energy into his eyes, he was able to clearly make out the individuals onboard.

His eyes briefly narrowed with recognition.

Among them were people he knew well.

“Thousand Kingdom School…?”

Members of the Thousand Kingdom School, one of the Seven Great Sects, were walking around on the deck. Lee Gwak recognized some of them.

Then—

Suddenly, their deck erupted into commotion.

Several people pointed at Lee Gwak and began chattering excitedly. It seemed they had recognized him too.

Among them, one particularly beautiful woman gazed at Lee Gwak with delight.

She ordered the boatmen to steer closer to Lee Gwak’s ship.

As the large boat carrying the members of the Thousand Kingdom School approached, the waves surged, causing Lee Gwak’s boat to rock violently.

“What’s going on?”

“What’s happening?”

The Jeongong Escort Agency members, who had been resting in the cabin, rushed out in alarm.

Seeing the approaching boat, they instinctively drew their weapons.

Thud!

Finally, the large boat pulled up alongside Lee Gwak’s.

A young woman peeked over the high railing, her face lighting up.

“Hero Lee! It really is you!”

She called out to Lee Gwak cheerfully.

Lee Gwak recognized her at a glance.

“Miss Namgung.”

The woman was none other than Namgung Yeon-hwa, daughter of Namgung Jin-geom, leader of the Thousand Kingdom School.

With a light jump, she gracefully landed on Lee Gwak’s boat.
