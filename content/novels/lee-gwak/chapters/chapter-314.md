Oh Cheol-geuk opened his eyes.

He had a strange, unpleasant dream but couldn’t recall its contents.

It wasn’t the first time he’d had such dreams, yet this one left him feeling unusually foul.

Driven by a sense of discomfort, he threw off his blankets and rose.

Besides him, two new concubines lay naked. Perhaps their lovemaking the previous night had been too intense; they looked near-unconscious in their sleep.

Seeing their fair skin rekindled his lust, but Oh Cheol-geuk dismissed the urge and dressed himself.

He quietly stepped outside.

It was still before dawn.

The Green Heaven Society was shrouded in deep darkness.

Torches were lit here and there, but they were insufficient to fully dispel the darkness enveloping the society.

Oh Cheol-geuk sighed softly.

Starting from nothing, he had built a formidable force within a few years, yet he remained unsatisfied.

“Tsk! If only I had managed to recruit Sura Blade, conquering Sky High Castle wouldn’t have just been a dream.”

He clicked his tongue in frustration.

Yesterday, he had heard an unbelievable rumor: that Lee Gwak had single handedly laid waste to the Nine Dragons Clan.

At first, he couldn’t believe it. The Nine Dragons Clan was a dominant force that had ruled the Jianghu for nearly a hundred years—utterly different in caliber from the Green Heaven Society, which had merely gathered mobs to swell its ranks.

The rumor that Lee Gwak alone had humiliated the Nine Dragons Clan shocked him.

His lifelong dream was to surpass the Thousand Kingdom School—especially Sky High Castle. Yet no matter how many followers he gathered or how many martial artists he recruited, challenging Sky High Castle still seemed out of reach.

What’s the point of having a large army of subordinates? Most of them are just a bunch of clowns.

Especially since he lacked a sufficient number of true masters.

Thus, Oh Cheol-geuk had not yet dared to challenge the Sky High Castle.

If only he had someone of Lee Gwak’s calibre, he could try it much sooner. That’s why he regretted not recruiting Lee Gwak back then.

“Was I too hasty? Instead of sending assassins, I should have negotiated more…”

After Lee Gwak rejected his recruitment offer, Oh Cheol-geuk, in a fit of anger, had hired the Black Assassination Group to eliminate him. By now, he’d almost certainly discovered that Oh Cheol-geuk had been the one behind the attempt on his life.

Now, re-offering him a position would surely be rejected.

Oh Cheol-geuk shook his head, about to head back to his room, when suddenly—

“Oh Cheol-geuk, master of the Green Heaven Society, correct?”

A cold voice came from behind him.

A chill ran down his spine.

This was the Green Heaven Society’s territory.

Even if his martial arts skills were subpar, he had numerous subordinates, all standing guard in an impenetrable perimeter.

No one should have been able to slip in and approach him so silently. And yet the owner of the voice had appeared behind him without anyone noticing.

Oh Cheol-geuk felt his mouth go dry, but he managed to look calm and turned around.

“Such audacity, to visit uninvited at this late hour. It seems you underestimate me greatly.”

“Heh! Seems the thief has grown quite bold from carving out a small force.”

“What?”

Taken aback by the unexpected insult, Oh Cheol-geuk was startled. But when he saw the man’s appearance, he felt his blood run cold.

The man who had infiltrated the Green Heaven Society was a young, handsome martial artist.

His features were so perfectly sculpted, as if fashioned by a master artisan polishing fine jade, that it caused involuntary admiration.

Oh Cheol-geuk’s brow twitched.

He was certain he had never seen this face before, yet he felt he had heard of someone with such features. However, he could not recall where.

One thing was certain: This visitor hadn’t come in peace. The cold precision in his gaze told Oh Cheol-geuk exactly that.

Puffing himself up, Oh Cheol-geuk asked, “And you are?”

“Jin Woo-seon.”

“What?”

“Are you deaf? I said my name is Jin Woo-seon.”

“You can’t mean Jin Woo-seon of the Zealous Justice Clan?”

“That’s right.”

Oh Cheol-geuk’s face went ashen.

The Zealous Justice Clan was one of the so-called 10 sects.

When Ja Hong Cheon of the Jade Heaven Alliance drew his sword against the Jianghu, the Zealous Justice Clan was the first to be annihilated—faster than anyone had expected.

Nobody had imagined that a clan belonging to the 10 sects could be destroyed so quickly, which made it all the more shocking.

Jin Woo-seon had been the young master of the Zealous Justice Clan.

After the annihilation of the Zealous Justice Clan, Jin Woo-seon had disappeared, and everyone assumed he was dead.

“H-How are you still alive…?”

“I had a good friend who saved me.”

“What do you mean?”

A twisted smile crept onto Jin Woo-seon’s lips.

In Jianghu, he was known as the Jade Kirin.

In the northern lands where his clan was based, there was no late-blooming genius stronger than Jin Woo-seon. Among the younger martial artists, he was undoubtedly the best, and even among the established martial artists who had already made a name for themselves, there were not many who could be said to be clearly above him.

There was a time when he was so drunk with fame that he thought he was the greatest, but it was Go Geom Wol who brought him the pain of defeat.

Defeated by Go Geom Wol, he realized there would always be someone stronger.

Determined to reclaim his honor by beating Go Geom Wol, he initially stayed close to him to figure out his weaknesses. However, over time, he became captivated by Go Geom Wol’s character, and they eventually became friends.

When the Zealous Justice Clan was destroyed by the Jade Heaven Alliance, he was with Go Geom Wol, which saved his life but left him feeling guilty for not being with his master.

During the last three years, not a day passed that he didn’t think about vengeance. If it weren’t for Go Geom Wol, he would have pursued that revenge recklessly long ago.

Oh Cheol-geuk asked, “Why have you come here? My Green Heaven Society has no quarrel with you.”

“Heh, that’s true. There’s no grudge between us.”

“Then why?”

Jin Woo-seon’s lips curved into a faint smirk.

“I need the Green Heaven Society for my friend’s sake.”

“What are you talking about?”

A sense of foreboding shuddered through Oh Cheol-geuk, and his fears were not unjustified.

“I mean to take the Green Heaven Society for us.”

Killing intent flared in Jin Woo-seon’s eyes as he stepped toward Oh Cheol-geuk.

Forced back by his overwhelming aura, Oh Cheol-geuk retreated—but then ground his teeth and halted.

The Green Heaven Society was everything to him—the culmination of his life’s work.

He wouldn’t let a man he’d only just met snatch it away from him, even if that man was part of the Ten Lesser Skies.

“I don’t know what you’re plotting, but you’re mistaken if you think the Green Heaven Society will be taken so easily,” Oh Cheol-geuk growled.

“All you have is a bunch of weaklings.”

“Argh!”

The sneer in Jin Woo-seon’s voice made Oh Cheol-geuk’s face contort in rage. Normally, he would have lashed out without thinking, but this time he held back and instead shouted loudly as he backed away,

“Where is the Green Shadow Corps?”

His voice, amplified with internal energy, echoed across the compound, and soon a hundred or so of the Green Shadow Corps came running—the Green Heaven Society’s most elite martial artists.

“Master!”

“You called for us?”

The martial artists of the Green Shadow Corps surrounded Jin Woo-seon.

“Kill him.”

“Yes!”

They responded without question.

They didn’t know why Jin Woo-seon was here or his purpose, but a command from their leader was all they needed to act.

Shaa!

The hundred martial artists charged at Jin Woo-seon simultaneously.

A cold smile spread across Jin Woo-seon’s face.

It had been three years.

Three years of brooding since the Zealous Justice Clan had fallen so disgracefully.

He had honed his martial arts skills in secret under Go Geom Wol’s shadow, harbouring poison in his heart, all to take revenge on the Jade Heaven Alliance.

“This is only the beginning.”

His signature sword technique, the Soul-Chasing Phantom Blade, began to unfold.

A dance of beautiful yet sinister death swept towards the Green Shadow Corps.

“Ugh!”

Watching the display, Oh Cheol-geuk’s face lit up with terror.

***

“Ugh! I miss Daddy.”

Lee Soo-ah sat on a large rock, face scrunched up as if she was about to burst into tears.

At first, she had been all right.

Even without her father or Lee Cheong around, she’d been too busy exploring all over to feel lonely. But after a while, no matter what she did on her own, it all became dull.

She loved being with her mother, Han So-cheon, but she was still bored.

“I miss Daddy. I miss Cheong, too.”

Lee Soo-ah flopped onto the rock, staring up at the bright blue sky. Clouds drifted overhead

Somehow she thought she saw her father’s face among them, so she squinted and strained her eyes. Of course, she didn’t see him – it just made her eyes hurt.

Eventually, tears welled up in her eyes as she sat up again.

“Tch!”

Lee Soo-ah trudged toward the hut, her shoulders slumped in dejection.

“Are you back?”

“Mom!”

Han So-cheon greeted her. Without a word, Lee Soo-ah wrapped her arms around Han So-cheon’s waist.

Puzzled for a moment, Han So-cheon soon realized what was wrong and pulled Lee Soo-ah’s head close, embracing her gently.

“Our Soo-ah, you must miss Dad.”

“Yes!”

“But why didn’t you follow him?”

“Cheong needs to see the world too.”

Lee Soo-ah answered without lifting her head from her mother’s waist, her voice muffled, but Han So-cheon understood every word.

“Why don’t you go down with Cheong then?”

“Then Mom would be lonely.”

“You’re so thoughtful, our Soo-ah.”

Han So-cheon tenderly stroked Lee Soo-ah’s hair. Eyes closed, Lee Soo-ah savored the warmth radiating from her mother. After a moment of enjoying the comfort, she abruptly lifted her head.

“I’m okay now! I feel better again. Heh-heh!”

“That’s a relief!”

Han So-cheon smiled at Lee Soo-ah, who returned the smile as they made eye contact.

As the mother and daughter enjoyed their time together, someone appeared from behind the distant Bear Rock. He was as tall as the rock itself, making him clearly visible from afar.

Han So-cheon’s expression stiffened slightly.

Since Lee Gwak and Cheong had gone out into the Jianghu, no guests had come to this place, nor was there anyone expected.

With a wary gaze, Han So-cheon stared at the enormous, bear-like man.

He paused to glance around, then strode purposefully toward the small hut.

Han So-cheon’s gaze narrowed.

They were deep within the Qilian Mountains, a remote location unknown to most. Hardly anyone could wander in by accident, and it was even less likely that someone would deliberately seek them out.

Yet the tall man seemed to know exactly where he was going, his steps unhesitant as if he had known the place’s existence beforehand.

That meant he knew they were here, and had probably located them beforehand.

“Soo-ah!”

“Yes, Mom?”

“Stay back.”

Hearing the seriousness in Han So-cheon’s voice, Lee Soo-ah turned her head to look at the man approaching them.

Her expression stiffened, much like her mother’s. She might have been young, but she was by no means naïve.

Lee Soo-ah quietly slipped away from Han So-cheon’s side and went into the cottage.

Meanwhile, Han So-cheon remained where she was, watching as the hulking figure drew closer.

He was a man of imposing stature and formidable presence, walking with a swagger as if he were out on a leisurely stroll.

When he finally got near, Han So-cheon spoke first.

“Stop right there.”

“Hmph.”

The man halted with a peculiar hmph.

“Who are you?”

“Je Mu-hyeok.”

He offered his name without hesitation.

Suspicion flickered in Han So-cheon’s eyes; she had never heard this name before. Then the man laughed.

“Ha ha! You wouldn’t know my name. But perhaps your husband might remember.”

“Do you have a connection with my husband?”

“Just a passing one. Perhaps your husband doesn’t even remember my name.”

“Why would you come here if the connection is so fleeting?”

“To give him a warning.”

“A warning?”

“Yes! A warning.”

Je Mu-hyeok grinned crookedly.

Han So-cheon’s face hardened even more.

“Is it as they say, ‘The righteous do not come, those who come are not righteous’?”

Indeed, “The good do not come, and those who come are not good.”

This was especially true for an unannounced guest in a place like this.
