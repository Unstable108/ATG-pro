Han So-cheon and Ki Jin-hwi were heading north at a rapid pace.

Since they already knew that Lee Gwak and the children were at Mt. Yeo, there was no need to waste time searching for them. However, they couldn’t blatantly use the well-maintained official roads.

Hidden Blood Squad was persistently tracking them. If they used the official roads, they would quickly be detected by the enemy’s information network.

They used small paths and mountain passes to avoid prying eyes, and traveled diligently with little rest.

They substituted rest with occasional cultivation exercises, and their meals consisted of pre-prepared dry food.

They slept very little and even moved at night.

As a result, they covered an enormous distance in just two days—a distance that would have taken a normal person at least five days to walk.

Yet, their expressions were far from bright.

A large river loomed ahead, blocking their path.

The river’s width spanned more than 200 jang. It was too wide to cross using their qigong, swimming, or water techniques, and the current was swift and fierce.

Han So-cheon was relatively better off. Having trained as an assassin, she had learned how to hide in water and use the currents to her advantage, practicing various water techniques. However, that was only possible in calm waters, and she couldn’t guarantee her safety in such violent rapids.

On the other hand, Ki Jin-hwi was utterly hopeless when it came to water. He was like a rock with arms and legs; the moment he entered the water, he would sink straight to the bottom.

In the end, they abandoned the idea of swimming across the river and decided to search for a boat. After combing through an area of over 20 li, they found a fisherman who made his living catching fish in the river.

The fisherman’s boat was tiny, just big enough for two or three people to sit in. Because of this, the fisherman was reluctant to take them.

This boat was his only means of livelihood, and if the boat sank while carrying the two, he would be left with nothing.

“Then sell me the boat,” Ki Jin-hwi said, pulling out five silver coins from his sleeve when the fisherman hesitated to give them a ride.

The fisherman’s eyes widened at the sight of the silver coins.

Five nyang of silver was more than enough to buy several boats like his. The fisherman quickly took the silver and handed over the boat, eager to close the deal before Ki Jin-hwi changed his mind.

“Damn it!”

After a few strokes of the oar, Ki Jin-hwi cursed under his breath.

He had no experience handling a boat, and oaring required a certain technique. He was simply using brute force, causing the boat to barely move forward.

“I’ll do it.”

Unable to watch any longer, Han So-cheon stepped in.

Though she wasn’t as skilled as the fisherman, she was far better than Ki Jin-hwi.

As soon as she took over the oar, the small boat began to cut through the rough waters.

“This is embarrassing, Miss Han.”

Ki Jin-hwi scratched his head with an awkward expression.

“It’s okay.”

“Well then, I’ll shamelessly take some rest.”

“Please do.”

Han So-cheon nodded as she continued to row.

It had been a while since she last rowed, so it was awkward at first, but after a little time, she became much more skillful. Still, she couldn’t relax.

The boat was too small—far too small. She was worried whether such a small boat could make it through the rough currents to the other side. The closer they got to the center of the river, the stronger the currents became, and the boat rocked violently.

To stabilize the boat, Han So-cheon summoned her internal energy, but it had little effect due to the boat’s small size.

“Ugh!”

Ki Jin-hwi grabbed the boat tightly with a terrified face.

If the boat capsized, he was as good as dead. His face, usually unflinching, had now turned ghostly white.

“Don’t worry. The boat won’t capsize.”

“I sure hope so.”

Han So-cheon’s reassurance was of no use.

Ki Jin-hwi’s grip on the boat only tightened further. Han So-cheon, too, forced a calm expression, though she was just as tense.

Rowing consumed an enormous amount of stamina. Because of that, Han So-cheon’s face was already flushed red, and she was gasping for breath. She was barely holding on thanks to her internal energy; otherwise, she would have collapsed already.

At that moment, Han So-cheon’s eyes changed. She sensed something unusual.

Swish!

Almost instinctively, she drew her sword and swung it forward.

Clang!

With a metallic sound, something fell helplessly into the boat.

“An arrow?”

Ki Jin-hwi’s eyes narrowed.

He quickly stood up and looked in the direction from which the arrow had come.

“Is that…?”

It was a large boat that looked like it could carry at least dozens of people. He didn’t know when they had started following them, but they had gotten quite close.

While their small boat was being violently tossed by the current, the large boat remained stable.

“Hidden Blood Squad…”

Han So-cheon’s face darkened when she saw the people aboard the large boat.

They were members of Hidden Blood Squad, the group she had once belonged to. The ominous aura radiating from their bodies made it clear.

“Sigh…”

Han So-cheon let out a sigh.

Despite all their efforts to shake them off, Hidden Blood Squad had caught up.

The way she thought, her habits, her escape routes—all were things she had learned from Hidden Blood Squad. What she knew, Hidden Blood Squad also knew. Everything she could think of, they had anticipated.

On the deck of the large boat stood Hidden Blood Squad’s leader, Cheol Geuk-jin, along with Cheol Gwan-ho and Li, Mun-hye. They had once been comrades who had shared life and death with Han So-cheon.

Cheol Geuk-jin’s eyes gleamed coldly as he stared at the small, struggling boat ahead of them—specifically at Han So-cheon, who was holding the oar.

“So… Cheon…”

At first, they didn’t know the identity of the assassin they were pursuing. But after pursuing for so long, they began to notice many similarities.

Not only in killing methods but also in thinking patterns, choosing escape routes, and utilizing the surrounding environment—all were surprisingly similar to the Hidden Blood Squad.

She had tried to introduce variations, but that didn’t change the fundamentals.

That’s when Cheol Geuk-jin began to suspect that their target might be an assassin who had once belonged to Hidden Blood Squad. There was only one person who had left Hidden Blood Squad alive—Han So-cheon, who had been presumed dead six years ago.

Now, he had finally confirmed his suspicions.

Han So-cheon, realizing she could no longer hide her identity, turned and stared directly at Cheol Geuk-jin.

There was still a considerable distance between the two boats, but their sharp eyesight allowed them to recognize each other’s faces.

“Leader…”

Han So-cheon bit her lip.

Having once served under him, she knew better than anyone just how ruthless he was. She had learned all her assassination techniques from Cheol Geuk-jin.

Even though she was known as the “Assassin King,” she could not be certain of victory against Cheol Geuk-jin alone.

The distance between the two boats was narrowing rapidly. In less than a quarter of an hour, they would be caught.

A decision had to be made.

“Master Ki!”

“Yes, Miss Han?”

“Take the oar.”

“Miss Han?”

Ki Jin-hwi looked at her in surprise, and she gave him a bitter smile.

“I’ll leave the boat. Then they’ll abandon the boat and chase me instead.”

“I can’t allow that! We live or die together—I can’t leave you behind!”

“I’ll never forget your kindness, Master Ki. But this is the best way for both of us to survive. If you happen to meet my husband, please tell him this one thing: Not a single day passed when I didn’t love you. I thought of you always.”

“No! You tell him yourself! I…”

Ki Jin-hwi couldn’t finish his sentence.

Splash!

Han So-cheon leaped into the river without hesitation.

Water splashed onto Ki Jin-hwi’s face.

He stared blankly at the turbulent river where she had plunged in. The water was so murky d that he couldn’t see anything beneath the surface.

“Damn it!”

Ki Jin-hwi grabbed the oars and opened his eyes wide.

His eyes were already bloodshot.

“What have I been doing all this time, not even learning how to swim, you idiot!” he cursed himself.

He was furious at his own inability to help Han So-cheon any further. But he gritted his teeth and rowed as hard as he could.

Though inexperienced, he rowed with all his strength.

The boat rocked violently, as if about to capsize.

“Leader!”

He had to make it across the river. He had to find Lee Gwak.

Thwip! Thwip!

At that moment, several figures from the Hidden Blood Squad boat dove into the water. Seeing Han So-cheon escape into the river, they had launched their pursuit.

Watching them, Ki Jin-hwi felt helpless.

Cheol Geuk-jin’s boat no longer pursued Ki Jin-hwi. Instead, it turned toward the lower reaches of the river.

Whoosh!

A sword cut through the water.

Han So-cheon barely avoided it and twisted her body away.

She felt sluggish in the water. Although she had trained in water techniques, she had never fought in such violent rapids.

The same was true for the Hidden Blood Squad assassins.

Their water techniques were limited to hiding underwater with breathing tubes for days or stealthily infiltrating enemy positions via water. None of them were used to moving like fish in such fierce currents.

Nevertheless, they jumped in without hesitation and attacked Han So-cheon.

She immediately retaliated.

Even though she wasn’t able to move freely in the water, she swung her sword with all her might. But the water’s resistance slowed her movements to less than half their normal speed.

Clang!

Swords clashed underwater, causing both martial artists to flail.

Without solid ground to stand on, even a slight impact made it hard to maintain balance in the water. Because of that, the assassin from the Hidden Blood Squad couldn’t easily regain his balance and flailed his limbs. In contrast, Han So-cheon recovered her balance faster.

After leaving Hidden Blood Squad, Han So-cheon had gained experience through countless assassinations. Those experiences were now helping her compensate for her limitations.

Swish!

Several figures approached from all directions, cutting through the water. More Hidden Blood Squad assassins had surrounded her.

“If I get surrounded, it’s over.”

Han So-cheon quickly backed away.

The water was murky, making it impossible to see more than a few feet ahead. Debris from upstream, including large logs and rocks, made it even more dangerous.

Thud!

One of the Hidden Blood Squad assassins was hit by a large log and disappeared into the murky water.

Han So-cheon closed her eyes.

In the turbid waters where she couldn’t see an inch ahead, there was a limit to what she could see with her eyes. It was better to close her eyes and trust her senses.

Swish!

Swords cut through the water from all sides, but none of them touched her.

Han So-cheon was adapting quickly to the water. She was adjusting far faster than the Hidden Blood Squad assassins.

“I need to use the flow of the water.”

She swung her sword while entrusting her body to the flow of the water. She had learned to conform rather than resist.

Shing!

“Urgh!”

An Hidden Blood Squad assassin, unable to block her sword, had his throat cut.

Underwater, unable even to scream, the assassin died.

A hole opened in the formation. Without hesitation, Han So-cheon darted through the gap.

The assassins quickly tried to close the circle again, but by then, she was already gone.

She swam away, using her water techniques to escape.

Staying to fight underwater any longer would be of no advantage to her. Fleeing as quickly as possible was the smarter option.

Her decision was quick, and her actions were even quicker.

The murky water would soon hide her from view if she could just put some distance between them.

Just as she was speeding up—

Whoosh!

A sword energy of an entirely different magnitude cut through the water, headed straight for her.

Han So-cheon didn’t even dare to dodge. She swung her sword to block the attack head-on.

Boom!

The water around her exploded from the impact.

The force of the attack was so strong that a vacuum briefly formed in the water, slamming into her body with tremendous power.

“C-captain…”

Blood trickled from Han So-cheon’s lips.

Just one strike had given her severe internal injuries.

Only one person in Hidden Blood Squad possessed such overwhelming martial prowess.

Cheol Geuk-jin. He had entered the water himself.

“So-cheon!”

Like a dragon, he sliced through the water with terrifying speed, heading straight for Han So-cheon.

She realized she couldn’t escape anymore.

Boom!

Underwater, they clashed.

A whirlpool formed around the point of impact, swirling the water violently.

“You’ve grown a lot.”

Cheol Geuk-jin showed a regretful expression.

There weren’t many assassins with such talent. If she had remained under him, there would have been many ways to make use of her, so it was regrettable that they met again as enemies.

But then his eyes hardened with killing intent.

He could not tolerate a discarded weapon like her turning against the Jade Heaven Alliance.

“Sleep forever beneath these waters, So-cheon!”
