Dan Li-Yeon knelt before Ja Hong-cheon.

“Please help me, Master. I can’t live like this anymore.”

A slight tremor ran through Dan Li-Yeon’s shoulders.

At one time, she resented Ja Hong-Cheon.

She couldn’t bear the criticism for becoming the Blood Martial Empress due to Ja Hong-Cheon’s ambition. But now that she had consumed all her innate qi and become no different from a cripple, she understood. Such pain was nothing more than a child’s tantrum.

The helplessness of not being able to do anything and the frustration of having reached the end of her usefulness drove her to despair.

Compared to that feeling of despair, the resentment she felt towards Ja Hong-Cheon was nothing.

A faint smile formed on Ja Hong-cheon’s lips as he watched Dan Li-Yeon struggling in despair.

This was exactly what he wanted for her.

‘Frustration weakens people, and despair renders them powerless. Only then do they abandon their pride and offer true loyalty.’

Dan Li-Yeon possessed unparalleled talent. But her ego was too strong. So she could not truly follow Ja Hong-Cheon; she only obeyed because it was her master’s command.

Only after losing everything was Dan Li-Yeon ready to follow Ja Hong-cheon.

Ja Hong-cheon asked, “If you do as I say, you will become stronger than before. But in doing so, you may lose much of your humanity. Are you okay with that?”

“I’m… fine. No, it doesn’t matter,” Dan Li-Yeon replied firmly.

“Good. Then enter the Nine Tribulations Cave. There, you will be reborn as the true Blood Martial Empress.”

“The Nine Tribulations Cave?”

“It’s a place I’ve arranged for you. Only for you…”

“Thank you, Master.”

Dan Li-Yeon stood up and bowed to Ja Hong-cheon.

She bowed a total of nine times.

It was only now that Dan Li-Yeon truly accepted Ja Hong-cheon as her master – the master she had so resented and hated.

Ja Hong-Cheon pointed to an old man behind Dan Li-Yeon and spoke,

“Follow him. He will guide you to the Nine Tribulations Cave.”

“Yes, Master.”

After bowing her head deeply in gratitude to Ja Hong-Cheon, Dan Li-yeon followed the old man.

As he watched her receding figure, a deep smile spread across Ja Hong-cheon’s lips.

“Now, a proper sword is being prepared.”

What he needed was a butcher.

A butcher who would swing a large sword without hesitation toward the enormous ox called the Jianghu.

Dan Li-yeon would become an excellent butcher.

“Should I be grateful to Lee Gwak for this?”

As he thought of Lee Gwak, Ja Hong-Cheon’s eyes turned cold.

He spoke as if it didn’t bother him, but thinking of Lee Gwak always left him feeling unpleasant.

Putting aside the fact that he was once an outer hall squad leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance, the damage he had inflicted was not insignificant.

It wasn’t enough that he lost Go Jeon-ok, the lord of the Dark Moon Pavilion, and the Ghost Sword Squad; even Dan Li-Yeon was defeated. The loss of power was one thing, but his reputation had hit rock bottom. On the contrary, Lee Gwak’s fame was soaring to the sky.

For Ja Hong-cheon, it was a situation that was beyond displeasing—it was infuriating.

He wanted to find and kill Lee Gwak immediately, but there were more important matters at hand.

Ja Hong-cheon quietly headed somewhere.

The scenery inside the Jade Heaven Alliance was so desolate that it felt eerie. Just a few years ago, the Jade Heaven Alliance had been bustling with people, both in the outer and inner court.

It was always crowded with people wanting to join, and wealth from all over the world was concentrated here. Such was the formidable influence of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Even now, the prestige of the Jade Heaven Alliance hasn’t diminished. But as the war dragged on, negative perceptions were widespread. Perhaps because of that, the number of people wanting to join the alliance had visibly decreased.

But Ja Hong-cheon was not worried.

This desolate scenery was merely a temporary phenomenon. The moment the Jade Heaven Alliance conquered and unified the remaining Seven Sects, countless people would flock here again, and it would once more be bustling.

This was merely a transitional period.

Once this moment passed, the Jade Heaven Alliance would again become the center of the world.

Thinking so, Ja Hong-Cheon moved forward.

After walking for some time, he arrived at one of the most secret places within the Jade Heaven Alliance.

The Secret Court.

It was one of the main halls and the place where all the strategies of the Jade Heaven can Alliance were formulated.

As Ja Hong-Cheon appeared, the martial artists guarding the main gate of the Secret Court all knelt on one knee and shouted, “We greet the Lord!”

Ja Hong-cheon nodded indifferently and passed them by.

No one dared to stop him. There was no one within the Jade Heaven Alliance who could dare hold him back.

Soon, he arrived at a place located in the deepest part of the Secret Court.

When Ja Hong-cheon arrived, the dozen martial artists guarding the entrance all knelt on one knee.

Thud!

“We greet the Lord!”

From their entire bodies, a mighty aura emanated as they bowed their heads to Ja Hong-cheon.

Their martial prowess was too valuable for mere gatekeepers. It would be much more efficient to deploy them on the battlefield. But neither those guarding the place nor Ja Hong-cheon, who had ordered them, thought so.

Because the person inside was that important. To monitor and guard him, some of the alliance’s top elites were stationed here.

Ja Hong-cheon spoke, “How is he?”

“He is inside, reading a book.”

“Has he still not changed his mind? Open the door.”

“Yes!”

One of the martial artists opened the door.

Ja Hong-cheon entered without hesitation.

As soon as he stepped into the room, the door closed with a heavy sound.

Inside the room, a middle-aged man with handsome features was sitting on a chair, reading a book.

Even though Ja Hong-cheon had entered, the man didn’t lift his head and continued reading.

But Ja Hong-cheon sat across from him without showing any displeasure.

“Have you still not changed your mind?”

“Oh! The Lord is here.”

Only then did the man close the book he was reading and acknowledge him.

With a gentle smile on his lips, the man raised his head. He was none other than Yeo Joong Wol, the master of the Secret Court and a genius strategist.

Yeo Joong Wol looked at Ja Hong-cheon with deep, penetrating eyes. Ja Hong-cheon’s gaze, meeting his, was colder than ever.

“How long will you continue to defy my orders?”

“Defy your orders? What a frightening accusation…”

Yeo Joong Wol widened his eyes as if hearing it for the first time.

That attitude grated on Ja Hong-cheon’s nerves.

Yeo Joong Wol stood up casually and brought over a tea set.

He carefully selected well-dried tea leaves and put them into the teapot, then boiled water. The series of actions flowed so naturally that even Ja Hong-cheon felt no discomfort.

As Yeo Joong Wol poured the well-brewed tea into the teacup, he said,

“As you know, I am spending my ‘Twilight Years.’ During the Twilight Years, I don’t have to concern myself with any matters within the alliance.”

“Are you really going to continue like this?”

“As you know, this is a regulation established by the first Lord. And I am using this regulation for the first time, so I can rest for another two years.”

At Yeo Joong Wol’s calm reply, for the first time, Ja Hong-cheon’s eyes wavered.

It had already been three years since he started the war to unify the martial world. If Yeo Joong Wol had helped him formulate strategies, the war would have ended long ago. But Ye Joong-wol had invoked the bizarre regulation called the Twilight Years and defied his orders.

Indeed, there was a clause called the Twilight Years in the alliance’s regulations. But it was meant to accommodate elderly martial artists nearing retirement, not someone like Yeo Joong Wol, who was in his prime.

According to the regulations, key personnel could utilize the Twilight Years for up to five years.

Ye Joong-wol had utilized this clause.

As soon as Ja Hong-cheon started the war, he entered his Twilight Years and stopped all activities. It was a situation that even Ja Hong-cheon had not anticipated.

Originally, Ye Joong-wol had been opposed to the war. Nevertheless, Ja Hong-cheon could push forward because Ye Joong-wol had sworn loyalty to the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Under the Lord’s authority, he would have no choice but to follow orders. But Ye Joong-wol was defying his orders by using the Twilight Years as a shield.

The problem was that there was no appropriate way to punish Ye Joong-wol. So the only solution he could think of was to confine Ye Joong-wol to his quarters to prevent him from going outside.

Ja Hong-cheon had tried several times to convince Ye Joong-wol. But each time, Ye Joong-wol refused his demands, citing the Twilight Years. Ye Joong-wol had also cleverly sent his disciples Lim Sobo and her brother outside, so he couldn’t even use them as hostages.

Now, even Ja Hong-cheon’s patience was reaching its limit.

The validity period of his agreement with Jin Gwang-hon, the leader of the Celestial Demon Troupe, was three years, and that period was coming to an end.

He was not afraid of the remaining Seven Sects, but he was concerned about how the Celestial Demon Troupe would act once the agreement expired.

Because of that, it was true that he had been feeling anxious lately.

After silently staring at Yeo Joong Wol for a moment, Ja Hong-cheon spoke.

“If you continue to be uncooperative, I too will no longer try to persuade you.”

“……”

“Well, perhaps I no longer need your strategies. From now on, I will conquer the Seven Clans with overwhelming force.”

“Lord Leader! May I offer one piece of advice?”

“No, don’t. Aren’t you in your Twilight Years? Naturally, you have no authority to give me counsel.”

Ja Hong-cheon stood up.

Yeo Joong Wol looked at him with eyes filled with pity.

As he walked away, Ja Hong-cheon spoke to his subordinate.

“It seems this place doesn’t suit the military advisor. Move his quarters to the dungeon.”

“Understood!”

“If you change your mind, let me know anytime.”

“That won’t happen.”

“Hmph! We’ll see about that.”

Ja Hong-cheon’s subordinates grabbed Ye Joong-wol’s arms and moved him to the dungeon.He watched Ye Joong-wol’s receding figure for a moment, then stepped outside.

As he came out, he was greeted by a scholar who appeared to be in his early fifties.

Dressed in a sky-blue robe with a headband tied tightly, his face was both cold and intellectual. His eyes were sharp, as if they could see through one’s innermost thoughts like crystal-clear glass, and his unique tense atmosphere naturally made others feel nervous.

There was only one martial artist in the Jade Heaven Alliance with such a distinctive aura and presence.

Joo Shin Yoon, the Inner Court lord.

He bowed his head and greeted Ja Hong-cheon.

“Has Yeo Jung-wol still not changed his mind?”

“His stubbornness is tougher than iron.”

“It can’t be helped. By the way, what brings you here in person?”

“I have urgent news to report.”

“Go ahead.”

“We have detected suspicious movements in the Celestial Demon Troupe.”

Ja Hong-Cheon frowned.

“What do you mean? Are they perhaps mobilizing their forces?”

“Not that, but…”

“I don’t like word games.”

“Apologies. It’s just that it’s so subtle.”

“Subtle?”

“Yes! There’s definitely some movement inside, but we’re not sure what it means. We’ve tried sending spies to investigate, but every single one has been exposed and eliminated.”

“What are the odds that it’s nothing?”

“It’s the Celestial Demon Troupe. Nothing that happens inside can be considered insignificant.”

“Indeed! I momentarily forgot that fact.”

The three years he had promised were already coming to an end.

The period of truce he had implicitly agreed upon with Jin Gwang-hon was already over. It wouldn’t be strange for the Celestial Demon Troupe to move again.

“Find out what’s happening inside the Celestial Demon Troupe.”

“It is difficult through normal means.”

“Then are you saying it’s possible through abnormal means?”

“Yes! So I need your approval. It seems there will be many casualties…”

“Proceed! No matter how many die, no matter how many are sacrificed…”

He needed more time.

To buy the time he needed, it didn’t matter how many were sacrificed.

A chilling energy appeared in Ja Hong-cheon’s eyes.

***

The day of the martial arts tournament arrived.

Since early morning, the Grand Martial Arena of the Nine Dragons Clan was teeming with countless martial sects, creating a sea of people.

It was the first grand festival to take place in the northern region since the annihilation of the Zealous Justice Clan. Expectation was evident on people’s faces.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong were standing among the multitude.

Seeing the endless crowd, Lee Cheong wore an expression of awe. It was his first time witnessing such an enormous gathering in one place.

Being still short, all Lee Cheong could see were people’s chests and backs.

At that moment, Lee Gwak lifted Lee Cheong onto his shoulders. Suddenly, his field of vision opened up.

“Wow!”

Unconsciously, Lee Cheong let out an exclamation at the endless sea of people.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Just then, a huge drum sounded, and people stepped onto the platform.

All eyes turned toward the individuals on the stage.

Immediately, the crowd let out an exclamation.

“Wow! It’s the Blood Sea Divine Sword, Grand Hero Gyeong Un-cheon!”

“It’s the Sect Master!”

The first martial artist to step onto the platform with a majestic demeanor was none other than Gyeong Un-cheon, the supreme leader of the Nine Dragons Clan.

Following behind him was a young martial artist.

Even among the multitude of martial artists, he radiated a distinct presence—the young master of the Nine Dragons Clan, Eun Moo-young.

As the two ascended the stage, a thunderous roar erupted.

Thus, the first day of the martial arts tournament began with the appearance of these two figures.
