A middle-aged martial artist wiped the sweat from his brow and sat down on a small rock.

As soon as his butt touched the stone, a sigh escaped his lips.

“Huu! This is killing me. I really have to quit this job as squad leader.”

He muttered to himself and looked around.

Within a radius of about ten jang from him, there were twenty martial artists. All of them wore the same exhausted expression as the middle-aged man.

“Well, they must be tired as well. We’ve been sleeping on the ground for days. This damned war needs to end soon so we can stop suffering.”

This middle-aged martial artist’s name was Seok Yi-cheon, the leader of the 17th Squad of the Outer Hall of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

His eyes were bloodshot.

For the past several days, neither he nor the 17th Squad had been able to sleep properly.

They had been forced to camp out day and night, but more importantly, the nature of their mission made it impossible to rest.

Their current location was the plains near Jiwon.

Their mission was to support the activities of the Heavenly Intelligence Hall.

Normally, the Outer Hall of the Jade Heaven Alliance wouldn’t venture out to perform missions. Even if they did, they would return immediately to the main alliance once the mission was complete.

But this time was different.

Due to the simultaneous wars with the Seven Sects, there was a shortage of manpower throughout the Jade Heaven Alliance. They might have plenty of martial groups at their disposal, but they lacked sufficient support personnel.

In times like these, the Outer Hall was extremely useful. They could be deployed wherever manpower was lacking without much burden.

That’s why Seok Yi-cheon’s 17th squad had been dispatched to Jewon.

They weren’t the only ones.

The 19th squad was also deployed not too far away.

Licking his dry lips, Seok Yi-cheon murmured,

“I miss Cheon-gwang and Il-yeong.”

The captain of the 19th squad was Go Cheon-gwang, and the vice-captain was Woo Il Yeong.

They had all previously belonged to the 13th squad with Seok Yi-cheon.

Now scattered, each one led a squad or served as a deputy, but the bond between them remained strong.

They had all grown strong under Lee Gwak’s command, and based on that experience, they now led their respective squads admirably.

The Outer Hall was notorious for frequent casualties and high turnover in personnel, but both the 17th and 19th squads were still holding strong under their leadership, without suffering any serious losses.

While Seok Yi-cheon had grown close with the members of his current squad, they still couldn’t compare to his colleagues from the 13th squad.

Knowing that the two were nearby was a considerable comfort to him.

“Still, why aren’t those bastards coming? Because of their delay, we are suffering here.”

The martial artists from the Heavenly Intelligence Hall who had gone to gather information should have rejoined them long ago.

Normally, they should have joined up three hours ago. Delays were common in intelligence work, but they’d never been this late before.

That’s why Seok Yi-cheon’s nerves were on edge.

If something had happened to the Heavenly Intelligence Hall, it would fall upon him to lead the 17th out of there.

‘Gwak must have felt this burden too.’

The more he served as a squad leader, the more he understood how much Lee Gwak must have worried.

Suddenly, he longed to see Lee Gwak.

He had heard rumors that Lee Gwak had returned to the Jianghu after spending three years in seclusion. Seok Yi-cheon didn’t know why Lee Gwak had re-entered Jianghu.

Their circumstances had changed too much, and he couldn’t even mention that he knew Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak was a respected martial artist in the Jianghu while he was just an outer hall squad leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance. But the Lee Gwak he knew didn’t discriminate on the basis of social status.

Lee Gwak was a man who moved by heart. That made him all the more endearing and all the more missed.

“Huu!”

As Seok Yi-cheon let out a sigh, his Vice Captain approached him.

“Squad Leader!”

“What is it?”

“There’s someone approaching.”

“Someone? Is it the Heavenly Intelligence Hall?”

“No, I believe it’s the Nineteenth Squad.”

“The Nineteenth Squad?”

Seok Yi-cheon stood up from the rock with a puzzled expression.

Although the 19th was close by, the 17th and 19th each had their own missions. It was unthinkable for any of them to leave their positions and move without specific orders.

Soon he heard a familiar voice calling from the direction of the approaching 19th Squad.

“Brother!”

It was Go Cheon-gwang, the leader of the 19th Squad, calling out cheerfully as he approached.

His vice-captain, Woo Il Yeong, was with him.

They were old comrades who had shared life and death as part of the 13th Squad. Seok Yi-cheon embraced the two with delight and asked,

“What’s going on? Are you allowed to leave your post?”

“A new order came down from above. They told us to join the 17th squad immediately and move out.”

“Move?”

“Yes! The elite forces of the main faction are moving south, and the 17th and 19th squads are to join them.”

“No news from the Heavenly Intelligence Hall?”

“They seem to have already joined the elite forces.”

“What exactly is going on?”

“Phew! How would I know?”

Go Cheon-gwang sighed.

In the time they hadn’t seen each other, his face had noticeably thinned—a sign of the mental strain he had been enduring.

Just like Seok Yi-cheon, he deeply cared for his squad members and had been constantly worrying about their safety. Although there were hardly any sacrifices among his squad members, the emotional toll on him was indescribable.

Knowing Go Cheon-gwang’s heart, Seok Yi-cheon comforted him.

“You’ve been through a lot too.”

“Brother, it can’t be harder than what you’ve gone through. Still, it’s good to see you again like this.”

“I feel the same. Being together like this brings back old memories….”

When Seok Yi-cheon smiled, Go Cheon-gwang smiled along with him.

Watching them, Woo Il-yeong muttered absentmindedly,

“If only Squad Leader, Jin-hwi, and Cheon-wol were here, it’d be just like the old 13th squad. I wonder what they’re all doing now….”

***

Lee Gwak returned to his lodgings with Lee Cheong.

The two of them brazenly opened the door and walked inside, spotting Nam Woo-gyeong lying on the bed.

“Uncle!”

Lee Cheong hurried towards Nam Woo-gyeong.

“Cheong, you’re here.”

“Are you okay, uncle?”

“Not really. But the poison has been somewhat neutralized, so I should recover soon.”

Nam Woo-gyeong forced a smile.

Thanks to the antidote Lee Gwak had administered, the immediate crisis had passed, but full recovery would take time.

It was impractical to think of safely escaping the Nine Dragons Clan with Nam Woo-gyeong. Thus, Lee Gwak chose to hide Nam Woo-gyeong under the protection of Nine Dragons Clan instead.

It was a move that caught the enemies off guard.

Lee Gwak’s gamble paid off.

The Nine Dragons Clan would never suspect Nam Woo-gyeong to be hiding in the very guest quarters they had provided, and only searched outside. Thanks to this, Nam Woo-gyeong was gradually regaining his strength in the safety of Lee Gwak’s lodging.

Lee Gwak set down the food he had been hiding and spoke,

“You must be hungry; eat this first.”

“Thank you.”

The food was provided free of charge to those who had come to watch the martial arts tournament.

As the poison was neutralized, Nam Woo-gyeong felt a severe hunger and devoured the food Lee Gwak had brought.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong also sat down and ate gradually. Fortunately, there was enough food for all three to fill their stomachs.

“Huu! I feel alive again.”

Nam Woo-gyeong put down his chopsticks, a hint of color returning to his pale face.

Leaning against the wall, he asked, “What’s the situation outside?”

“They’re still searching secretly.”

“Secretly?”

“Yes! It seems they can’t search openly because of their guilt.”

“It’s fortunate for us. If they had searched openly without regard for people’s gaze, we would have been discovered quickly.”

“They won’t be able to continue like this. Too many people are entering the Nine Dragons Clan now.”

“Indeed, the Nine Dragons Clan cannot ignore public opinion either. It would be disastrous if the martial arts competition they held became futile.”

Determination returned to Nam Woo-gyeong’s eyes.

He was still suffering from the lingering effects of the poison, but compared to the peak of his intoxication, this was child’s play. As the young master of the Hao Clan, he was already regaining his calm and reason.

“I never expected Eun Mu-young to commit such a bold act. It was my mistake to consider him a normal person.”

“Brother!”

“It’s alright! I might have been deceived once, but it won’t happen a second time.”

“Do you plan to confront the Nine Dragons Clan head-on?”

“Well, we’ll see. But one thing is certain: the Nine Dragons Clan and Eun Mu-young will definitely pay for this incident, in one way or another.”

Nam Woo-gyeong’s gaze was as cold as ice.

Lee Cheong swallowed hard at the chilling look in Nam Woo-gyeong’s eyes.

It was the first time Lee Cheong had seen such a fearsome side to Nam Woo-gyeong, who usually had a friendly smile. It felt all the more alien.

Nam Woo-gyeong than smiled at Lee Gwak

“Anyway, I owe you a great debt again.”

“There’s no need for debt. It’s only natural.”

“Most people would have ignored what you consider natural. You really are a good person.”

“You too……”

“Anyway, I will definitely repay this kindness. So let me rely on you for a while.”

“You don’t have to repay me.”

“I can’t do that. Even if the Hao Clan is struggling, I have the means. So don’t refuse.”

“Understood.”

Lee Gwak had no choice but to agree.

Only then did Nam Woo-gyeong look satisfied and closed his eyes.

Seeing Lee Gwak and his son, Nam Woo-gyeong finally allowed the sleep he had been resisting to take over.

“I’ll take a little nap. Is that okay?”

“Yes! Rest well without worry.”

“Thanks, Gwak!”

Nam Woo-gyeong’s voice faded, and soon a steady breathing filled the room.

He had fallen asleep.

Lee-gwak watched Nam Woo-gyeong’s serene face for a moment before turning to Lee-cheong.

“You did well today. I didn’t realize your martial arts had improved so much.”

“Hehe!”

Lee Cheong couldn’t hide his delight at Lee Gwak’s praise.

The fact that he was recognized by Lee Gwak made him happier than the results of the competition.

Lee Cheong looked at Lee Gwak silently for a moment.

Lee Gwak read the intense desire in his eyes.

“Do you have something to say?”

After hesitating for a moment, Lee Cheong spoke up.

“Dad, now that it has come to this, I want to do my best in the finals too.”

“Do you want to win?”

“Yes!”

Lee Cheong answered without hesitation. But he had thought over these words countless times.

Initially, his attendance at the martial arts competition was meant to create an opportunity for Lee Gwak to save Nam Woo-gyeong.

As a guardian of a competitor, Lee Gwak could move around inside the Nine Dragons Clan without arousing suspicion. Indeed, this had made it easier for Lee Gwak to rescue Nam Woo-Gyeong.

If they stuck to the original plan, it would have been best for him to lose or forfeit now, allowing them to leave the Nine Dragons Clan without raising any suspicions.

Lee Cheong was well aware of that, so he felt guilty for asking Lee Gwak, but the fire in his heart that Nam Jin-woon had ignited was not easily extinguished.

Lee Gwak looked at Lee Cheong silently for a while.

Lee Cheong did not shy away from Lee Gwak’s gaze.

Looking at Lee Cheong, biting down hard, suddenly reminded him of his own childhood.

Lee Gwak himself had only found that kind of burning determination after he’d passed twenty. Before that, he had simply accepted and adapted to the reality given to him, content with how things were.

Compared to that, Lee Cheong seemed to have already set his course at a much younger age.

Lee Gwak’s lips, tightly sealed until now, curved gently into a smile.

“Let’s do that, then.”

“Pardon?”

At first, Lee Cheong thought he had misheard. He blinked, dumbfounded.

Seeing that innocent reaction, Lee Gwak’s smile deepened.

“Since it’s come to this, do your best in the finals as well.”

“Can I really participate?”

“Haven’t I already said you could?”

“But…”

Lee Cheong’s gaze drifted toward Nam Woo-gyeong, who was sleeping off to the side.

He worried that his own ambitions might cause them to miss the window to treat Nam Woo-gyeong and escape from the Nine Dragons Clan.

“Don’t worry about your uncle. I’ll take care of him. You just focus on giving it your all in the competition.”

“Yes!”

Only then did Lee Cheong nod vigorously.
