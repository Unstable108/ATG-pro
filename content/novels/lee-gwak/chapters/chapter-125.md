Yong Cheon Myeong’s eyelids trembled slightly.

To others, it might have looked like a simple blow, but Yong Cheon Myeong’s strike was infused with the power of four divine realms.

A martial artist of Yong Cheon Myeong’s caliber, having infused a punch with four divine realms, could shatter a boulder as large as a house into sand.

Even the peak masters of Jade Heaven Alliance couldn’t confidently block such a tremendous force easily.

And yet a mere Outer Hall Squad Leader blocked my four realm infused attack?

Yong Cheon Myeong felt his blood run cold.

Blinded by jealousy, he had made a choice he shouldn’t have, but he was by no means a fool. A fool wouldn’t have been chosen by Ja Hong Cheon, nor would he have maintained his position as the first disciple.

“Have you been hiding your martial arts abilities?”

“What purpose do you have for concealing your martial skills and operating in secret within the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

Yong Cheon Myeong’s words were cunning.

With just a few sentences, he framed Lee Gwak as a spy with hidden motives within the Jade Heaven Alliance.

The faces of the people looking at Lee Gwak were filled with distrust.

The martial artists present were all proud of their strong martial arts skills. They were shocked that the martial prowess of a mere Outer Hall Squad Leader could come close to theirs.

A dragon could emerge from a small stream.

Even a worm, through cultivation, can become a dragon.

However, the idea that the Jade Heaven Alliance was the stream from which a dragon ascended was unacceptable. Even more so if the dragon had been wriggling beneath their feet.

Lee Gwak could see the hostility in their eyes. But what mattered to him now was not the emotions in their gazes.

He suddenly felt a pang of sadness.

It saddened him that the man Geum Yul Seon had chosen was only of this caliber, and that the likely future leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance now seemed far less capable than he had thought.

Lee Gwak let out an involuntary sigh.

The sigh, laden with many meanings, dissipated quickly into the wind, but its resonance lingered.

Yong Cheon Myeong’s eyes flickered slightly.

He felt a sudden sense of shame, realizing his words had been excessive. But the situation had gone too far. To change his stance now would undermine his own authority.

He raised his voice.

“What purpose do you have in the Jade Heaven Alliance? Answer me now, Lee Gwak!”

“To survive…”

“I joined the Jade Heaven Alliance to survive.”

“Is that supposed to be an answer?”

“At fifteen, I lost my parents to a plague. I starved, eating nothing, and with no one to take me in, I was forced to flee my hometown and wander the lands. The world was filled with danger, and there was no place for an orphan like me to rest peacefully. Then the Jade Heaven Alliance announced that they were recruiting martial artists. For a starving orphan, it was like a lifeline from heaven. So I joined the Jade Heaven Alliance. To live, not to starve…”

Lee Gwak’s voice was incredibly calm, yet it carried a profound resonance.

Unlike Yong Cheon Myeong, who had been chosen from birth and followed a path of success, it encapsulated the hardships of someone who had struggled from the very bottom.

Hearing his words, some martial artists felt an unexpected heaviness in their hearts. They instinctively recognized the truth in Lee Gwak’s statement.

Lee Gwak continued,

“A few years ago, Celestial Demon Troupe’s delegation came to the Jade Heaven Alliance. You might not remember, Lord Yong, but during that visit, a martial artist from Celestial Demon Troupe, upset for some trivial reason, brutally assaulted a low-ranking outer hall martial artist, leaving him crippled.”

Silence followed.

“That was me. Because of Gwan Gwan Il Hyeon’s outburst, I was left paralyzed and unable to move, neglected by the Jade Heaven Alliance with only formalities addressed. For a whole year…”

Seo Jong Myeong’s eyebrows twitched.

It was the past of Lee Gwak that he had tried to ignore.

He knew Lee Gwak had been paralyzed, but he did not know it was Gwan Il Hyeon who had caused it.

‘Lee Gwak!’

Suddenly, Seo Jong Myeong felt a pang of guilt.

Lee Gwak continued, “At that time, I had only one thought: I wanted to move. I wished to move even a single finger at my will. But my body wouldn’t respond as if it wasn’t mine, and the Jade Heaven Alliance gave me no hope. Then I came across an opportunity to learn a martial technique, and fortunately, I was able to recover. After that, I learned whatever martial arts I could find. You might think the martial arts I’ve learned were paid for by someone, but everything I’ve achieved is the result of desperately learning to survive.”

Lee Gwak’s calm voice was filled with coldness, and the power to put people to shame.

A few martial artists who met Lee Gwak’s gaze lowered their heads in shame.

They had never been as desperate in their martial arts training as Lee Gwak

“I entered the Jade Heaven Alliance to live and trained desperately in martial arts to move. Is that so suspicious?”.

“To become strong with just low-level martial arts that are barely taught to outer hall martial artists? I can’t believe that.”

“It’s not necessary to learn famous or prestigious martial arts from the Jianghu to become strong.”

“Don’t try to deceive me with such nonsense, Lee Gwak!”

Yong Cheon Myeong’s voice boomed.

He did not believe Lee Gwak’s words.

From the beginning, he had a negative view of Lee Gwak, considering everything he said to be sophistry.

Lee Gwak’s words were beyond his understanding.

Yong Cheon Myeong’s eyes, filled with hostility, paralyzed his reason. No matter what Lee Gwak said, it didn’t reach his ears.

“I will have you taken back to the Jade Heaven Alliance for investigation. It would be wise for you to surrender without resistance, Lee Gwak!”

Yong Cheon Myeong openly emitted killing intent, causing the faces of the delegation to turn pale.

They stepped back, distancing themselves from Yong Cheon Myeong’s killing intent.

Lee Gwak’s gaze turned towards Seo Jong Myeong, seeking mediation.

Seo Jong Myeong nodded and stepped forward.

“Calm down, Cheonmyeong!”

“Move aside.”

“We’re still within enemy territory. Nothing good will come from this here. We can settle our differences when we return to the alliance.”

“I told you to move, Lord Seo!”

“Cheon Myeong!”

“It’s an order.”

“Don’t do this. It’s unlike you.”

“Are you defying my command?”

Confusion flashed across Seo Jong Myeong’s face.

Although Yong Cheon Myeong was known to be stubborn, he was not known to be this utterly inflexible.

Even though Yong Cheon Myeong was the Grandmaster of Jade Heaven Alliance, he couldn’t afford to treat Seo Jong Myeong, the leader of the Shadowless Squad, carelessly. Despite Seo Jong Myeong’s modest influence within the Jade Heaven Alliance, his achievements on the battlefield could not be overlooked.

If Seo Jong Myeong wanted, based on his current achievements, he could ascend to a high position within the Jade Heaven Alliance in the future. This would allow Yong Cheon Myeong to exert influence when he will contend for the position of alliance leader.

Knowing this, Yong Cheon Myeong had been somewhat friendly towards Seo Jong Myeong until now.

Seo Jong Myeong had not anticipated Yong Cheon Myeong would be so obstinately unreasonable, which added to his shock and shame.

Seo Jong Myeong’s expression hardened.

“I’m disappointed in you, Cheon Myeong!”

He took a step back and looked at Lee Gwak.

Yong Cheon Myeong realized he had gone too far, but he did not change his stance.

He thought it would be more embarrassing to change his attitude now.

As long as he could subdue Lee Gwak, it would be over.

By overpowering him and uncovering the truth behind him, all the events of today would be forgotten in people’s memories.

Yong Cheon Myeong ramped up his aura on Lee Gwak.

ee Gwak’s gaze deepened.

“What will become of the Hidden Blood Squad?”

“That’s none of your concern.”

“Will they be abandoned?”

“Some will be sacrificed, yes. It’s always been the case that the few are sacrificed for the greater good. They’ve already agreed to this.”

At that moment, Lee Gwak felt his heart sink.

Somehow, he suspected that Han So Cheon would be among those considered ‘some’ by Yong Cheon Myeong.

‘So Cheon!’

Lee Gwak shifted his towards where the 13th squad was.

Ki Jin-Hwi, Seok Yi Cheon, and Cheon Wol were looking at him.

These were the people who had trusted him and followed him here. They were holding him back.

Then, Ki Jin-Hwi’s voice echoed in Lee Gwak’s mind.

―Don’t worry, squad leader. I will take responsibility for protecting the squad members.

Ki Jin Hwi and the squad members were smiling at him.

Lee Gwak looked at each of their faces. Those who met his gaze nodded in understanding.

Their bond was not something built over a day or two.

Though their martial arts skills might be weaker, they deeply trusted each other. They believed there must be a valid reason for Lee Gwak’s actions, even if they did not know what it was.

‘Thank you, everyone.’

Lee Gwak silently expressed his gratitude to his squad who understood him.

Just by exchanging glances, they could read each other’s minds.

Lee Gwak took a deep breath.

A simple action, but the moment Lee Gwak did it, the atmosphere completely changed.

His gaze, posture, and the entire aura around him shifted.

Sensing something formidable, Yong Cheon Myeong ordered Jwa Ryoon,

“Subdue him, Vice Captain Jwa.”

“As you command!”

Jwa Ryoon responded immediately without hesitation.

Regardless of the situation between them, Yong Cheon Myeong was his superior. What he ordered must be carried out.

Jwa Ryoon, accompanied by the Mystic Martial Squad, approached Lee Gwak and declared,

“Outer Hall squad Leader Lee Gwak! As of this moment, your position is revoked, and you are expelled from the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“You are no longer affiliated with the Jade Heaven Alliance, nor are you the Outer Hall squad Leader. Resist, and you will be executed on the spot.”

At that moment, Lee Gwak felt as if the last tie connecting him to the Jade Heaven Alliance had been severed.

Although Jwa Ryoon had spoken thoughtlessly to intimidate him, it became the trigger for Lee Gwak to cut off his last remaining attachment.

Lee Gwak began to walk forward, but Jwa Ryoon and the Mystic Martial Squad blocked his path.

“How audacious!”

Killing intent swirled in Jwa Ryoon’s eyes.

Regardless of the reason, for a mere Outer Hall squad Leader to defy his command was enough to provoke his killing intent.

“Subdue him!”

At his command, about a dozen members of the Mystic Martial Squad moved simultaneously. Lee Gwak’s retinas captured their approaching figures.

The sight of people who were allies just moments ago charging at him with killing intent brought a deep sense of despair to Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak asked himself,

“Am I prepared?”

Was he prepared to harm them to reach Han So Cheon?

Just enduring this once might allow him to continue enjoying everything he had so far.

He could share drinks with his squad, possibly get promoted, and lead a comfortable life with the increased salary in the house provided by the Jade Heaven Alliance.

He just had to bow his head once.

If he kneeled and begged Yong Cheon Myeong for forgiveness, everything would be resolved.

There might be some resentment and a period of investigation, but that was a small price to pay for survival.

Sacrificing one would make the rest easier.

By giving up Han So Cheon, he could gain so much.

Conversely, not giving up Han So-Cheon meant losing too much.

He could lose everything he had built up to this point.

No, it will definitely happen that way.

Would he become a dog that lives within the fence of the Jade Heaven Alliance, fed by others, or a wolf that forsakes a peaceful life to hunt for food in the wilderness?

Was he prepared?

Prepared to be a wolf, starving and searching for food.

Lee Gwak’s hand gripped the hilt of his sword.

The white blade of his sword emerged from its sheath.

His sword cleaved through the air.

Lee Gwak made his choice.

“I will be the wolf.”

He embraced the harsh life of the wilderness.
