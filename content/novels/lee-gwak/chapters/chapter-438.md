The journey to Taeho proceeded smoothly.

The boat carrying Lee Gwak sailed without issue. It stopped at piers and harbors along the way to unload and take on goods and passengers.

Even such moments felt wasteful to Igwak.

If it were up to him, he would have paid the captain extra to sail nonstop to the destination. However, he couldn’t dictate the operations of a boat used by many others just because he was in a hurry.

Lee Gwak steadied his mind.

There were things in the world that could be done by human effort, and things that could not. In this matter, his influence was extremely limited.

He had done all he could. Now, he simply had to wait until they reached their destination.

Although it was difficult to completely empty his mind, he managed to calm down a bit.

Above all, the idea that Ja Hong-cheon was targeting Hao Clan’s leader was merely Lim So-bo’s speculation—there was no concrete evidence.

Lim So-bo could have misjudged the situation. Even if something were to happen, Nam Woo-gyeong and the Hao Clan leader would likely see them through safely.

Nam Woo-gyeong and Sim Wol both had that level of capability.

They were meticulous and had a broad perspective on situations. People like them wouldn’t just sit idly by and wait to be struck down without a plan.

“Hah!”

Lee Gwak turned his gaze to the scenery outside the railing.

The ship he was on was currently passing through a narrow gorge. Steep cliffs rose sharply on either side of the river like folding screens.

Small boats carrying fishermen floated on the tranquil water, and swallows skimmed low across the surface.

It was a picture-perfect view.

Lee Gwak forgot his worries for a moment and became immersed in the landscape.

At that moment, Won Yu-sul approached him.

Sensing his presence, Lee Gwak turned to look, and Won Yu-sul gave an awkward smile.

“I hope I’m not interrupting.”

“Not at all.”

“I just came to say goodbye. I’m getting off at the next dock.”

“Ah! So it’s already time.”

Lee Gwak already knew that Won Yu-sul would be disembarking mid-journey.

In the distance, the dock came into view.

Several ships were already moored at the sizable dock. A large village had formed around it, bustling with people moving about.

That was Won Yu-sul’s destination.

There, he had promised to meet the Steward and accompany him to the Heavenly Martial Manor. His face now showed clear excitement.

Starting anew in a completely different environment was an exhilarating experience for anyone, and Won Yu-sul was no exception.

He held great anticipation for his upcoming life at the Heavenly Martial Manor.

Before long, the boat slowly pulled into the dock.

Thud!

With practiced skill, the captain and crew safely docked the large vessel.

Soon after, the gangplank was lowered, and passengers began disembarking one by one—including Won Yu-sul.

After briefly asking the captain’s permission, Lee Gwak stepped off to see Won Yu-sul off.

Won Yu-sul smiled.

“You didn’t have to do this…”

“Still, it’s a connection worth honoring.”

“Haha! Thank you. I hope we meet again someday.”

Won Yu-sul gave a warm, friendly smile.

Just then, a group of people approached him.

“You’ve arrived safely, Scholar Won!”

The man who greeted him wore a veil covering his face, it was a peculiar sight. He was dressed in luxurious silk, exuding refinement at a glance.

A group of martial artists acting as bodyguards followed behind him. Each of them had sharp eyes that betrayed their extraordinary skills.

Won Yu-sul bowed to the veiled man.

“Ah! Steward Jin!”

“It’s been a while, Scholar Won! You’ve kept your promise and come.”

“Haha! How could I pass up such a great opportunity? Of course, I had to arrive on time.”

“And who is this beside you?”

Commander Jin’s gaze turned toward Lee Gwak.

For a brief moment, his eyes gleamed sharply. Lee Gwak felt an odd sense of familiarity from that gaze.

Lee Gwak tried to focus his vision to see past the veil, but the fabric seemed to be made of heavenly silk—making it difficult to penetrate.

He could break through if he forced more energy into his eyes, but doing so would make his gaze too conspicuous.

Steward Jin was merely a passerby in his life. There was no need to create unnecessary tension with him.

Won Yu-sul had introduced Lee Gwak to Commander Jin.

“Ah! This is a friend I met by chance—Master Lim Jin-mun. Thanks to him, the journey here wasn’t boring at all.”

“Ah, I see. A pleasure. I am the commander of the Heavenly Martial Manor. Just call me Commander Jin.”

“I am Lee Jin-mun. It’s an honor to meet you.”

Lee Gwak clasped his hands in a polite salute.

Steward Jin sighed regretfully.

“Now that we’ve met, why don’t we share a meal together?”

“I apologize, but I have urgent business. Perhaps another time.”

“Urgent business?”

“A personal matter.”

“I see. Then there’s nothing to be done. If you ever pass by the Cheonmujang, please do visit. I’ll make sure to properly host you then.”

“Your words alone are kindness enough. Then, I wish you both well.”

After exchanging farewells with Won Yu-sul and Commander Jin, Lee Gwak reboarded the ship.

By now, the vessel was filled with new passengers.

Soon after, the ship departed the dock.

Won Yu-sul followed Steward Jin with a reluctant expression.

Steward Jin led him to an open area near the dock, where four horse carriages awaited them.

Opening the carriage door, Steward Jin spoke.

“Please board.”

“Wait, we’re taking a carriage again?”

“Yes. We still have a long way to go.”

“Good heavens! Just how much farther…?”

Won Yu-sul boarded the carriage with a weary expression.

As Steward Jin held the door handle, he asked,

“You said his name was Lee Jin-mun?”

“Yes. Why do you ask?”

“Scholar Won, I believe you are mistaken. His name is not Lee Jin-mun.”

“What do you mean…?”

“His name is Lee Gwak. The Sura Blade, Lee Gewak! That is his true name in the Jianghu.”

“Huh?”

Bang!

At that moment, the carriage door slammed shut, cutting off Won Yu-sul’s voice.

Steward Jin had closed it.

Though Won Yu-sul’s muffled voice could still be heard from inside, Steward Jin paid it no mind.

He removed his veil and muttered under his breath.

“Lee Gwak… To meet you here of all places… What a cursed fate.”

His face bore no trace of scarring or disfigurement.

He was strikingly handsome, as if carved from jade.

It was Jin Woo-seon, once known by the nickname “Jade Qirin.”

He had been the young master of the Zealous Justice Clan, one of the Ten Sects, and a member of the Ten lesser skies.

In the northern territories where the Zealous Justice Clan had been based, no martial artist of the younger generation surpassed him. He had been the undisputed strongest among his peers, and even among the established masters of the Jianghu, few could claim to be definitively above him.

But that was all in the past.

The Zealous Justice Clan, his pride, had been utterly destroyed by the Jade Heaven Alliance, and he had faded from the Jianghu’s memory.

Though the Jianghu was known for its changeability, even he hadn’t expected to be forgotten so easily.

But he had neither died nor despaired.

He had merely hidden himself, remaining alive and well, secretly expanding his influence.

“Lee Gwak!”

Jin Woo-seon gritted his teeth.

To him, Lee Gwak was a major obstacle.

He had already lost his friend, Je Mu-hyeok, because of Lee Gwak, and his covert operations had been ruined.

But what angered him most was that Lee Gwak had established the Mad Martial Sect in the former territory of the Zealous Justice Clan.

The Zealous Justice Clan had been everything to Jin Woo-seon.

Though it was now gone, to him, it was like a hometown he would one day return to. And now, Lee Gwak had taken that precious place for himself.

Jin Woo-seon could never forgive him.

His eyes gleamed colder than ever.

“He said he had urgent business, didn’t he?”

He didn’t know the details, but the fact that Lee Gwak had left the Mad Martial Sect alone at a time like this was proof enough that this wasn’t an ordinary matter.

Jin Woo-seon called one of his subordinates and issued an order.

“Send word to the Martial Dragon Squad to delay Lee Gwak.”

“Understood.”

The subordinate bowed and withdrew.

The Martial Dragon Squad was a secret martial force he had formed by gathering remnants of the Green Heaven Association and newly recruited martial artists.

He had originally intended to use them for more important matters later. But letting Lee Gwak go like this was unbearable; it felt as if his chest would burst.

If he could delay Lee Gwak even by a day, if he could hear news of Lee Gwak suffering a setback, it would bring him some satisfaction.

“I swear, I will see the day tears of blood flow from your eyes.”

Lee Gwak watched the receding pier.

The gaze of Steward Jin from earlier lingered in his mind. But soon, he dismissed the thought.

Right now, Steward Jin wasn’t important.

The urgent matter was arriving at Taeho on schedule.

Lee Gwak glanced around the ship.

The deck was crowded with unfamiliar faces, mostly passengers who had boarded at the last dock.

The passengers were a diverse group.

There were merchants, travelers, and even martial artists mingling on the deck.

Once aboard, people relaxed and gathered in small groups to chat, making the ship as noisy as a marketplace. But Lee Gwak didn’t mind.

This wasn’t his first time experiencing something like this—such scenes were commonplace when traveling the martial world.

Leaning against the railing, Lee Gwak closed his eyes.

Though the surroundings were still loud, the moment he shut his eyes, it was as if all sound vanished.

He sank into his own world.

The nearby passengers glanced at the motionless Lee Gwak leaning on the railing, but no one spoke to him.

Thanks to that, he could enjoy his solitude.

After a while, Lee Gwak retreated to his cabin.

Even with the new passengers, the voyage remained smooth.

By evening, the ship entered another gorge.

One of the passengers asked the captain,

“Isn’t it too dangerous to sail through a gorge at night?”

“Haha! No need to worry. Though it’s a gorge, as you can see, the currents aren’t rough. The river just narrows. Nothing to be concerned about.”

“But won’t it be too dark to see?”

“We’ll hang lanterns at the bow. It’ll be fine. I’ve sailed this route dozens of times. I know the terrain here like the back of my hand. Nothing to worry about.”

“Impressive. I’m new to boating, so please excuse my concern.”

The passenger apologized and returned to his companions.

The captain smirked to himself.

“Hmph! What do they take me for?”

There were always a few anxious passengers like this.

Although he treated them kindly outwardly, inwardly, he cursed them for doubting his skills. Of course, the passengers never knew.

A faint, unnatural sound reached the captain’s ears.

“Hm?”

He frowned.

Most passengers had gone inside, and only a few crew remained to manage the ship. So there should be no odd noises.

Screeee…!

The strange sound came again.

“What the hell…?”

One occurrence could be dismissed as imagination, but hearing it twice meant it was real.

The captain called a crewman.

“Hey! Grab a torch and shine it that way.”

“Huh? Why?”

“You son of a bitch, stop arguing and do what I say.”

“Y-yes!”

The crewman lit a torch and grumbled as he walked toward the direction the captain had pointed.

“What the hell am I supposed to see?”

Muttering to himself, he pointed the torch at the water.

“Huh?”

His eyes widened.

There, floating silently, were more than a dozen small boats.

One was drifting directly toward theirs.

Strangely, instead of people, the boat carried something that reeked of gunpowder.

Instinctively, the crewman realized what they were.

“P-pirates!”

Thud!

The next moment, a throwing knife embedded itself between his eyes.

He collapsed into the river, torch and all.

“He fell into the water.”

“Pirates are attacking!”

Nearby crewmen shouted in alarm.

The captain muttered in disbelief.

“Pirates? There are no pirates around here—where the hell did they come from?”

Just then, the small boat carrying the unidentified object collided with the Unmado Riverboat.

KABOOM!

And it exploded.
