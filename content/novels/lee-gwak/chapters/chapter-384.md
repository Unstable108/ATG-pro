Lee Gwak sat cross-legged with his blade, Star Soul, resting on his thighs. He was cultivating, his eyes closed.

Although Lee Gwak never missed a day of training, lately he had been spending more time on cultivation than on physical training.

If martial training strengthened the body, then cultivation tempered the spirit. Lee Gwak faintly understood that training both body and mind was essential for reaching higher realms.

In particular, the Eight Snakes Art he had learned was influenced by one’s mental state.

Therefore, Lee Gwak had been spending more time on cultivation these days.

“Phew…”

Lee Gwak opened his eyes. Sunlight was peeking in through the cracks in the window.

He had spent the whole night cultivating. However, he didn’t feel that it was a waste of time.

After a simple wash, he went down to the dining hall on the first floor.

“Ah, you’re here?”

“Brother!”

Seok Yi-cheon and Cheol Gwang-woo greeted him.

“It seems I am a bit late.”

No! We just came out too. We’ve even ordered your meal.”

“Good job.”

Lee Gwak smiled and took a seat.

Both Seok Yi-cheon and Cheol Gwang-woo looked well rested, their expressions bright. Cheol Gwang-woo, in particular, seemed full of energy, suggesting that he was in excellent physical condition.

While they were chatting, the innkeeper approached with a large tray of food.

The portions were far too generous for breakfast. They had ordered extra to accommodate Cheol Gwang-woo’s appetite.

It wasn’t without reason that Bang Ye-in called Cheol Gwang-woo a bear. His appetite was massive.

Seok Yi-cheon clicked his tongue as he looked at the table filled with food.

“It looks like I’m going to overeat because of this guy from the morning.”

“Hehe! You need to eat well to have strength.”

“Ugh, if only you could talk less…”

Just as Seok Yi-cheon picked up his chopsticks with a sigh, a young voice interrupted them.

“Mind if I join you?”

Lee Gwak paused mid-motion and turned toward the source of the voice.

“So… Bao?”

It was none other than Lim Sobo. Standing beside her was Cheon Wol.

Lee Gwak stood up and asked, “How did you—?”

“Everything that happens in Zangshu reaches my ears. Of course, I heard the moment you arrived.”

Lim Sobo calmly took a seat across from Lee Gwak.

There was something different about her behaviour, and Lee Gwak frowned slightly. . Behind her, Cheon Wol stood stiffly, his lips pressed tightly together.

‘Cheon Wol must have told her about the strategist’s death.’

Lee Gwak closed his eyes briefly.

Seok Yi-cheon and Cheol Gwang-woo exchanged glances.

Instinctively sensing that the atmosphere around Lim Sobo was unusual, they quietly set down their chopsticks.

When Lee Gwak opened his eyes again, he saw Lim Sobo sitting upright.

He took out a neatly folded bundle of paper from his chest pocket. It had been wrapped once in hanji and then again in oiled paper.

Swish.

Lee Gwak slid the bundle over to Lim Sobo.

“What is this?” she asked.

“It’s… the remains of your master.”

At that, Lim Sobo’s eyes quivered with intense emotion.

She knew Ye Joong-wol had died, but never expected Lee Gwak to have gathered his remains. That went for Cheon Wol as well.

When Lee Gwak had cremated Ye Joong-wol’s body, Cheonwol had been unconscious and knew nothing about it.

Lim Sobo bit her lip hard, holding back tears. Her eyes were soon bloodshot, but she managed to hold back her tears.

With trembling hands, she picked up the paper bundle containing her master’s ashes.

“Th-thank you, Oraboni. You must have been in a turmoil, but you still took care of my master.”

“It was only natural. No need to thank me.”

“You haven’t changed at all, Oraboni.”

“What do you mean?”

“The code of the Jianghu has long since vanished, and people often change their allegiance at the first glimpse of profit. But you’ve remained the same person as when I first met you.”

“I’ve changed quite a bit, too.”

“Maybe on the outside or in terms of status. But your upright nature remains the same. And for that, I’m grateful. It allows me not to lose faith in humanity.”

Lim Sobo’s gaze was intense as she looked at Lee Gwak. It was enough to make Lee Gwak want to turn his head away. But he neither averted his eyes nor ducked his head.

Placing the bundle of Yeo Jung-wol’s ashes carefully, Lim Sobo spoke.

“My master’s death is my fault. I pushed too hard to free him, and that cost him his life.”

“It isn’t your fault. He chose that for himself.”

“Still—”

“Don’t blame yourself. Don’t regret it. That’s not what the strategist would have wanted. He hoped his death would become the foundation for you to grow into something greater.”

“You think so?”

“If it were me, that’s what I’d want. If it were me…”

“Thank you. Even if it’s just comforting words, they mean a lot.”

“They’re not just comforting words.”

“I know. You’re not the type to lie for comfort.”

Lim Sobo clenched her small fist.

She had watched over Lee Gwak for over a decade, from when he was a no-name third-rate martial artist. Aside from perhaps Seok Yi-cheon, she might know him better than anyone else.

Lee Gwak was like a pine tree.

Rain, wind, or snow, he stood unwavering in the same spot, unchanged.

The only regret was that back then, he lacked ambition.

Content with what he had, seeking only peace, there was little she could do for him.

A strategist like her thrives under someone with ambition. In that sense, Lee Gwak had been a good brother but not a leader she could serve.

Until now, she had always thought that way. So she had never considered him an option.

But in that time, Lee Gwak had become the most renowned martial artist in the world, his fame blazing like fire.

Of all the people she knew, none had undergone such a dramatic transformation.

“Oraboni!”

“Speak.”

“What kind of Jianghu do you dream of?”

“Hmm. I’ve never really thought about it.”

“Have you never considered changing the Jianghu?”

“I’ve thought about it occasionally, but I’ve never had a concrete plan.”

Lee Gwak answered honestly.

He didn’t know why she was asking, but he saw no reason to hide his thoughts.

“If anything, I’d like to ask you. How can we change the Jianghu so everyone can be happy?”

“Impossible.”

Lim Sobo cut him off.

It was an answer that might have made others flinch, but Lee Gwak simply nodded calmly.

“I see.”

“As long as human desire remains, it’s impossible for one person’s actions to make everyone happy. If it were possible, there would be no more wars in the world—no, in all of history. All we can do is try to ensure that the flow of the Jianghu doesn’t veer into catastrophe or lead to mutual destruction. That’s the most we can do.”

“Prevent mutual destruction?”

“That’s all we have in our power. Whatever the outcome, the first step is to prevent total collapse. That way we can minimize the amount of unhappiness spread throughout the world.”

“Hmm.”

“Oraboni.”

“Yes?”

“Do you want to become a Supreme Ruler?”

“Not at all.”

“Do you want to wield your powerful might and presence to lead the Jianghu?”

“I’ve never considered it.”

“As I thought. You’re far from the type to rule. To end this chaotic era, we need a supreme power to dominate. In that regard, you’d fail.”

“Is that so?”

“You’d fail as a ruler, but as a martial artist, you deserve respect. At least you’d never use your strength to bring misery to others.”

Lim Sobo stared at Lee Gwak intently.

Her eyes were desperate.

“You don’t need to become the Supreme Ruler. The fate of the Jianghu matters, but so does your happiness. But if you truly care about the Jianghu, if you pity its people—even if it goes against your nature, you must become its Supreme. If not that, then at least its unifying force.”

“Unifying force?”

“People think it’s impossible for one person to stand against a major sect. But when an individual’s reputation spans the world, they can achieve the unimaginable. Right now, you’re the only one with that kind of influence. You can unite countless people.”

“Hmm.”

Taken aback by Lim Sobo’s words, Lee Gwak fell silent. He felt as though he’d been cornered. He had come to find answers from Lim Sobo, but never expected her to demand an answer from him in return.

Lim Sobo suddenly rose from her seat and walked over to stand next to Cheon Wol.

“Cheon Wol and I have left the Sky High Castle today. But Lord Po will never let us go willingly. It’s hard for me to say this myself, but I’m a capable strategist. Given the resources, I have the ability to change the world.”

“…”

“I want to dedicate all my abilities to serving under you, Oraboni. I want to end this chaotic era.”

Lee Gwak shut his eyes tightly.

By now, even a fool would understand what Lim Sobo was asking.

Though his eyes were closed, his ears remained open.

Her voice pierced through.

“Is that… not possible?”

Lee Gwak didn’t answer.

Lim Sobo didn’t push any further. She just waited for his answer with her lips parted.

A storm of emotions raged inside him.

In the midst of the chaos, Lee Gwak searched for his true voice.

He tried to listen to the words of his heart.

“…”

And then, he heard them.

Lee Gwak opened his eyes.

Lim Sobo’s desperate gaze bore into him.

“I lack so much. I’m not fit to shoulder the lives of countless people. I have no leadership, no clear vision. All I have is the skill to wield a blade.”

“Oraboni?”

“But if someone like me is acceptable… Will you guide me down the right path?”

“Gladly.”

“Thank you.”

For a moment, Lim Sobo smiled. But soon, she stepped closer to Lee Gwak and bowed deeply.

“Strategist Lim Sobo pledges her service to Lord Lee Gwak, the Great Hero. I swear before heaven and earth to devote my all to assisting my lord.”

The young strategist, who had nowhere to go, had finally found her new lord.

Cheon Wol, Cheol Gwang-woo, and even Seok Yi-cheon looked at Lee Gwak with fervent eyes.

Seok Yi-cheon’s vision was blurred by moisture.

‘Gwak…’

The man he regarded more than a brother had now ascended to the ranks of the Jianghu’s supreme figures.

There was no jealousy—only pride.

Just then—

Rustle.

Movement outside.

Not just one or two people.

Hundreds.

Lee Gwak looked at Cheon Wol, who spoke with a grim expression.

” The Sky High Castle has sent pursuers. They won’t let Sobo go.”

Lee Gwak nodded.

That was enough. He didn’t need further explanation—he could guess the situation.

Lim Sobo looked at him apologetically.

“Sorry, Oraboni. I came to serve you, but I’ve brought nothing but trouble.”

“It’s fine.”

Lee Gwak smiled.

Accepting Lim Sobo meant accepting her grudges as his own.

Her enemies were now his.

And he knew this was a burden he had to bear.

Lee Gwak pushed open the inn’s door and stepped outside.

Hundreds of martial artists surrounded the building.

‘Sky High Castle!’

No explanation was needed.

These were the martial artists from Sky High Castle who had descended from Mount Okhwa.

At their center stood a man in his late thirties.

His black hair was neatly tied back like a woman’s, and he wore green martial robes, hands clasped behind his back.

He looked unremarkable at first glance, but once you looked into his eyes, you could no longer consider him ordinary.

His eyes were strangely white. Where the dark pupils should have been, there was only a pale whiteness.

In all the Jianghu, there was only one man with such striking features.

The “White-Eyed Blood Hand,” So Gun-myeong.

The young master of Sky High Castle and one of the Ten Lesser Skies had arrived with his forces.

His target, of course, was Lim Sobo.
