The slums of Ezhou, overlooking the Dong Lake, hid a secret that most people didn’t know: they were the headquarters of the Hao Clan.

Even the locals of Ezhou, who were accustomed to the abject poverty of their region, could not imagine that the main base of Hao Clan was nestled here.

With so many poor people, most people in Ezhou were reluctant to even approach the slums. As a result, the slums were usually deserted.

It was early in the morning that a change occurred in the quiet slum.

All of a sudden, countless messenger pigeons descended upon the slums.

It was not unusual for messenger pigeons to fly into this place, but for so many to arrive at once was an exceedingly rare occurrence.

The messages carried by these birds all converged on the largest house in the slum. Although “large” here simply meant slightly bigger than the average dwelling, it was a place of great significance to those who lived there.

This modest dwelling was the residence of the leader of the Hao Clan. However, their leader, Shim-wol, was not currently there. Shim-wol had mysteriously left Ezhou one day, and in his place, their young master Nam Woo Gyeong was staying.

“Young Master! Urgent news from Dragon Heaven Valley.”

“News from Martial Sword Troupe.”

“Jade Heaven Alliance is…”

The Hao Clan’s disciples rushed in with the information brought by the pigeons, their faces marked by urgency.

Nam Woo-gyeong frowned as he silently read the notes they had brought.

His face grew more and more tense.

“It doesn’t look good, does it?”

The old man behind Nam Woo-gyeong asked.

The old man had striking golden hair and grey eyes.

In the Hao clan, there was only one man with such distinctive features.

Hwian

He was Nam Woo-gyeong’s master and the strongest martial artist in the Hao clan.

Hwian had joined Nam Woo-gyeong in Ezhou shortly after his arrival.

The news that his beloved pupil had been nearly crippled by the Nine Dragons Clan had enraged him.

He had immediately delegated all his duties to others and came to Ezhou to take care of Nam Woo-gyeong.

Nam Woo-gyeong’s injuries had long since recovered, but Hwi An was not content with that.

He passed on his insights to Nam Woo-gyeong and rigorously trained him. As a result, Nam Woo-gyeong was exhausted every day.

After reading all the notes brought by his subordinates, Nam Woo-gyeong spoke.

“The situation in Dragon Heaven Valley seems unusual.”

“Is it because of the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

“The movements of the Jade Heaven Alliance are suspicious, and the Martial Sword Troupe is also acting strangely.”

“The Martial Sword Troupe?”

“Yes! They’ve secretly mobilized troops, but the problem is we can’t determine their destination.”

“Hmm!”

Nam Woo-gyeong crossed his arms, his expression grave.

Hwi An didn’t speak further. He knew that Nam Woo-gyeong often made this expression when sorting through complex thoughts.

Nam Woo-gyeong closed his eyes and entered deep thought.

Individually, each piece of news wasn’t particularly alarming.

It wasn’t unusual for an organization like the Martial Sword Troupe to move troops secretly, and the same went for the Jade Heaven Alliance. However, the fact that all this news arrived at the same time was the problem.

Nam Woo-gyeong didn’t believe in coincidences.

He wasn’t naive enough to believe in coincidences, nor did he take situations lightly.

Especially after being kidnapped and tortured by the Nine Dragons Clan due to Eun Moo-young, this tendency had only grown stronger.

‘The fact that communication with the Taegang branch has been cut off is clearly related to this situation.’

What concerned him most was that all these events occurred right after Lee Gwak entered Dragon Heaven Valley.

No matter what, if it was related to Lee Gwak, he couldn’t just sit back and wait for news.

Finally, having sorted through his thoughts, Nam Woo-gyeong stood up.

“I need to go to the Dragon Heaven Valley.”

“I’ll go with you.”

Hwi An wasn’t surprised by Nam Woo-gyeong’s sudden decision. He had already anticipated it.

It was Nam Woo-gyeong who was surprised.

“Master, you’re coming too?”

“You’re still too weak for me to feel at ease. I can’t let you get kidnapped and beaten up again, so I’ll accompany you.”

“Haha! Master, you…”

Nam Woo-gyeong made an awkward expression.

“young master!”

The door to the house opened, and an old man with a thick beard entered.

It was Hong Cheon-rak, the guardian of the headquarters.

Hong Cheon-rak briefly exchanged glances with Hwi An.

The two men respected each other deeply.

While Hong Cheon-rak handled the affairs of the headquarters and internal matters, Hwi An protected the Hao Clan from the outside. Though they rarely met, they understood each other deeply and considered each other close friends.

Nam Woo-gyeong looked at Hong Cheon-rak.

“What is it, Senior Master?”

“The young master of the Nine Dragons Clan has requested a meeting.”

“Eun Moo-young?”

“Yes. The Nine Dragons Clan is reaching out to our branches, requesting a meeting with the young master.”

“Hmph! They must be desperate.”

Nam Woo-gyeong scoffed.

He knew why Eun Moo-young was doing this.

Currently, the Nine Dragons Clan was isolated.

The Hao Clan had cut off all information flowing into the Nine Dragons Clan, causing significant disruptions to their external activities.

It was as if their eyes and ears had been shut, leading to severe losses in various areas.

All of this happened because Eun Moo-young had imprisoned and tortured Nam Woo-gyeong. And Nam Woo-gyeong had no intention of forgiving Eun Moo-young or the Nine Dragons Clan easily.

Even if Eun Moo-young had lost an arm and become disabled.

Hong Cheon-rak asked.

“What do you plan to do?”

“Just ignore them.”

“Understood.”

Hong Cheon-rak nodded obediently.

It wasn’t just any matter—the young master of the Hao Clan had been kidnapped by the Nine Dragons Clan and nearly driven to madness. It was a major incident that could have resulted in the Hao Clan’s young master being turned into a puppet controlled by the Nine Dragons Clan.

To expect forgiveness after committing such an act was proof that Nine Dragons Clan did not operate by common sense.

The Hao Clan had no intention of abusing their power, but they also didn’t shy away from the battles they faced.

This was an opportunity to clearly demonstrate the Hao Clan’s strength.

To show just how devastating the consequences of crossing the Hao Clan could be.

Nam Woo-gyeong spoke to Hong Cheon-rak.

“Don’t worry about the Nine Dragons Clan. Focus all your efforts on monitoring the movements of Dragon Heaven Valley and the Martial Sword Troupe.”

“Dragon Heaven Valley and the Martial Sword Troupe? Understood!”

Hong Cheon-rak nodded.

After giving Hong Cheon-rak a few more instructions, Nam Woo-gyeong left the headquarters with Hwi An.

‘Gwak, wait for me. I’m coming.’

Is it true? Has Hundred Eyes Fortress really been taken over by the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

A look of disbelief crossed Mok Seon-wol’s face.

The martial artist reporting the news couldn’t bring himself to look up as he answered.

“I confirmed it just now. Hundred Eyes Fortress has fallen to the Jade Heaven Alliance, and all of Hwang Won plain’s crops have been burned.”

“My God!”

Mok Seon-wol’s legs gave out, and she collapsed into her chair.

The report was that shocking.

Not just Mok Seon-wol, but all the leaders of Dragon Heaven Valley within the hall were appalled.

“Did they really burn all the rice in Hwangwon Plains?”

“What happened to the lord of Hundred Eyes Fortress?”

“Those despicable bastards!”

The quiet hall quickly turned into a chaotic uproar.

The emotion felt by the leaders of Dragon Heaven Valley went beyond shock—it was pure terror.

The fall of Hundred Eyes Fortress to the Jade Heaven Alliance was understandable.

No matter how impregnable a fortress was, there were always weaknesses, and with enough sacrifice, it could be breached.

Dragon Heaven Valley had recognized this possibility and prepared countermeasures.

They were ready to rush to Hundred Eyes Fortress at any moment if a distress signal was sent. But this time, they hadn’t even received any communication.

It meant that the Hundred Eyes Fortress had been taken before they could even call for help.

“To think they burned the Hwangwon Plain to divert our attention…”

Mok Seon-wol was furious at the Jade Heaven Alliance’s scheme.

With the rice fields of Hwangwon Plain completely burned, not only the Dragon Heaven Valley but also the surrounding people were likely to starve during the winter.

It was an atrocious act that could easily designate the Jade Heaven Alliance as a public enemy of the Jianghu, with no excuse to justify their actions.

The problem was that there was no force brave enough to publicly declare the Jade Heaven Alliance as an enemy. Even if Dragon Heaven Valley shouted about them as a public enemy, most people were too afraid of the Jade Heaven Alliance to dare confront them.

“We need to rush to the Hundred Eyes Fortress immediately.”

“If we can’t retake the Hundred Eyes Fortress, the world will look down on us.”

“We must hurry and save those who are still alive, Young Mistress!”

The leaders burned with rage.

The killing intent they radiated filled the great hall.

Mok Seon-wol glanced at them briefly.

It was impossible to calm them down in their current state, nor did she want to.

“I will go to the Hundred Eyes Fortress with five of the Ten Blood Demons and the Iron King Squad.”

Mok Seon-wol spoke with a voice filled with her inner energy. The others raised their voices in response.

“Take me with you, Young Mistress!”

“Our Red Blood Squad will also go!”

Chaos erupted as everyone clamoured to join the mission to Hundred Eyes Fortress.

Their eyes were bloodshot, and they radiated killing intent. Their anger was immense.

The atmosphere was so charged that anyone could be swept up in their frenzy. But Mok Seon-wol remained calm.

“The Hundred Eyes Fortress’s forces were not weak. Lord An Pyeong-san, the lord of the fortress, was a martial artist whose strength rivaled those present here. Yet the Jade Heaven Alliance easily took The Hundred Eyes Fortress. Though they used the scheme of burning the Hwangwon Plain, it’s clear their strength exceeds our expectations. We cannot recklessly attack them without a plan.”

“But Young Mistress…”

“I’m not saying we won’t fight them. Once we’ve assessed their strength and schemes, we can launch a full-scale attack. Everyone in Dragon Heaven Valley will have their chance for revenge, so this time, only I and those I’ve named will go.”

Her calm and composed words gradually quelled the rage and frenzy of those who hadn’t been chosen.

“Then we’ll trust you, Young Mistress.”

“Please ensure we can join the fight once you’ve assessed their strength.”

“Don’t worry. The opportunity for revenge will come to everyone equally.”

With those final words, Mok Seon-wol stepped out of the grand hall.

Drip.

Blood trickled from her lips.

She had clenched her teeth so hard that her gums had been injured. Yet Mok Seon-wol felt no pain.

The anger she felt was great.

The anger she felt was greater and more intense than anyone else in the Dragon Heaven Valley. She was only pretending to be calm because she had to lead everyone.

Mok Seon-wol stroked the metal belt around her waist as she suppressed her anger.

It was a unique weapon called the Snake Belly Sword, made of thin strips of iron intricately woven together.

Inside the thin plates were threads like silver wires or whips, allowing it to hang limply like a belt when not in use. But when infused with internal energy, the plates would connect to form a complete sword.

Its versatility was limitless, but mastering it was equally challenging. Above all, it required immense internal energy to wield effectively.

Touching her beloved Snake Belly Sword calmed her raging heart slightly.

Just then.

“Lady Mok!”

A gruff voice called out.

She turned to see a robust man wearing a band with a black dragon pattern.

The man, with a square jaw, short beard, and sharp eyes, was Woo Mun Pae , the leader of Martial Sword Troupe.

“Young Master, Woo Mun Pae. I have urgent matters, so let’s talk later.”

“Is it about the Hundred Eyes Fortress?”

“How did you know?”

Mok Seon Wol was surprised.

The news that the Hundred Eyes Fortress had fallen to Jade Heaven Alliance was still a highly classified secret. It was shocking that Woo Mun Pae already knew about it.

“Martial Sword Troupe also has eyes and ears. We are aware of everything happening in the region.”

“Hmm!”

Mok Seon Wol was impressed by the Martial Sword Troupe’s intelligence capabilities, exceeding her expectations.

After a brief moment of surprise, she regained her composure.

“This is a matter for Dragon Heaven Valley. Please do not interfere, Young Master Woo Mun Pae.”

“No, it’s our matter as well.”

“What do you mean?”

“It means that since the Dragon Heaven Valley and Martial Sword Troupe have joined hands, it’s our matter. Isn’t it?”

“That’s…”

“The fact that the Hundred Eyes Fortress has fallen to the Jade Heaven Alliance is a serious threat to the Martial Sword Troupe as well. Naturally, I also have the right to know about it.”

Woo Mun Pae ‘s words were thoroughly reasonable.

If they hadn’t formed an alliance, it would be different, but now they had to respond together.

Mok Seon Wol nodded.

“Alright. Let’s go together. But we can’t bring everyone.”

“I understand. I’ll leave half of our forces here and bring only the other half.”

“Do that.”

“Thank you for your permission, Miss Muk!”

Woo Mun Pae smiled.

Mok Seon Wol thought his smile seemed somewhat disconcerting, as if he were enjoying the crisis of Dragon Heaven Valley. But she quickly shook her head to dismiss the unnecessary thought.

“It must be my imagination.”

He was someone who had come to help the Dragon Heaven Valley.

She felt sorry even to doubt such a person.

That day, Mok Seon Wol and Woo Mun Pae set off for the Hundred Eyes Fortress with the elites of their factions.
