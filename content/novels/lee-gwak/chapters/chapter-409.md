The place Lim Ji-mun brought Lee Gwak to was a shabby inn with no signboard. If Lim Ji-mun hadn’t personally guided him, Lee Gwak wouldn’t have believed it was an inn at all.

The inn was so run-down that only a few guests stayed there.

It was the complete opposite of the bustling prosperity of other inns in Sipyeon.

After the news of the Wudang Sect’s opening ceremony spread, large and extravagant inns had sprung up like mushrooms in Sipyeon—and all of them were packed to the brim.

However, the inn that Lim Ji-mun had brought him to still had many empty seats.

Seeing Lee Gwak’s puzzled expression, Lim Ji-mun laughed.

“Haha! Everyone who comes here for the first time makes the same face as you. But the locals love this place. The owner’s cooking skills are out of this world.”

“I’m looking forward to it.”

“You won’t be disappointed.”

Lee Gwak didn’t doubt Lim Ji-mun’s confident statement.

“Welcome.”

A middle-aged woman with a warm expression greeted them from behind the counter.

She was the inn’s owner.

Lim Ji-mun asked her,

“Do you have any rooms left?”

“Of course.”

“How many?”

“Why do you ask?”

“We’ve got more people coming.”

“Ah! There are three small rooms and four large rooms still available.”

“Perfect. We’ll take them all.”

“Really?”

“Yes!”

Lim Ji-mun handed over three silver nyangs as an advance payment. The owner’s face brightened with a smile.

Because the inn was so shabby, it didn’t enjoy the same privileges as others, leaving many rooms vacant. But thanks to Lim Ji-mun, her worries were solved in an instant.

Though locals frequented the place, they only came to eat, not to stay overnight.

Her husband, who worked in the kitchen, didn’t care at all about the empty rooms. He was a born chef—his only interest was cooking.

The only one who ever worried was the owner herself.

Lim Ji-mun turned to Lee Gwak.

“We’ll take one room, and the rest can be used by the Jeon Gong Escort Agency. It’s a bit tight, but it can’t be helped.”

Even though Lee Gwak hadn’t said anything, Lim Ji-mun had already reserved rooms with the Jeon Gong Escort Agency in mind, knowing that other inns were likely to be fully booked.

Lee Gwak smiled.

“The Jeon Gong Escort Agency will be pleased.”

“Well, we’ve been freeloading all the way here. Time to earn our keep. Let’s eat first, we’ll check out the rooms later.”

“Sounds good.”

The two sat down at an empty table.

Lim Jimun ordered some simple dishes and wine, then looked at Lee Gwak.

“Brother.”

“Hmm?”

“Aren’t you scared?”

“Of what?”

“Of the Thousand Kingdom School for one. The Nine Dragons Clan too—they all bear hostility toward you. Aren’t you afraid?”

Lim Jimun recalled the confrontation just before they entered the inn.

Tension between Lee Gwak and the Nine Dragons Clan had reached a boiling point.

If Eun Mu-yeong hadn’t backed down first, they would have clashed head-on.

Right now, it was just the Thousand Kingdom School and the Nine Dragons Clan, but who knew which other sects might hold hostility toward Lee Gwak?

However, Lee Gwak remained unperturbed.

As if he didn’t care about his own life at all.

Going to Mount Wudang was far more disadvantageous than beneficial to Lee Gwak. And yet, he had decided to go without hesitation.

If Lim Ji-mun were in Lee Gwak’s place, he would never have made that choice. That’s why he was curious about Lee Gwak’s thoughts.

Lee Gwak stared back at Lim Ji-mun.

“Of course I’m scared! If I could, I’d avoid it. But I can’t, so I just grit my teeth and move forward.”

“So you do feel fear.”

“I’m still human, after all.”

“That’s reassuring.”

“What is?”

“That you feel like a regular person. Just like me.”

Those who strive to become rulers of the martial world often have ruthless hearts. They care little for what happens to others in pursuit of their goals.

People die, others suffer—it never crosses their minds.

At least, all the contenders Lim Ji-mun had seen so far were like that.

But Lee Gwak was different. He wasn’t so different from ordinary folks like him, and that comforted Lim Ji-mun.

If Lee Gwak had been just another cold-blooded conqueror, Lim Ji-mun would never have followed him.

Lee Gwak chuckled.

“You make it sound like I’m some six-armed monster.”

“Some people might see you that way.”

“For example?”

“Eun Mu-yeong? The way he looked at you earlier was full of fear. Well, you cut off his arm, so I guess it’s natural?”

“I had no choice back then. If I hadn’t, it would’ve escalated into a bigger fight.”

“I’m not blaming you. I’m just glad. That you’re on my side. That you’re not my enemy.”

Lim Ji-mun meant it.

He was glad Lee Gwak was his ally—and his sect leader.

Just then—

“Here’s your food and wine.”

The innkeeper placed the dishes on the table.

The stir-fried pork looked delicious, and a fragrant aroma rose from the liquor bottle.

Lim Ji-mun quickly poured a full cup for Lee Gwak.

“This is the owner’s homemade liquor. It’s not as good as the ones from the Yeon-ga Brewery, but you won’t find anything tastier around here.”

Lee Gwak nodded silently.

He didn’t need to drink it to know the quality. The smell alone told him how much care the owner had put into brewing it.

He took a careful sip.

The taste was so good that his eyes widened.

The aroma, the smoothness, the first taste- nothing was missing.

To Lee Gwak’s palate, it was just as good as the liquor made by the young master of the Yeon Family Brewery.

Just as Lee Gwak and Lim Ji-mun were exchanging drinks—

“Can I have some of that too? It looks delicious.”

Someone pushed open the inn’s door and spoke.

Lee Gwak’s face lit up instantly.

“Brother!”

“Long time no see.”

The man who entered smiled at Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak stood up.

“When did you get here?”

“A few days ago.”

The man grinning at Lee Gwak was none other than Nam Woo-gyeong.

Nam Woo-gyeong naturally took a seat beside Lee Gwak.

He looked at Lim Ji-mun and said,

“Long time no see, kid! You’ve grown a lot.”

“You’ve gotten a lot older too, Ahjussi.”

“I’m still young.”

“And I’m not a kid anymore.”

“Tch. Just like your sister. Full of sass.”

Nam Woo-gyeong chuckled.

Lim Ji-mun laughed as well.

Though the words were rough, there was no malice behind them. The two had known each other since the days of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

After briefly exchanging glances with Lim Ji-mun, Nam Woo-gyeong turned his gaze to Lee Gwak.

“You made quite the entrance. Word of your arrival has spread all over Sipyeon.”

Lee Gwak had encountered both the Thousand Kingdom School and the Nine Dragons Clan as soon as he entered.

It was inevitable that rumors would spread.

As soon as Nam Woo-gyeong heard Lee Gwak was here, he’d made inquiries and tracked him down.

Lee Gwak raised his cup.

“I expected as much.”

“You seem pretty relaxed for someone in your position.”

“It was bound to happen anyway.”

“I suppose…”

Nam Woo-gyeong also took a sip. There was a faint smile on his lips.

He was happy to see Lee Gwak again after so long.

“By the way! I heard you founded the Mad Martial Sect. So you’ve finally ascended to the rank of a grandmaster. Congratulations.”

“People would laugh if they heard you say that.”

“Hah! Who’d dare laugh? Of all the people in Sipyeon, how many have founded their own sect through sheer strength? Most are just riding their family names. You’ve achieved something truly great.”

Lee Gwak turned his head slightly at Nam Woo-gyeong’s passionate speech.

He wasn’t used to others praising him so openly.

Lim Ji-mun agreed with Nam Woo-gyeong.

“He’s right. Your humility is your weakness, hyung. With your accomplishments, even a little arrogance would be understandable.”

“That’s what I’m saying. This guy has no idea how high his standing in the Jianghu really is.”

News of Lee Gwak’s arrival in Sipyeon had put many sects on high alert. Some had even sent people to spy on him. But their efforts had been thwarted by the Hao Clan.

The area around Lee Gwak’s inn was under the control of Hao Clan disciples. It was nearly impossible for other sects to gather information about him.

Suddenly remembering something, Nam Woo-gyeong asked,

“How was Eun Mu-yeong?”

“Full of poison.”

“Figures. He lost an arm overnight. Heh heh!”

Nam Woo-gyeong smirked in satisfaction.

He couldn’t forget the humiliation of being kidnapped by Eun Mu-yeong.

The Hao Clan’s misinformation campaign against the Nine Dragons Clan was still ongoing.

With no access to reliable intel, the Nine Dragons Clan was greatly restricted in their actions.

If not for the Wudang Sect’s opening ceremony, they would never have sent an envoy.

It had been a desperate move.

For them, the ceremony was the only way to break free from their current predicament. Strengthening ties with the Wudang Sect might allow them to escape their information blackout.

Nam Woo-gyeong took another sip and muttered,

“Though I wouldn’t get my hopes up about them getting any decent intel.”

The Nine Dragons Clan had hatched a vicious plan to kidnap the young master of Hao Clan and use him for their own gains.

The Hao Clan had no intention of forgiving them.

Even if they couldn’t crush them by force, they could make their lives miserable for a long time.

Glug glug!

Nam Woo-gyeong filled Lee Gwak’s cup to the brim.

“Gwak!”

“Be careful. The movements of the Wudang Sect and the other sects that have entered Sipyeon seem suspicious.”

“Does that have anything to do with me?”

“As I said earlier, you need to become more aware of your own value. From the perspective of sects just entering the Jianghu, you’re an incredibly tempting target. Just taking you down could earn them instant fame.”

“You think even the Wudang Sect would do that?”

“If I were them, I would. Why take a detour when there’s a straight path right in front of you? Do you understand what I’m saying now?”

“Yes!”

“Gwak! You must be careful. I’m not saying this out of baseless worry.”

“Understood.”

Lee Gwak nodded with a firm expression.

Nam Woo-gyeong wasn’t someone who said things without reason. And Lee Gwak had already begun to sense the change in the air around him.

“That’s enough lecturing. You get the point. Let’s just drink.”

“Yes!”

The atmosphere that had been tense for a moment softened.

The three of them drank while chatting casually.

Nam Woo-gyeong savored the taste of the alcohol.

“This stuff is amazing. How did I not know a place like this existed?”

“Unless you’re a local, you wouldn’t know about it.”

Lim Ji-mun replied with a mischievous smile.

“You found quite a place. I can’t believe this brat turned into such a drinker. Life really is full of surprises.”

Nam Woo-gyeong clicked his tongue and looked at Lim Ji-mun. But Lim Ji-mun paid no attention and continued to drink.

His face was already flushed red, but he showed no signs of stopping.

Lim Ji-mun had drunk far more than Lee Gwak and Nam Woo-gyeong combined.

And yet, except for his flushed face, he showed no signs of being drunk.

He was a heavy drinker in every sense of the word.

Nam Woo-gyeong stared at Lim Ji-mun with a look of disgust, but his thoughts were different.

‘He’s overshadowed by his sister, but he’s also a once-in-a-generation prodigy. And yet, he acknowledges Lee Gwak as his sect leader…’

Lim Ji-mun had been handling affairs with the Hao Clan in place of Lim So-bo. His way of dealing with matters was so astonishing that even the Hao Clan members who interacted with him were stunned.

Lim Ji-mun was a genius.

One of the traits of geniuses was that they rarely acknowledged someone superior to themselves. Unless the other person was truly exceptional, they would strive to surpass them. The fact that he willingly accepted Lee Gwak as his superior meant that Lee Gwak was beyond his reach.

Nam Woo-gyeong thought of Jinghae.

Since entering Sipyeon, that was the name he’d heard the most.

The hope of the Wudang Sect.

A genius who would restore the Wudang name to greatness.

A once-in-a-century prodigy.

There were countless other terms used to describe him.

It meant he carried immense expectations—and that he possessed the ability to match them.

He was, without a doubt, a genius among geniuses.

Nam Woo-gyeong was curious.

What would happen if Jinghae, the genius among geniuses, faced Lee Gwak, who had clawed his way up from the bottom to the peak of the Jianghu?

“It would be quite the sight.”
