The ship rocked violently, causing passengers on deck to lose their balance and tumble to the ground. Some of them had been caught in the explosion and were bruised.

“Ugh!”

“P-please, save me!”

In an instant, the deck turned into a living hell filled with screams of agony.

Lee Gwak’s expression hardened as he stepped onto the deck. His eyes swept over the people collapsed on the ground, moaning in pain. Some had severe injuries from the blast. The deck was already stained red with their blood.

He quickly moved toward the railing.

About a dozen small boats surrounded the Unmado River Boat.

Lee Gwak’s eyes narrowed.

Each of the small boats held about ten armed men. They kept their distance while surrounding the Unmado River Boat.

Then, they sent another empty boat drifting toward the Unmado River Boat. The pungent odor emanating from it made Lee Gwak realize what was happening.

“Thunder Bombs?”

The empty boat was loaded with explosives.

The earlier explosion had been caused by a similar boat colliding with the ship. Now, they were sending another.

The ship’s hull already had a massive hole, and water was gushing in relentlessly. The crew was desperately trying to plug the breach, but it was futile.

If another explosive-laden boat struck now, the Unmado River Boat would shatter.

Figuring out who the attackers were was important, but stopping the explosives from hitting the ship was even more urgent.

Lee Gwak stretched out his hand and fragments of the shattered boat flew into his grasp.

It was the Void Grasp technique.

He hurled the debris toward the approaching grenade boat.

BOOM!

The thunder bombs detonated upon impact, sending a massive water column towering into the sky.

The crew members shuddered with horror.

If Lee Gwak had not acted preemptively, many aboard the Unmado River Boat would have perished.

Once the immediate crisis was over, Lee Gwak turned his attention back to the attackers. They were clearly rattled, not expecting him to detonate the grenade so quickly.

But their hesitation was short-lived.

The enemy vessels began advancing toward the Unma River Boat.

As they drew closer, their appearance became clearer.

They wore shabby clothing and carried a variety of weapons, including hook swords, broadswords, spears, and axes.

Their attire was similar to that of ordinary river pirates, but their aura and the murderous glint in their eyes set them apart.

Every single one of them radiated the presence of a martial artist.

‘If they’re using Thunder Bombs, they must belong to a major faction.’

Thunder Bombs were rare and valuable.

Not only were they difficult to craft, but storing them was even harder.

Even if they had somehow acquired some, without proper maintenance, the gunpowder would quickly become damp and useless.

Because of this, Lee Gwak guessed they had no more bombs left. Now, they would have to engage directly.

He had to stop them before they boarded.

Whoosh!

Without hesitation, Lee Gwak leaped toward their boats.

“It’s him!”

“Attack!”

The pirates immediately turned their focus to him.

‘So I was the target after all.’

Lee Gwak’s eyes narrowed further.

Otherwise, the attack made no sense.

There was no treasure on board, nor were there any important dignitaries. That left only him as the likely target.

Crash!

Lee Gwak’s leaf-hand blade slammed into the pirates on the nearest boat.

Thwack!

His palm strike alone was a devastating weapon.

Those hit by it screamed as they were flung into the river.

In an instant, the first boat was cleared.

Lee Gwak immediately lunged toward the next. Seeing this, some pirates panicked and jumped into the water.

Ignoring them, Lee Gwak fixed his gaze on the martial artists aboard the second boat.

“Ugh! Attack!”

“He’s still human!”

They tried to muster their courage and charged.

Shwip-shwip!

Swish!

A long spear thrust toward Lee Gwak to keep him at bay, while those wielding short weapons like hook swords and axes closed in.

Their coordination was seamless—far beyond what ordinary pirates could manage.

Only those who had trained together for years could execute such flawless teamwork.

But their opponent was Lee Gwak.

Sssk!

The chilling sound of tearing air echoed, and the pirates collapsed, all badly wounded.

A dozen martial artists were incapacitated in an instant, without even a chance to scream.

Lee Gwak showed them no mercy.

These were the kind of people who would attack a ship full of innocent passengers without hesitation, they couldn’t be tolerated

Whizz!

At that moment, a barrage of hidden weapons flew toward him.

Seeing the two boats neutralized so quickly, the remaining pirates resorted to throwing poisoned needles, daggers, and darts.

But not a single one struck Lee Gwak.

With a swing of his blade, he deflected them all.

Slash!

Lee Gwak swung his blade at a nearby boat.

There was no visible sword energy or flashy technique.

He simply swung with speed, and the boat split in two and sank.

“My god! Did he just do that with speed alone?”

One of the attackers muttered unconsciously.

Lee Gwak’s gaze immediately turned toward the man’s boat.

It took a sharp eye to understand the skill he had just used. The fact that this man recognized it meant that he was highly skilled, too.

He was likely the leader.

Tap!

Without hesitation, Lee Gwak leapt toward the man’s boat.

Realizing his mistake too late, the man shouted in panic.

“Damn it! Don’t let him board!”

As Lee Gwak had guessed, the man was the pirates’ leader.

His true identity was Jo Bi-yeon, head of the Martial Dragon Squad.

He was originally a descendant of a renowned martial family of Jianghu. However, he was arrogant and a womanizer by nature. Though his family had covered up his scandals, he eventually crossed a line by targeting a woman he shouldn’t have.

Exiled from his clan, he wandered the land until he met Jin Woo-seon and became his subordinate.

Though lacking in morals, his martial prowess was undeniable—worthy of being called a peak expert.

Jin Woo-seon had ordered him to gather the remnants of the Green Heaven Society and unite the river pirates to build a force. Jo Bi-yeon had carried out his orders faithfully.

Then, just hours ago, he had received sudden orders:

The target was Lee Gwak.

Not to kill or injure him—just to delay him.

He had taken the task lightly.

With a stash of thunder bombs and a thirst for destruction, he had eagerly set out.

But his target was far more formidable than expected.

As a skilled martial artist, Jo Bi-yeon could sense that Lee Gwak’s level surpassed his own.

“Pull the boat back!”

He shouted at the oarsmen. But before they could even react, Lee Gwak landed on the deck.

“Die!”

“Yaaah!”

Jo Bi-yeon’s men attacked.

Clang!

The pirates on board attacked, but their strikes were effortlessly parried by Lee Gwak’s blade.

Clang!

Their weapons were knocked aside like toys.

Lee Gwak’s lead hand blade struck their chests.

“Guh!”

“Kgh!”

They were sent flying, screaming as they plummeted into the river.

Only Jo Bi-yeon remained on board.

Lee Gwak approached and asked,

“Why did you attack the ship I was on?”

“You think I’d tell you?”

Jo Bi-yeon bared his teeth and attacked. His sword gleamed with sword qi.

He knew he couldn’t win. But he couldn’t just stand by either.

Swiish!

His blade aimed straight for Lee Gwak’s throat.

Clink!

But it stopped dead before it could touch him.

Jo Bi-yeon’s eyes bulged.

Lee Gwak had caught the blade between his fingers.

“Empty-Hand Catch?!”

Jo Bi-yeon couldn’t believe it.

This technique was supposed to work only against ordinary strikes—not against a sword infused with sword qi!

His entire understanding of martial arts was being overturned.

Snap!

The next moment, his sword broke in half.

Then, using the broken blade, he stabbed Jo Bi-yeon in the shoulder.

“GAAAH!”

Jo Bi-yeon screamed as the steel pierced deep into his flesh.

Lee Gwak asked,

“Who ordered you to attack me?”

“Steward Jin.”

“Steward Jin? From the Heavenly Martial Manor?”

“Yes!”

“Why did he want to stop me?”

“I don’t know! I was just told to delay you! Argh!”

Tears streamed down Jo Bi-yeon’s face.

The malice he had shown moments ago was gone.

He had always enjoyed inflicting pain—but couldn’t endure it himself.

Now, he just wanted to die.

Lee Gwak continued,

“What’s his full name?”

“I don’t know. I only know him as Steward Jin.”

“Are you sure it was him?”

“Yes! He gave me funds to gather the remnants of the Green Heaven Society and the pirates!”

“Green Heaven Society?”

Lee Gwak’s brow twitched.

It was an organization created by Oh Cheol-geuk to oppose the Sky High Castle.

His thoughts were spinning.

‘Green Heaven Society, Oh Cheol-geuk… and Steward Jin…’

Something was connecting, but a central piece was still missing.

Then—

KUGUGU!

A tremendous roar erupted behind him.

Turning, Lee Gwak saw the Unmado River Boat Sinking.

Passengers and crew were leaping into the river in chaos.

The crew might swim to safety, but many passengers would drown.

He couldn’t let that happen.

Lee Gwak looked at Jo Bi-yeon.

“Your plan worked.”

“What?”

“You succeeded in delaying me.”

His voice carried anger.

He struck Jo Bi-yeon’s abdomen.

WHAM!

“GAAAH!”

Jo Bi-yeon was sent flying, his dantian shattered.

He would never practice martial arts again.

Unconscious, he sank into the river. Whether he would drown or resurface as a cripple no longer mattered to Lee Gwak.

He drove all the empty pirate boats toward the struggling passengers.

Splash!

The boats cut through the water, reaching them just in time.

Passengers and crew began climbing aboard.

Standing on a piece of driftwood, Lee Gwak watched the scene.

Fortunately, the crew who had boarded first began rowing to rescue the others.

It was a relief that the current here wasn’t too strong—had this happened in rapids, many would have died.

Lee Gwak let out a quiet sigh of relief and propelled himself toward the riverbank.

He soared nearly thirty meters before lightly landing on the head of a struggling pirate and using it as a stepping stone to gain momentum.

In an instant, he reached dry land.

But his expression remained grim.

Steward Jin had succeeded in delaying him.

With the Unmado River Boat destroyed, he had no choice but to waste more time reaching his destination.

‘If anything happens to Brother Woo-gyeong I swear I will never forgive you.’

The thought of Steward Jin flashed through his mind as he unleashed his qigong and sped away.
