“I must be hearing things now that I’m about to die.”

Seo Jong-myeong struggled to open his eyes.

Though the shadow of death loomed thick over him, his gaze remained sharp and unyielding. Even in the face of death, his spirit refused to break.

Then—

Screech!

With a sharp metallic screech, the heavy iron door that had been confining him swung open. Lee Gwak had cut through the massive lock with his blade.

As Lee Gwak and Lee Soo-ah stepped inside, Seo Jong-myeong blinked in disbelief. He thought he was hallucinating. That’s why he didn’t say anything, though honestly, he didn’t have the strength to speak anyway.

“Brother!”

“Uncle!”

The two of them rushed forward at once.

Feeling the warmth of their touch, Seo Jong-myeong realized this wasn’t a dream.

“Heh… You came…”

“Of course we came. How could I leave our commander imprisoned?”

“You’re the leader now. I’m just an old man…”

Even in this dire situation, Seo Jong-myeong managed a weak joke.

Lee Gwak supported him and said,

“You must still have some life left in you if you can crack jokes.”

“How… did you find me?”

“Someone told us you were being held here. It wasn’t easy, but we tracked you down.”

As he spoke, Lee Gwak searched his pouch and took out a life-saving pill and golden wound ointment.

First, he forced the pill into Seo Jong-myeong’s mouth. Then, he examined his wounds.

Many of the injuries had already necrotized, teeming with maggots, but Lee Gwak didn’t flinch. Without hesitation, he scraped off the rotting flesh and maggots in one go.

“Argh!”

Seo Jong-myeong writhed in agony, but Lee Gwak was unfazed and applied the Golden Wound Medicine liberally.

Both the pill and the ointment had been given to him by the divine physician, so he knew they were effective.

After taking the pill, Seo Jong-myeong’s complexion visibly improved. However, Lee Gwak couldn’t relax yet. He needed proper treatment in a safe place as soon as possible.

“Brother, climb onto my back.”

“I can stand on my own.”

Seo Jong-myeong refused to be carried.

He’d rather die than show weakness in the den of the Celestial Demon Troupe.

“Lean on my shoulder.”

Lee Soo-ah quickly offered her shoulder instead.

“Th…ank you.”

Fortunately, this time, Seo Jong-myeong didn’t refuse.

Gripping her shoulder, he took slow, painful steps.

Every movement sent waves of excruciating pain through his body. Even breathing was laborious, and walking was even more torturous.

Yet, Seo Jong-myeong didn’t let out a single scream.

It was a combination of superhuman endurance and unbreakable pride.

Even Lee Gwak was left in awe.

“Ah, Gwak-ah!”

Suddenly, Seo Jong-myeong called out to him.

“Yes, Hyung-nim.”

“I hate to impose, but since things have come to this, I have one more request.”

“Speak.”

“Find my sword. I believe the prison master has it.”

Despite being on the brink of death, Seo Jong-myeong asked for his sword. There was a reason.

His beloved sword, Bisa, was a sacred relic of the Diancang Sect.

Like the Kongtong Sect, the Diancang Sect had been annihilated by the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Bisa was the last remaining legacy of the Diancang Sect, a treasure Seo Jong-myeong valued more than his own life.

Having accompanied Seo Jong-myeong to retrieve it in the past, Lee Gwak understood its significance better than anyone.

By all accounts, it was an unreasonable request.

No one would blame him for refusing.

Even Seo Jong-myeong wouldn’t resent him if he declined.

Lee Gwak’s gaze shifted to Lee Soo-ah.

“Soo-ah.”

“Yeah?”

“There’s going to be a commotion. Use that chance to escape first.”

“Got it.”

“I’ll be back soon. Wait outside, brother Jin Hwi is probably there.”

“Understood. And… thank you.”

Lee Gwak gave Seo Jong-myeong a slight nod before stepping out of the prison first.

To Seo Jong-myeong, Bisa meant more than his life.

For the last descendant of the fallen Diancang Sect, the sword was his final pillar of strength. Without it, he would collapse.

So, to save Seo Jong-myeong, Bisa had to be retrieved.

For Lee Gwak, this wasn’t a choice, it was a necessity.

He moved forward without hesitation.

Then, in the distance, he spotted a group of Celestial Demon Troupe warriors approaching.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, Lee Gwak burst forward using his Revolving Steps.

“What the—?!”

“Ugh!”

Before they could draw their weapons, his blade slashed through the air.

“Guh!”

“Ack!”

The bodies of the warriors collapsed like sandcastles under his blade, and the remaining warrior found Star Soul pressed against his throat.

The icy cold steel against his neck paralyzed him, he couldn’t even speak.

Lee Gwak tightened his grip.

“Kgh—!”

The warrior’s eyes bulged as the cold sensation pierced his neck.

Lee Gwak asked,

“Where is the Prison Master’s quarters?”

“Exit here, turn left, go to the next cave, and enter the largest room. Please spare my life—”

Thud!

Lee Gwak’s fingers had struck the warrior’s pressure point, silencing him instantly.

Leaving the fallen warriors behind, Lee Gwak headed in the direction he’d been given.

The prison master of this place, Blood Tower Giant Demon Won Mu-ak, resided in the most heavily guarded section of the prison. Sneaking in unnoticed was impossible.

Lee Gwak silently took down or avoided several guards, but eventually, he was spotted.

“Who goes there?!”

“Stop right there!”

A flood of warriors swarmed in, surrounding him.

Their murderous aura was thick and menacing.

Just as they glared at him with bloodthirsty eyes—

“You’ve got some nerve walking into the Endless Prison! You must have a death wish.”

A giant of a man approached with a booming voice. It was Won Mu-ak,prison master of the endless prison.

His cold eyes glared down at Lee Gwak, radiating an overwhelming sense of pressure.

Won Mu-ak stopped in front of him and demanded,

“What’s your connection to the rat that snuck in earlier? Did you have something to do with Jin Ryeong’s disappearance?”

Despite his brutish appearance, Won Mu-ak’e possessed sharp intuition.

He had already linked Jin Ryeong’s failure to return with Lee Gwak’s presence.

“If you’ve got any honor, state your name.”

A terrifying killing intent emanated from him.

Lee Gwak said nothing. His eyes were fixed on Won Mu-ak’s waist.

He finally found what he was looking for:

Bisa.

Won Mu-ak didn’t use weapons; his fists were deadly enough. However, he carried Bisa purely for its value as a prized artifact.

Lee Gwak spoke.

“If you hand over that sword, I’ll leave peacefully.”

“Quietly? Are you mocking me, brat? You need to have your mouth smashed in. Don’t just stand there, get him!”

At Won Mu-ak’s roar, the warriors tightened their encirclement.

Lee Gwak sighed softly.

He never expected to retrieve Bisa peacefully.

Nor did he intend to.

He needed to draw their attention to ensure Seo Jong-myeong and Lee Soo-ah escaped safely.

Shing!

Lee Gwak drew his blade.

The warriors hesitated.

Something about the way he held the blade made their instincts scream.

They were all experts, and this was their home turf, they had numbers and familiarity. Still, unease crept up their spines.

It was pure instinct.

Their instincts told them that the man before them was no ordinary opponent.

Under normal circumstances, or if they were alone, they would have fled without hesitation. But Won Mu-ak’e’s presence and overwhelming numbers dulled their fear.

“Attack!”

“Subdue him!”

The warriors charged.

Lee Gwak moved.

Sshhk!

Star Soul split the darkness.

“Keuk!”

One warrior fell, blood gushing from his throat.

The space was tight.

Lee Gwak knew that being surrounded would mean certain death, so he attacked with deadly force from the start.

Slice! Slash!

His blade continuously cut through the darkness.

Every time a warrior rushed at him, he cut them down, spilling their blood.

His one-strike, one-kill strategy froze the others in their tracks.

Then, a woman stepped into the scene.

It was Gu Mun-hye, the saintess of the Celestial Demon Troupe.

“What’s happening? Oh—!”

She stopped mid-sentence, her eyes wide.

She recognized Lee Gwak instantly.

“That man?!”

“You know him?”

Won Mu-ak asked with narrowed eyes.

“He’s Lee Gwak.”

“Lee Gwak? The Sura blade?”

“That’s what they call him in the Jianghu.”

“Hmph.”

Won Mu-ak grunted.

Though he had semi-retired from the sect, he wasn’t blind or deaf.

One of the most frequent rumors he’d heard during his isolation was about Lee Gwak.

“Why is the Sura Blade here?”

“Probably because of the Siege Fortress Lord.”

“Siege Fortress Lord? That Seo Jong-myeong?”

“Yes. I heard they’ve been close since their days in the Jade Heaven Alliance Alliance.”

“How annoying.

Won Mu-ak clicked his tongue, but his eyes showed no fear.

Though he was not widely known, Won Mu-ak was one of Celestial Demon Troupe’s top martial artists. He wasn’t about to back down because of some overhyped youth.

“Let’s see how tough you really are.”

“Please be careful—”

“Enough! This is my domain.”

“Even the Sect Leader considers him a worthy opponent. You mustn’t act recklessly.”

“Hmph! That makes this even more fun.”

Won Mu-ak stepped forward.

Gu Mun-hye watched him with concern.

Of all people, it had to be him.

The Celestial Demon Troupe had built this secret prison for a reason.

And now, of all people, Lee Gwak had discovered it.

‘Getting involved with him at a time like this… This is bad.’

Her thoughts raced chaotically—

Just as Won Mu-ak threw a punch at Lee Gwak.

“Die!”

Whoosh!

A condensed surge of qi hurtled toward Lee Gwak.

Instead of dodging, Lee Gwak swung his blade.

Kwaang!

A deafening explosion rocked the cave as both men were forced back.

The confined space concentrated the impact, but the two were fine.

The same couldn’t be said for the warriors caught between them.

“Guhk!”

“Keuk!”

Screams filled the air as bodies slammed into the walls.

Won Mu-ak’e ignored them, his eyes locked on Lee Gwak.

“Die!”

Another fist qi shot forward.

Blood Shattering Fist.

BOOM!

A red flash lit up the cave, blinding everyone.

Even Gu Mun-hye flinched and shut her eyes.

Slash!

A chilling sound cut through the air.

“Ugh…!”

A stifled groan sounded, and the red light faded.

Gu Mun-hye slowly opened her eyes.

What she saw made her blood run cold.

Won Mu-ak stood there, clutching his right shoulder with his left hand.

Blood gushed between his fingers.

His right arm… was gone.

Lee Gwak had cleanly severed it at the shoulder, and the dismembered limb lay on the ground.

“You…!”

Won Mu-ak’s face twisted into a demonic expression.

In that instant, Lee Gwak closed the distance like the wind and appeared right in front of him.

Crack!

The edge of his left hand, not holding the blade slammed into Won Mu-ak’s chest. It was his left hand blade.

Won Mu-ak’e was sent crashing into the cave wall.

The impact dislodged bisa from his waist, sending it clattering to the ground.

Lee Gwak carefully picked up the sword.

“Huu…”
