Manhwa: Chapter 51-52

The person who called out to Dan Li-yeon and Muk Seon-wol was a handsome martial artist who appeared to be in his early twenties.

With a stature rivaling Lee Gwaks, he wore a splendid robe embroidered with gold threads, and his waist was adorned with a particularly eye-catching ancient yet ornate sword scabbard.

As he approached the two women, he spoke,

Could it be that the two of you are dining at such a humble street stall?

Young Master Yeom!

We all thought you two were in a hurry to get out of the meeting because you had some urgent business to attend to, but I never expected that you would have eaten at a place like this.

The man, referred to as Young Master Yeom, smiled broadly as he surveyed the stall and its surroundings. However, despite his smiling face, his eyes did not carry the same warmth.

The mans name was Yeom Ki-ho. He was the senior disciple of the Seven Absolute Sect, a renowned martial arts school in the Jianghu. Although not part of the Ten Young Heavens, rumors suggested that his martial prowess was no less than theirs.

The Seven Absolute Sect was a prestigious martial school, inflating Yeom Ki-hos pride to sky-high levels. He was often criticized for his arrogance, but he paid little heed to such opinions.

His heart had been pounding with anticipation when hed been told that he would be coming to the Jade Heaven Alliance for the Jianghu Grand Conference. It was an excellent opportunity to meet the renowned female warriors whose names echoed throughout Jianghu.

The shock he felt upon seeing Muk Seon-wol and Dan Li-yeon in person was indescribable. This was because they were more beautiful and mysterious than any women he had ever seen.

Yeom Ki-ho and other renowned martial artists had tried to get closer to the two women, but unfortunately, they were met with cold and distant attitudes.

There was an invisible wall between them, a wall so high and thick that it seemed almost impossible for him to penetrate it, and so he was disappointed when he happened to see them again.

There seemed to be an invisible wall around them, too high and thick for Yeom Ki-ho to penetrate. So, when he coincidentally met them again, he was overjoyed.

His gaze then settled on Lee Gwak, who was standing beside the two women.

And who might you be?

I am Lee Gwak, an Outer Hall squad leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

His eyes narrowed slightly.

Lee Gwak could sense the faint hostility in Yeom Ki-hos eyes. He could tell just by looking at him that he held an interest in Muk Seon-wol and Dan Li-yeon.

Lee Gwak genuinely didnt want to be caught up in any trouble due to drawing Yeom Ki-hos ire.

I just happened to share a table with them. I need to go for my duty now. Excuse me

Just as Lee Gwak was about to leave after bowing to Yeom Ki-ho and the two women

Wait a moment!

Yeom Ki-ho called out to stop him.

As Lee Gwak looked back, puzzled, Yeom Ki-ho approached and patted him on the shoulder.

I just wanted to wish you well on your way. Take care. Hehe!

At that moment, Lee Gwaks expression subtly changed.

Yeom Ki-ho, still smiling, turned back to Muk Seon-wol and Dan Li-yeon.

Since weve met again, it must be fate. How about we continue the conversation we couldnt have earlier?

Young Master Yeom!

Suddenly, Muk Seon-wols voice turned icy cold, causing a look of confusion to appear on Yeom Ki-hos face.

Why Whats wrong, Lady Muk?

What are you doing?

What do you mean?

You just used an Internal Destruction Technique 2 on Squad Leader Lee.

Taken aback by Muk Seon-wols accusation, Yeom Ki-ho stuttered in shock. He hadnt expected her to notice that he had subtly applied his Internal Destruction Technique while patting Lee Gwaks shoulder.

There was no other reason. Yeom Ki-ho just found it simply infuriating to see a mere Outer Hall martial artist sitting at the same table with the women he was interested in.

Still, out of a sense of mercy, he had restrained himself to using only about twenty percent of his power. He calibrated his force just enough to cause internal injury that would trouble Lee Gwak for a few months. Otherwise, had he used his full strength, Lee Gwak would have died instantly on the spot.

The problem was that Muk Seon-wol had detected his covert use of the technique.

Why did you do that?

A cold aura emanated from Muk Seon-wol.

Typically, Muk Seon-wol carried an elegant and serene demeanor. However, once she became angry, she unleashed a storm-like coldness.

Seeing such a reaction from Muk Seon-wol, Dan Li-yeon clicked her tongue.

She too had realized early on that Yeom Ki-ho had employed a covert technique. Though Yeom Ki-ho might have thought he was being discreet, deceiving those who had reached far higher realms like them was practically impossible.

Dan Li-yeon knew Muk Seon-wol to be courteous and noble, always maintaining a dignified distance from others affairs. But she also had a resolute nature that couldnt tolerate injustice.

To Muk Seon-wol, Lee Gwak appeared as a vulnerable individual in need of protection. It was natural for her to be outraged by Yeom Ki-hos underhanded attack on such a person.

The aura emanating from Muk Seon-wol swelled rapidly like a snowball.

Lady Muk, it seems theres a misunderstanding. Please calm down.

Why dont you try your Internal Destruction Technique on me?

Faced with Muk Seon-wols relentless pressure, Yeom Ki-hos expression hardened.

Dont do this, Lady Muk. If you continue, I wont be able to hold back any longer.

What if you cant hold back?

Are you always so bold against those weaker than yourself?

At that moment, Yeom Ki-ho felt the last strand of his rationality snap. He could no longer contain his anger and unleashed his attack.

A powerful force, like a raging storm, surged towards Muk Seon-wol. It was his perfected Rock Shattering Palm, 2 executed at its peak.

Even as the massive force of Yeom Ki-hos Rock Shattering Palm, capable of pulverizing giant rocks, surged towards her, Muk Seon-wol didnt even blink.

She moved only when Yeom Ki-hos force was nearly upon her.

Muk Seon-wol vanished from Yeom Ki-hos sight.

Confused, Yeom Ki-ho turned to locate Muk Seon-wol, but at that moment

With a loud crash, Yeom Ki-ho was sent flying sideways.

Muk Seon-wol, who had disappeared from his view, reappeared beside him and struck him with her fist. Although Yeom Ki-ho managed to block her attack with his elbow, he couldnt fully absorb the impact and was thrown off.

A trickle of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth. Even as his internal organs shook and his energy was disrupted, he prepared to counterattack, but Muk Seon-wol was faster.

The whip coiled her waist stretched out like a venomous snake and wrapped around Yeom Ki-hos body. It was a substitute for the Serpentine Waist Sword she usually carried.

Yeom Ki-ho quickly tried to summon his inner strength to break free from the whip, but it was in vain. The whip didnt budge, it was unyielding like iron chains. Rather, it even tightened around his body with tremendous pressure.

Muk Seon-wols pure white palms poured down like rain on Yeom Ki-hos immobilized body.

Puff, puff, puff!

After being struck a dozen times in the blink of an eye, Yeom Ki-ho screamed and rolled on the ground.

Despite being touted outside as having near-Ten Young Heavens-level prowess, in reality, his skills were far too weak to compare to Muk Seon-wols.

Muk Seon-wol retracted her whip with a snort, a glint of disdain appearing on her face for the first time.

Yeom Ki-ho, with such limited skill, had been so insolent and intrusive.

Feeling a release from the pressure that had been weighing on her, Muk Seon-wol opened her mouth.

Young Master Yeom, I think you should put more effort into your own training, instead of using underhanded tactics against the weak. If I caught you in such an act again, I wont be so lenient next time.

Grasping his chest, Yeom Ki-ho was unable to utter any excuses. His face was filled with shame.

He hadnt expected to be so effortlessly subdued without even being able to launch a proper attack. If this incident became known in the martial world, he would never be able to hold his head high again.

Ill not let these bitches off easily. Ill have my revenge.

Determined to avenge his humiliation, Yeom Ki-ho managed to get up and stagger away. After watching him stagger away for a moment, Muk Seon-wol then turned to Lee Gwak with a worried expression.

Are you alright?

Yes, Im fine.

Im sorry, I didnt mean to get you involved in this.

Muk Seon-wol genuinely looked apologetic.

If it hadnt been for her and Dan Li-yeons presence, Lee Gwak would never have gotten caught up in the situation and been subjected to the Internal Destruction Technique.

Lee Gwak was truly unharmed. Although Yeom Ki-hos Internal Destruction Technique was extremely dangerous, it had caused no harm to Lee Gwak.

This was because the moment the technique penetrated his body, the giant snake within him had immediately devoured it.

But for Muk Seon-wol, who was unaware of this fact, she couldnt help but worry.

Normally, anyone who fell victim to the Internal Destruction Technique was bound to die in great pain from internal injuries. Even if they were lucky enough to survive, they would have to spend more than a year immobilized and treated to regain basic functions.

It was then that Dan Li-yeon intervened.

Hell be fine.

What do you mean?

Because Ill give him this.

She pulled out a black wooden box from her belongings. A fragrant scent wafted from the boxs opening.

Could that be?

Yes, its a Vital Essence Pill. 4 With this, any internal damage caused by the Internal Destruction Technique can be completely healed.

The Vital Essence Pill was a secret elixir of the Jade Heaven Alliance, renowned for its remarkable efficacy in enhancing internal energy and healing internal injuries.

Is it alright for you to give him something so precious?

I dont need it anyway. Since hes gone through all this trouble for us, its the least I can do. Besides, I owe him to some extent.

You owe him?

Muk Seon-wol looked puzzled, but Dan Li-yeon chose not to elaborate further.

Whenever she happened to see Lee Gwak, her heart always felt unusually heavy. At first, she wasnt sure why, but after thinking about it for a while, it became clear.

Though it wasnt intentional, the fact remained that her senior brother, Yong Cheon-myeong, had taken Lee Gwaks lover away. And she herself had carelessly advised the heartbroken Lee Gwak not to act rashly.

At the time, she hadnt thought much of it, but it seemed to have deeply affected her in hindsight.

Even though the Vital Essence Pill was a rare treasure in the martial world, it wasnt particularly necessary for Dan Li-yeon. The time for enhancing her internal strength with such elixirs had long passed. So, thinking of it as repaying a debt of the heart, she gladly handed the Vital Essence Pill to Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak waved his hands in refusal.

I cant accept such a precious item.

Just take it and use it. Otherwise, youll suffer for a long time.

Yeah. Since its not of much use to Li-yeon anyway, take it. If you dont use it, your vital energy will be severely damaged, and you wont be able to lead a normal life.

When Muk Seon-wol also insisted, Lee Gwak could no longer refuse. Moreover, both women looked genuinely apologetic.

Then, I will gratefully accept it.

In the end, Lee Gwak had no choice but to accept the Vital Essence Pill.

Dont save it for later and use it tonight.

Understood.

You promise?

Only after hearing Lee Gwaks firm response did Dan Li-yeon smile contentedly. She wanted to compensate the old lady who ran the stall for any trouble caused during Muk Seon-wols fight with Yeom Ki-ho, as her stall had been damaged in the process.

But the old lady adamantly refused compensation.

Im fine, really.

Although she was merely selling hotpot at a street stall, the old woman had discernment.

She had realized that Muk Seon-wol and Dan Li-yeon held very high statuses within the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Thus, she tried to refuse their compensation. However, Dan Li-yeon forcefully placed money in the old womans hand.

Please accept it. Consider it as payment in advance for the food. So, when we come next time, you have to serve us delicious hotpot, okay?

Still, its too much.

Haha! Ill be coming again and again. This year and the next as well, so I hope you can do business here for a long time.

Alright, miss. I promise to keep my business going for a long time and serve you delicious hotpot.

Finally, the old woman replied, wiping a tear from her eye.

Well done.

Muk Seon-wol smiled and nodded at Dan Li-yeon, clearly pleased with her handling of the situation.

Then well be leaving now. Take care of yourself, Squad Leader Lee.

See you later.

After bidding farewell to Lee Gwak, the two women entered the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Lee Gwako watched them walk away before turning his attention to the Vital Essence Pill in his hand.

Just as the Vital Essence Pill was of little use to Dan Li-yeon, it was of no use to Lee Gwak as well. The time for Lee Gwak to use such elixirs to improve his internal cultivation has also long passed.

After opening the sixth gate and acquiring the Minds Eye, Lee Gwaks internal strength had increased exponentially.

While he did not know how much the Vital Essence Pill could enhance his internal strength, it would likely be as inconsequential as a small stream joining a raging and vast river. Nonetheless, having made a promise, he intended to consume it eventually.

Lee Gwak tucked the Vital Essence Pill into his robe and murmured to himself.

The course of fate is truly beyond prediction and measurement
