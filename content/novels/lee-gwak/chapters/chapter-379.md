“Hmm!”

Po Cheon-wol and the others’ expressions changed.

The internal energy imbued in the voice had resonated through their meridians.

Bang!

“Who goes there?”

“Who goes there?”

Po Cheon-wol slammed his palm on the table and rose to his feet.

The sound of his palm hitting the table canceled out the lingering echo of the voice from outside.

The four of them stepped out of the inn together.

The moment Namging Jing-geom took in the scene outside, his gaze turned sharp.

A young Taoist was standing under a large tree in front of the inn.

He was wearing a Taoist cap on his head and a light blue Taoist robe with a Yin-Yang symbol embroidered on the back.

He looked like a regular Taoist to anyone’s eyes. Yet none of those present considered him ordinary.

The internal energy carried in his voice was far from normal.

Namging Jing-geom focused his gaze and scanned the Taoist’s face in detail.

He appeared to be just over thirty. His eyes were cold and clear as a still lake, and his firmly closed lips radiated stubborn resolve.

Most of all, he had a calm, serene air about him.

No matter how exceptional a martial artist might be, most would instinctively shrink back upon facing three of the “Seven Supreme Leaders”. But the Taoist was looking at them with an indifferent gaze.

No matter how you looked at him, he wasn’t an ordinary Taoist.

“Who are you?”

“Namu Amitabha! My Taoist name is Jinghae.”

“Jinghae?”

Namgoong Jin-geom tilted his head at the Taoist’s calm reply.

He had never heard that Taoist name before.

Despite being in front of three absolute masters of the Jianghu, Jinghae did not show the slightest hesitation.

As far as he knew, there had never been a young Taoist anywhere near this level in the last hundred years, at least not since the Ten Sects ruled the Jianghu.

‘A hundred years, huh? What about a hundred years ago?’

Are you from Wudang or Mount Hua?”

“As expected of you, Master Namgung. Correct. I am from Wudang.”

“Wudang…”

“Mmm.”

Hearing the name Wudang made Namgung Jing-geom and the others let out a low murmur.

No matter how mighty they were, it was impossible to remain calm upon hearing that name.

The Wudang Sect.

A legendary sect once called the pinnacle of the Jianhu alongside Shaolin.

Even though they had fallen to the Demonic Cult’s invasion a century ago, and had chosen to seclude themselves. Their name still carried the weight of Mount Tai, over the centuries, the Wudang Sect had gradually faded from public memory.

They were simply lumped together with the Shaolin Temple under the collective name Hidden Sects.

As a result, it had been a long time since anyone had actually heard the name ‘Wudang Sect’.

“Wudang… What is your status within the Wudang Sect?”

“I hold no specific position. Please, just call me Jinghae.”

“Alright, Jinghae. What brings you here? Surely you didn’t just stop by.”

“Yes. I came here today because I knew that you would meet here.”

“You knew to come here?”

“That’s correct.”

“Why?”

“Of course, because I wanted to talk with you all.”

“Let me ask something first.”

Namgung Jin-geom interrupted Jinghae.

Jinghae looked at him and nodded.

“Speak.”

“Your presence here, does it mean that the Wudang Sect is preparing to return to the world?”

“That’s correct.”

“But I thought Wudang had shut its doors completely.”

“There is nothing eternal in this world.”

“One more question.”

“…”

“What about Shaolin and Mount Hua? Surely they aren’t planning to break their seclusion as well?”

“That is not something I can answer.”

Jinghae evaded the question.

However, Namgung Jin-geom was certain.

If Wudang is making a move, there’s no way Shaolin and Mount Hua will just stand by.

He bit his lip hard.

The world was in turmoil.

With the Jade Heaven Alliance plunging the land into chaos, the re-emergence of Wudang and the other Five Great Sects would only drag the world into greater chaos.

“Why?”

“What do you mean?”

“Why break the seclusion at this time?”

“Because the world is in chaos. Because the people are suffering due to your actions.”

“What nonsense is that? How are the people suffering because of us?”

“Wudang and Shaolin willingly chose seclusion because we trusted you. We believed that you would bring stability to the world, and so we closed our gates and withdrew from worldly affairs.”

“Wait! You speak as if Wudang and Shaolin secluded themselves for some grand moral reason. In truth, you were nearly annihilated by the Demonic Cult and had no choice but to retreat!”

“Of course, that was also part of the reason.”

Even though it was a point that could have stung, Jinghae answered calmly.

His composure irritated Po Cheon-wol.

“You! Speak plainly. What is your purpose in seeking us out?”

“I told you—I came to speak with the three of you.”

“Speak? You dare claim to speak with us as equals?”

Po Cheon-wol’s voice carried clear anger.

No matter how great Wudang’s reputation had once been, it was a thing of the past.

The current martial world was ruled by the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Ten Great Sects.

No sect, not even the legendary Five Great Sects that had dominated the Jianghu a century ago, could dare challenge their supremacy.

While Namgung Jin-geom and Po Cheon-wol bristled, Eun Won-ho’s expression remained perfectly calm.

He was a merchant to his bones—more concerned with profit than pride.

His mind raced.

‘This isn’t bad.’

He quickly reached a conclusion and studied Jinghae.

Though Po Cheon-wol and Namgung Jin-geom were amping up their aura, Jinghae didn’t even blink.

He was withstanding the aura of two supreme masters alone.

Eun Won-ho inwardly marveled at this.

He didn’t know Jinghae’s exact standing in Wudang, but it was clear he was no lightweight.

At that moment, Jinghae’s composed voice rang out again.

“As an individual, I may not be qualified to speak on equal terms with you. But Jinghae of the Wudang Sect is different. I believe that entitles me to a conversation.”

“How dare you?!”

CRACK!

In an instant, Po Cheon-wol sent a fist qi towards Jinghae.

“Senior!”

Namgung Jin-geom tried to stop him, but it was too late.

Po Cheon-wol’s fist was already inches from Jinghae’s face.

SWOOSH!

The sword on Jinghae’s back unsheathed itself as if alive, spinning midair before cleanly slicing through Po Cheon-wol’s fist qi.

SHING!

“Qi-Guided Sword?!”

Namgung Jin-geom’s eyes darkened as he recognized the level of swordsmanship Jinghae had just displayed.

Lee Gwak and Oh Jung-gyeong stood facing each other.

“It’s time we part ways.”

“Thanks to you, the journey was smooth. I appreciate it!”

“Between friends, there’s no need for thanks…”

Oh Jung-gyeong chuckled and extended his hand. Lee Gwak grasped it firmly.

Though they hadn’t known each other long, they had forged a deep trust.

They regretted parting so soon, but each had his own business to attend to, so they accepted their farewell with good grace.

Lee Gwak spoke.

“I will bring my family to Jeongong Escort Agency one day.”

“If you come, I’ll lock the agency’s gates for three days and throw a grand feast.”

“Looking forward to it.”

“I do too. May you accomplish your great undertaking quickly, so that day will come all the sooner.”

“I’ll do my best.”

“Well, I’ll be on my way then.”

Oh Jung-gyeong waved and rejoined his escorts.

As he regrouped with his men, they immediately set into motion.

Lee Gwak stood still and watched them disappear into the distance.

The Jeongong Escort Agency’s destination was Kaifeng, while Lee Gwak’s group was headed for Lu’An.

Thanks to the escort agency, their journey had been smooth. Cheon-Wol had nearly fully recovered —though the mental scars remained, his body was back in peak condition.

The one thing that had changed was Cheon-Wol’s gaze.

His eyes were colder than ever before.

His attitude toward Lee Gwak was the same as always, but the underlying aura around him had undeniably shifted.

If not for Seok Yi-cheon’s devoted care, things might have been far worse.

“Brother, let’s go now.”

Bang Ye-in approached Lee Gwak.

“Right. Let’s move.”

They were already behind schedule because of taking care of Cheonwol.

Their destination was not far, and Bang Ye-in was feeling increasingly anxious.

Though she had wandered the world as a free spirit, the Bang Family Inn was her heart’s resting place.

The thought of seeing her parents after so long made her pulse quicken.

As Bang Ye-in smiled, Cheol Gwang-woo also broke into a grin.

“You’re such a homebody.”

“Huh?”

“Never mind. Let’s go!”

Lee Gwak smirked as he walked ahead.

Since parting with the escort agency, they had to travel on foot. But no one complained.

In fact, they were relieved to be free of the cramped carriage.

Bang Ye-in clung to Cheol Gwang-woo’s side, chattering away, while Seok Yi-cheon endlessly engaged Cheon-Wol in conversation.

Lee Gwak observed them all with quiet amusement as they walked.

After two days of travel, their destination finally came into view.

They had arrived in Lu’An.

“Wow!”

Bang Ye-in burst into a radiant smile.

The familiar scenery lifted her spirits instantly.

Her steps quickened.

A small building came into sight by the river, surrounded by plum blossoms.

It was the Bang Family Inn.

“Dad!”

Bang Ye-in called out as she ran forward.

Cheol Gwang-woo followed with heavy footsteps.

Lee Gwak, trailing behind them, furrowed his brow deeply.

“Brother?”

Cheon-Wol cautiously called out to him.

His expression was also slightly tense.

“What’s wrong?”

Seok Yi-cheon, sensing something amiss, asked carefully.

Lee Gwak answered grimly.

“It seems we had visitors.”

“Visitors?”

Signs of damage were visible outside the inn—broken windows and clear marks of a fierce battle in the front yard.

“Hmm…”

Seok Yi-cheon finally noticed the unusual atmosphere and let out a low hum.

Lee Gwak stepped past him and approached the inn.

“Dad!”

Bang Ye-in, too, sensed something was off and raised her voice.

Just then—

“What’s all this noise? If you’re home, come in quietly—why the commotion?”

A middle-aged man stepped out, wiping his wet hands with a towel.

It was Bang Ju-gwang, the owner of the Bang Family Inn.

Bang Ye-in’s eyes widened at the sight of him.

“Dad! You’re okay?”

“Why wouldn’t I be? Did you expect me to be hurt?”

“Ugh! You know what I mean! Are you hurt anywhere?”

“Why would I be hurt?”

“But the inn is like this…”

Bang Ye-in trailed off, glancing at the damaged inn. Bang Ju-gwang huffed.

“There was a bit of a ruckus, but everything’s fine now. It’s not the first time—no need to fuss. More importantly, who are these people?”

Bang Ju-gwang stared intently at Lee Gwak’s group. Lee Gwak stepped forward and clasped his fists respectfully.

“Pleasure to meet you. I’m Lee Gwak.”

“Lee Gwak? The sura Blade?”

“That’s what some in the Jianghu call me.”

“Hah! First yesterday, and now today—nothing but big shots visiting.”

“It seems someone else came yesterday?”

“We’ll talk about that later. For now, come inside. The outside’s a mess, but the interior’s fine.”

“Understood.”

Bang Ju-gwang led them into the inn.

True to his word, the inside was untouched.

“Whew!”

Bang Ye-in finally let out a sigh of relief.

Bang Ju-gwang turned to her.

“What are you doing? We have guests—shouldn’t you bring out some food?”

“I just got back!”

“And?”

“Tch! Fine.”

Bang Ye-in slumped her shoulders and headed to the kitchen. Cheol Gwang-woo, looking like a lost puppy, hesitated, glancing at Bang Ju-gwang for cues.

Bang Ju-gwang huffed at him.

“What are you standing around for? Go help her.”

“Yes!”

Cheol Gwang-woo brightened and rushed after her.

Watching his retreating figure, Bang Ju-gwang muttered under his breath.

“Tsk tsk. A guy built like a bear, yet so hesitant…”

Despite his grumbling, a faint smile tugged at his lips.
