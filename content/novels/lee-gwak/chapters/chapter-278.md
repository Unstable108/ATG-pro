“Ugh!”

Go Jeon-ok gasped in Lee Gwak’s arms. Each time he did, dark red blood gushed out.

Go Jeon-ok’s chin and chest were stained crimson with fresh blood.

His limbs felt weak. No, he couldn’t feel them at all. Instead, an unbearable chill consumed him.

Shivering, Go Jeon-ok tried to look for Lee Gwak.

His vision was already blurring, the world fading.

“Gwak! Are you there?”

“Yes, I’m here.”

“You cruel bastard.”

“…”

“Even so… I don’t regret it. I… burned everything I had.”

Go Jeon-ok forced a smile, even though he barely had the strength to move his facial muscles.

He had smiled and cried to suit others’ moods.

So at least when he died, he wanted to be true to his own feelings.

“I don’t… regret… anything…”

Go Jeon-ok’s voice faded and then abruptly stopped.

He had died.

“Jeon-ok!”

Lee Gwak looked sorrowfully at Go Jeon-ok, who lay in his arms.

Despite the paths that had divided them, they were once bound by friendship. It saddened him that he had ended the life of someone with whom he had shared his youth.

As if to prove his last words that he didn’t regret it, Go Jeon-ok had a devilish expression even in death.

“Do you really not regret it?”

Lee Gwak asked, but Go Jeon-ok gave no answer.

It was impossible for a dead man to reply, but Lee Gwak wanted to hear his answer.

After gazing at Go Jeon-ok for a long time, Lee Gwak carefully laid him on the ground. There were still martial artists of the Dark Moon Pavilion nearby.

They were looking at Lee Gwak with frightened expressions.

Lee Gwak said to them, “Take Jeon-ok away.”

“You’re… letting us go?”

One of the martial artists from the Dark Moon Pavilion asked cautiously.

Lee Gwak nodded silently. The surviving martial artists approached, picked up Go Jeon-ok’s body, and quietly disappeared.

Lee Gwak watched their receding figures for a moment before returning to Lee Cheong’s side.

“Father! Are you okay?”

“I’m fine!”

Lee Gwak forced a smile.

His heart was heavy, but he couldn’t show a gloomy face in front of his son.

Lee Cheong buried his face in Lee Gwak’s chest and hugged him. Lee Gwak patted Lee Cheong’s back and looked at Namgung Jin.

Namgung Jin was staring blankly at Lee Gwak, being supported by Namgung Yeon-hwa.

“To think there was such a warrior in the world.”

He was at a loss for words at Lee Gwak’s incredible martial prowess.

He had always taken pride in his skills, so the impact was even greater.

Lee Gwak was around his age, yet their martial prowess were leagues apart.

‘I was truly a frog in a well. To aim for the best under heaven with this meager level of martial arts. How shameful.’

The realization shook Namgung Jin deeply.

At the same time, he felt a sense of awe towards Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak was the first martial artist of his age to have achieved such a level of mastery.

Namgung Jin shook off Namgung Yeon-hwa’s support and cautiously walked toward Lee Gwak.

“Brother?”

“I’m okay.”

Namgung Jin struggled to walk up to Lee Gwak. Then he clasped his hands in salute.

“I, Namgung Jin of the Thousand Kingdom School, thank you for your assistance, great hero.”

“Don’t mind me, I did not do this to be thanked.”

“Still, it’s only right to repay your kindness. The Thousand Kingdom School never forgets its debts. Please, I’d like to invite you to visit the Thousand Kingdom School with me.”

“I’m sorry. I have somewhere I must go first, so I can’t promise when I’ll be able to visit.”

“Hmm!”

At Lee Gwak’s polite refusal, Namgung Jin could no longer insist on him coming to Thousand Kingdom School.

“I understand. Then at least allow us to treat you as long as you stay here.”

“Sigh! Very well.”

Lee Gwak exhaled and agreed, unable to refuse again. Only then did a satisfied expression appear on Namgung Jin’s face.

Having received Lee Gwak’s answer, Namgung Jin returned to his remaining men.

“Some of you gather the bodies of our comrades, and the rest spread out and extinguish the fire.”

“Yes, young master!”

“Understood.”

Those who survived answered in unison.

Their exhaustion was apparent. Their bodies felt like lead, but they knew this wasn’t the time for rest.

Some gathered the bodies of their comrades, while others worked to extinguish the flames.

Watching them, Lee Gwak couldn’t help but feel admiration.

“So, this is the resilience of a renowned family that has weathered the storms for so long.”

The way they put aside their personal grief to help the devastated Chaohu left a deep impression on Lee Gwak.

Even in the Jianghu where storms never ceased, a typhoon-like rumor struck.

—Sura Blade has reappeared in the Jianghu.

—Sura Blade Lee Gwak held the Jade Heaven Alliance accountable for causing the great fire in Chaohu.

Suddenly, rumors about Lee Gwak swept the world.

At first, no one believed the rumors.

Sura Blade Lee Gwak had been a forgotten existence for three years.

No one knew whether he was dead or alive, so it was hard to believe that he suddenly appeared and clashed with the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Many thought it was a desperate rumor started by the struggling Thousand Kingdom School. But soon, visitors to Chaohu confirmed the truth, and the news spread everywhere.

It was true that the Jade Heaven Alliance had caused a great fire in Chaohu.

Because of that, thousands of households were lost to the fire, and countless people lost their lives.

Chaohu was now a sea of tears.

Resentment towards the Jade Heaven Alliance pierced the sky, and curses against them were everywhere.

The people living in Chaohu were in despair. But even in the subdued atmosphere, people praised Lee Gwak.

For them, Lee Gwak had defeated the invaders who had brought such a disaster to their city.

Despite the grim atmosphere, people visited the inn where he resided to show their gratitude.

Only when they saw him with their own eyes did they realize that the rumors were true.

“The rumors were true.”

“Lee Gwak really defeated the elites of the Jade Heaven Alliance on his own. Just how great is his martial arts…”

“With this level of martial arts, he might even surpass the Eight Great Martial Artists and rival the Supreme Lords of the Ten Sects.”

A light of excitement appeared on people’s faces.

Right now, there were only ominous rumors in Jianghu.

Jade Heaven Alliance’s violent actions had sparked a backlash, and martial artists everywhere rose against them.

Some rose with righteous intent, while others simply sought to exploit the chaos to fulfill their own ambitions.

Countless innocents suffered due to the actions of these self-serving individuals. In such a dark age, a hero like Lee Gwak appeared as a beacon of hope.

In troubled times, people sought hope, and Lee Gwak became one of those hopes.

Lee Gwak himself never wanted to become someone’s hope. But the flow of the world was moving regardless of his wishes.

Shortly after the fire was contained, Thousand Kingdom School sent significant reinforcements to Chaohu.

Since Lee Gwak had driven out the martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance, they seized the opportunity to secure a foothold.

Ten or so ships belonging to the Thousand Kingdom School entered Chaohu carrying reconstruction materials.

Thanks to that, Chaohu regained some vitality after a long time. Though the sorrow of loss remained, the signs of activity provided some comfort.

“Uncle!”

Namgung Jin greeted a middle-aged man who led the Thousand Kingdom School’s reinforcements.

This strong, imposing figure was Namgung Hoe, deputy head of the Thousand Kingdom School and master of its most powerful organization, the Cloud Sword Hall.

Namgung Hoe was also the younger brother of Namgung Jin-geom, the supreme lord of the Thousand Kingdom School.

He bore the heavy responsibility of leading the sect in the absence of Namgung Jin-geom. He was that responsible, and his pride was considerable.

Upon hearing of the fire in Chaohu, he immediately gathered reinforcements and rushed to the city.

He looked around at the devastation and sighed.

“To think Chaohu would end up like this…”

In his memory, Chaohu was a beautiful city surrounded by natural wonders. To see it reduced to ashes overnight left him speechless.

“Forgive me. My incompetence prevented me from stopping their atrocities, even as I witnessed them firsthand.” Namgung Jin apologized

“You have nothing to apologize for. Who could have predicted such cruelty? That you survived is enough.”

“Uncle!”

“Where is he?”

“You mean, the hero Lee Gwak?”

“Is he truly deserving of the title?”

“He is more than deserving.”

“Hm!”

Namgung Hoe muttered to himself.

He knew his nephew’s pride well; He didn’t easily acknowledge someone of lower status than himself. For such a person to call a martial artist of similar age a hero.

‘For this child to acknowledge him to that extent?’

Namgung Hoe furrowed his brows deeply.

While the emergence of a new giant in the Jianghu was welcome, it was disturbing that Lee Gwak’s reputation had flourished within the domain of the Thousand Kingdom School.

Whether he knew his uncle’s thoughts or not, Namgung Jin told him where Lee Gwak was.

“He is currently at the Unhwa Inn.”

“Is the Unhwa Inn still intact?”

“It was far enough from where the fire started, so it remained unharmed.”

“Yes! I will guide you.”

Namgung Jin took the lead.

Namgung Hoe’s expression remained grim as he walked through the streets, taking in the devastation.

The once beautiful city had become blackened ruins. Everything in sight was burnt, and residents who had lost their homes overnight were living under tents.

Even though the Thousand Kingdom School was doing its utmost to provide support, there was no guarantee when Chaohu would regain its former appearance.

“Those heinous bastards! No matter how we’re at war with them, to cause such a massive fire.”

Namgung Hoe’s beard quivered with rage.

Although lawlessness reigned in the Jianghu, there were certain lines that should never be crossed. The massive fire started by the Jade Heaven Alliance had crossed those lines by far.

In Namgung Hoe’s heart, anger towards the Jade Heaven Alliance was burning like a wildfire.

“I will not spare a single son of a bitch associated with the Jade Heaven Alliance.

He vowed revenge.

They might forget favors, but they never forget grudges.

It was a creed passed down from the old Namgung Clan to the current Thousand Kingdom School.

“Uncle! We’ve arrived.”

At that moment, Namgung Jin’s voice awakened him from his thoughts.

When he regained his senses, he saw a large inn still standing, one of the few buildings to survive the fire, where Lee Gwak was said to be staying: Unhwa Inn.

As they entered, a woman inside looked up in surprise and approached them.

“Uncle!”

It was Namgung Yeon-hwa.

“You’ve been staying here too?”

“Yes, Uncle.”

“I heard you were injured. How are you feeling?”

“Fortunately, it wasn’t a serious injury. I’m almost fully healed now.”

“Well, thank goodness for that.”

“But, Uncle, did you come here to meet with the Great Hero?”

“Yes. Where is he now?”

“He’s in the outbuilding.”

“Let’s go.”

Without a moment’s hesitation, Namgung Hoe moved towards the outbuilding.

Namgung Jin and Namgung Yeon-hwa followed close behind.

Namgung Hoe walked briskly, pushing open the door to the outbuilding.

Inside, a young boy was practicing his blade techniques, while a man, appearing to be in his early thirties, sat watching him.

Namgung Hoe instinctively sensed that the man was Lee Gwok.

As his intuition suggested, the young martial artist was indeed Lee Gwak, and the boy practicing blade techniques in front of him was Lee Cheong.

Namgung Hoe strode towards Lee Gwak.

Noticing the unexpected guests,Lee Cheong paused his training, and Lee Gwak also turned his gaze toward Namgung Hoe.

“Are you Lee Gwak?”

“Yes, I am.”

“My name is Namgung Hoe. I’ve heard that our young master was saved thanks to you. On behalf of the Thousand Kingdom School, I would like to thank you.

“I wasn’t intending to save him specifically, so there’s no need for thanks.”

“Even so, we can’t let it go unacknowledged. If there’s anything you desire, please tell me. If it’s something the Thousand Kingdom School can provide, we’ll fulfill any request.”

“I don’t particularly want anything.”

“Don’t say that. Whatever it is…”

At Namgung Hoe’s coercive tone, Lee Gwak slightly furrowed his brow.
