Among the formations Lim Ji-mun knew was the Tenfold Phantom Formation.

As the name suggests, the Tenfold Phantom Formation created ten layers of illusions, tormenting the enemy with endless new phantoms no matter how many they destroyed. However, it lacked lethal capabilities and was rarely used, not to mention being extremely difficult to set up.

While Lee Gwak distracted the attention of the Loyal Sword Squad, Lim Ji-mun gathered people from the Jeongong Escort Agency and the Hao Clan and deployed the Tenfold Phantom Formation across the area.

Fortunately, the Loyal Sword Squad was completely fixated on Lee Gwak and failed to notice their movements.

“What the hell is this?”

“Damn it! Why has the scenery changed?”

The sudden shift in the scenery flustered the martial artists attacking Lee Gwak.

Swish!

A sharply honed sword shot out of the illusion and slashed at the

throat of a martial artist from the Loyal Sword Squad.

“Guhk!”

“What the—? Ugh!”

Screams erupted from all around as the martial artists of the Loyal Sword Squad fell one by one.

“What’s going on?”

“What is this?”

Goo Shin-chung’s beard trembled in rage.

He was shocked that a mere illusion formation could cause such damage.

He shouted at Lim Jimun.

“What did you do to the formation? Stop it now!”

“Hmm, I wonder what I did?”

A cold smile played on Lim Ji-mun’s lips.

He had hidden the Hao Clan and Jeongong Escort Agency martial artists behind the Tenfold Phantom Formation. Using the illusions as cover, they ambushed the Loyal Sword Squad from the shadows.

That was enough.

The chaos gave Lee Gwak and Oh Jung-gyeong a brief respite.

Lee Gwak and Lim Ji-mun’s eyes met in the air.

Lee Gwak gave a slight nod of gratitude, and Lim Ji-mun responded with a faint smile.

Then, Lim Ji-mun strode straight toward Goo Shin-chung.

There was no way Goo Shin-chung wouldn’t understand what that meant.

“You insolent brat!”

The young man before him had the audacity to challenge him alone.

Goo Shin-chung had been a renowned figure in the Jade Heaven Alliance long before Lim Ji-mun was born. No matter how talented Lim Ji-mun was—even if he had been personally taught by Jung Wol—the difference in their years of martial training and achievements was vast.

Of course, every now and then, a genius would emerge and overturn the Jianghu—but those were rare exceptions, usually backed by immense support from their sects.

Lee Gwak was an exception, but someone like him wasn’t common in the Jianghu.

Goo Shin-chung didn’t believe Lim Ji-mun was on Lee Gwak’s level.

“I’ll tear your body apart and feed you to the wolves!”

A fiery gleam appeared in Goo Shin-chung’s eyes.

It was the sign that he was about to unleash his ultimate technique—Ghost Demon Soul Sword

Goo Shin-chung charged at Lim Ji-mun, kicking off the ground.

In response, Lim Ji-mun drew his sword.

Oh Jung-gyeong found it strange to see Lim Ji-mun with a sword. Until now, he’d always seen him holding a wine bottle instead, appearing perpetually drunk rather than sharp-witted.

Oh Jung-gyeong had subconsciously thought that Lim Ji-mun was just a drunkard who liked his drink too much. But the sight of him wielding a sword took his breath away.

Clang-clang-clang!

As Lim Ji-mun and Goo Shin-chung’s swords clashed, the metallic sounds echoed like summer rain pelting a steel plate.

“Ah!”

Oh Jung-gyeong couldn’t help but gasp.

Lim Ji-mun was not being overwhelmed by Goo Shin-chung.

While Goo Shin-chung had the edge in raw internal energy, Lim Ji-mun surpassed him in sharpness and adaptability.

“So he was hiding his true strength all along.”

A faint smile touched Oh Jung-gyeong’s lips.

Thanks to Lim Ji-mun’s intervention, the tide of battle had turned.

The Tenfold Phantom Formation had disrupted the enemy’s formation, causing their coordinated attacks to collapse.

The martial artists from the Escort Agency and Hao Clan continued to harass the Loyal Sword Squad using the illusions. Now, it was Joo Shin-yoon who was getting flustered.

‘Damn it!’

If this dragged on, the Wudang Sect would inevitably intervene.

If they could just kill Lee Gwak, even becoming an enemy of the Wudang Sect wouldn’t be too costly. However, if they failed to kill Lee Gwak and also provoked the Wudang Sect, they would gain nothing and only make more enemies.

That was the worst-case scenario Joo Shin-yoon had envisioned.

He had to prevent that at all costs.

“Attack Lee Gwak! No matter what, he must die!”

Just as he whispered those words to the Loyal Sword Squad—

Lee Gwak’s gaze locked directly onto him.

Joo Shin-yoon suddenly felt a chill in his chest.

‘No way…’

He was dressed identically to the Loyal Sword Squad, blending in perfectly. Distinguishing him should have been nearly impossible—at least, by conventional logic.

Joo Shin-yoon cautiously took a half-step to the left. Lee Gwak’s eyes followed precisely.

Only then did he realize that Lee Gwak had singled him out—he must have sensed the faint whisper earlier.

Joo Shin-yoon clenched his fists.

Thud. Thud.

Lee Gwak was approaching.

“Stop him!”

The Loyal Sword Squad rushed to intercept, but none of them lasted more than a few exchanges before falling.

Shhhk! Swish!

Lee Gwak’s blade continued to slice through the air.

His meridians were stiffening, and it was getting harder to circulate his internal energy. But his blade remained razor-sharp- no, it was growing even more refined and precise as time passed.

Joo Shin-yoon couldn’t comprehend this change.

‘Could he have completely shaken off the Sun Cutting Acid’s effects? No, that’s impossible. No matter how unorthodox his martial arts are, he shouldn’t be able to fully escape its effect.’

He was right.

Lee Gwak had almost no internal energy left. But his blade still carried terrifying power.

Seeking maximum efficiency within the restriction of his blocked meridians, Lee Gwak began to see new paths in his bladesmanship.

He was struck by a sudden insight

“The blade is the ultimate tool for killing. Even without internal energy, a blade can kill. So why obsess over energy?”

If a slash could kill with or without internal energy, then there was no reason to obsess over internal energy.

As long as he avoided direct clashes with strikes infused with internal energy, he could rely purely on the blade’s inherent lethality—cutting, thrusting, and sweeping.

Lee Gwak returned to the basics he had learned under Gwang No-ya. A new world opened before him.

Lee Gwak stepped into this new world.

Ping!

The sound of an arrow whistling through the air echoed as Lee Gwak’s blade moved. Another Loyal Sword Squad martial artist fell.

He dodged or deflected incoming strikes and exploited openings to deliver fatal blows.

The way he moved was chillingly beautiful.

Though it’s strange to say about someone killing others, Lee Gwak looked almost graceful.

Joo Shin-yoon shuddered.

He felt fear.

Objectively, he still held the advantage.

Though many had died, the Loyal Sword Squad still had numbers, and Joo Shin-yoon himself was an unmatched master.

He was known as the Phantom Moon Sword.

Aside from the Alliance Lord Ja Hong-cheon, few in the Jade Heaven Alliance could confidently defeat him.

This fear wasn’t born from weakness.

He was simply overwhelmed by Lee Gwak.

Despite his sealed meridians, Lee Gwak unleashed terrifying martial prowess, suffocating Joo Shin-yoon with his sheer presence.

“You bastard!”

Joo Shin-yoon roared, channeling his internal energy to shake off his fear.

Now he knew.

Now that Lee Gwak had locked onto him, there was no escaping—no matter what tricks he used. And if he allowed himself to be consumed by fear now, he would never escape Lee Gwak’s shadow.

“I’ll kill you!”

Despite his immense power, Joo Shin-yoon had always relied on subordinates to handle enemies. This was the first time in over twenty years that he had personally stepped into battle.

His sword emitted a dazzling light and stretched out.

Sword Qi

Whoosh!

The sword qi shot toward Lee Gwak.

Unable to block it head-on, Lee Gwak twisted his body to deflect it.

But in that instant, Joo Shin-yoon subtly twisted his wrist. The sword qi’s trajectory curved toward Lee Gwak again.

No matter how sharp Lee Gwak’s blade was, clashing with sword qi without internal energy would cleave both the blade and Lee Gwak in two.

Lee Gwak dodged with Revolving Steps while flinging a handful of dirt at Joo Shin-yoon to disrupt his vision.

“You think cheap tricks like that will work?!”

Joo Shin-yoon shouted, swinging his sleeve. A powerful gust of wind scattered the dust.

He was sharp and experienced.

Crushing Lee Gwak’s tactics, he pressed his advantage.

Swoosh!

The sword qi grazed Lee Gwak’s head by a hair’s breadth.

Joo Shin-yoon left no openings.

His signature technique, the Frost Moon Sword Art, was among the finest in the Jianghu, and he had mastered it to its peak.

Though he hadn’t fought seriously in over two decades, his relentless daily training kept his instincts razor-sharp.

He ruthlessly exploited Lee Gwak’s inability to use internal energy, bombarding him with sword qi.

Just as he intended, Lee Gwak was pushed back, unable to launch any meaningful counterattack.

Occasionally, Lee Gwak flung dirt or weapons scattered on the ground, but none of it worked on Joo Shin-yoon.

The deflected blades were lodged uselessly in the earth.

Excitement gleamed in Joo Shin-yoon’s eyes.

The fear he had felt earlier now seemed foolish.

“Is this all you’ve got? Then you die by my hand.”

He charged in triumphantly.

He pressed the attack, exhilarated at the thought of personally killing Lee Gwak, the Jade Heaven Alliance’s greatest enemy.

The Frost Moon Sword Art’s deadly techniques rained down.

Each sword qi strike cornered Lee Gwak further.

“It’s over, Lee Gwak!”

His blade shone even more brightly.

There was no need for finesse now.

He aimed to end it with one strike, cutting Lee Gwak and his blade in half.

“It’s over.”

“Victory to the Lord!”

The warriors of the Loyal Sword Squad were certain of Joo Shin-yoon’s triumph.

But then—

Whoosh!

Lee Gwak’s aura changed.

The man who had been retreating helplessly was gone. His icy gaze sent shivers down Joo Shin-yoon’s spine.

Lee Gwak kicked a nearby sword on the ground.

Ping!

The blade shot toward Joo Shin-yoon’s throat like an arrow.

Forced to abort his attack, Joo Shin-yoon recalled his sword aura to deflect it.

Slash!

In that instant, Lee Gwak’s blade flew toward his heart.

“Bastard!”

Joo Shin-yoon swung his Sword Qi in panic, but Lee Gwak had already shifted to the side. There—almost miraculously—was another sword stuck upside down in the ground.

Thunk!

Lee Gwak kicked it.

The sword flew out like an arrow, aiming for Joo Shin-yoon’s throat.

Joo Shin-yoon was forced to retract the sword qi he was extending towards Lee Gwak and deflect the sword.

Clang!

He angrily bisected the flying sword with his sword aura.

But the distraction cost him.

Lee Gwak’s blade struck like a viper, aiming for his vital points.

Joo Shin-yoon bent his waist backward to dodge the strike.

Slice!

But he couldn’t completely avoid injury. Lee Gwak’s blade left a long gash across his shoulder.

Slick!

“You—!”

The sharp pain ignited Joo Shin-yoon’s fury.

At that moment, Lee Gwak had already stepped back, distancing himself from Joo Shin-yoon. And at the spot where he retreated to, another sword was stuck upside down in the ground.

Thud!

Lee Gwak kicked the sword, sending it flying toward Joo Shin-yoon.

Joo Shin-yoon was dumbfounded when he saw yet another sword flying at him. How could it be that wherever Lee Gwak moved, a sword was conveniently stuck upside down, ready to be kicked?

Joo Shin-yoon realized something was wrong.

As he deflected the sword Lee Gwak had kicked, he looked around—and finally saw what he hadn’t noticed until now.

‘When did this happen?’

Dozens of swords were embedded in the ground around him, arranged in a perfect circle as if they had been there all along.

Joo Shin-yoon recalled the moment Lee Gwak had first started flinging swords.

Back then, Lee Gwak had thrown the swords seemingly at random, and he had simply deflected them away without a second thought.

Now, however, the swords stuck upside down in the ground were the very ones he had carelessly deflected.

And each of them was now perfectly positioned—angled just right for Lee Gwak to kick.

A chill ran down Joo Shin-yoon’s spine.

“Did he plan all of this from the very beginning…?”
