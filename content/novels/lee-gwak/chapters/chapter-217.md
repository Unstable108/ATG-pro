Someone called out Lee Gwak’s name from behind.

As Lee Gwak stopped and turned around, he saw a familiar face. The one who had called him was Peng Sooyoon, whom he had met at the inn.

Peng Sooyoon strode towards Lee Gwak and asked,

“That’s what they call me in the Jianghu.”

“And you wield the blade well enough to be called a ‘Sura’?”

“It’s been forgotten now, but a long time ago, the Peng family had a sword technique called the Five Tigers Sword. I believe that only the Five Tigers Sword truly deserves the title of ‘Sura.’

Before the Jianghu was reorganized into the Ten Sects, there existed the Nine Great Sects and the Five Great Families. The Great Heavenly Blood War a hundred years ago completely overturned the order and fate of the Jianghu.

The Peng family was one of those whose fate had changed.

For hundreds of years, as one of the Five Great Families, the Peng family had played a significant role in determining the order of the Jianghu. However, they fell during the Great Heavenly Blood War and were eventually absorbed by the Thousand Kingdom School. But that did not mean their deep-rooted pride had disappeared.

Peng Sooyoon was no different.

He took great pride in being a Peng, more than anyone else. He also had a unique pride in the Five Tigers Sword, a legacy of the Northern Peng family.

The look in Peng Sooyoon’s eyes as he gazed at Lee Gwak wasn’t filled with mere competitiveness.

Namgung Yeonhwa, who had come with him, showed interest in Lee Gwak, and Dark Martial Empress Dan Li Yeon, whom he had shown interest in, also ignored him in favor of talking to Lee Gwak.

All these things accumulated and angered him.

“Peng Sooyoon of the Thousand Kingdom School challenges you. If you consider yourself a true martial artist, I believe you will accept my challenge.”

“We have just met today. Is there really a need for this?”

“It’s a duel between martial artists. If you do not accept this duel, you cannot call yourself a true martial artist.”

“Very well. I accept your challenge.”

Finally, as Lee Gwak accepted, a smile formed on Peng Sooyoon’s lips.

Lee Gwak was already a well-known master. It was clear to him that if he could defeat Lee Gwak in an instant, Lee Gwak’s fame would become his own.

Turning around, Lee Gwak said, “This place is not suitable for fighting. Let’s go somewhere quiet.”

“Hmph! It seems you fear the eyes of the public. But I am not afraid of them.”

The streets were crowded, and the people watched Lee Gwak and Peng Sooyoon with great interest.

They were people living around Jade Heaven Alliance. Naturally, they were sensitive to such atmospheres.

The people sensed the hostile vibe between the two and instinctively knew something was about to happen.

Peng Sooyoon wanted to defeat Lee Gwak in front of all these people and gain fame.

The onlookers in this street would prove his victory.

Lee Gwak read Peng Sooyoon’s intentions and sighed softly. But the next moment, his gaze changed.

What seemed relaxed turned fierce.

“Very well. I will accept your challenge here.”

“Hmph! That’s how it should be. Come, I will give you three seconds out of consideration for your reputation.”

Peng Sooyoon flicked his hand with an arrogant expression.

He even placed his remaining hand behind his waist, like a supreme being.

This was usually the posture a master would take when facing an inferior opponent. Peng Sooyoon was clearly underestimating Lee Gwak.

“Hmph! Are you scared now that we’re about to fight? Come! Prove to me that your reputation is not unfounded.”

In an instant, Lee Gwak’s figure vanished from Peng Sooyoon’s view.

Instead, a sound like the turning of gears echoed in Peng Sooyoon’s ears.

Startled, Peng Sooyoon drew the sword he was wearing at his waist.

Although he had boasted about giving a three-second head start, an intense sense of crisis made him unknowingly execute the critical strike of the Five Tigers Sword.

Five Tigers Emerging from the Cave.

Like five tigers rushing out of a cave towards their prey, Peng Sooyoon’s sword also split into five, slicing through the air.

Even though it might damage his pride, Peng Sooyoon was confident that this strike would block Lee Gwak’s surprise attack.

At that moment, the sound of clashing metal burst forth.

Only then did Peng Sooyoon realize that something had gone wrong. But by then, it was too late.

His sword, which he had swung with the technique of Five Tigers Emerging from the Cave, missed and sliced through the air instead. Lee Gwak, who had closed in with his revolving steps, had deflected it with his Leaf Blade.

Peng Sooyoon widened his eyes in shock as his sword flew away, trying to retrieve it and attack Lee Gwak again. But by then, Lee Gwak had already thrust into his chest.

Peng Sooyoon was flung backward with a sound like a leather drum bursting. Lee Gwak’s palm had exploded onto his chest.

Blood spurted from Peng Sooyoon’s wide-open mouth. His consciousness was already half gone.

Peng Sooyoon rolled on the ground, looking pitiful.

At that moment, someone ran out and embraced Peng Sooyoon.

The woman, dazzlingly beautiful, was none other than Namgung Yeonhwa.

Her eyes were as unsettled as her inner thoughts.

Peng Sooyoon was a young prodigy recognized even in the Thousand Kingdom School, arrogant but with skills to match. Yet, he crumbled under just one move from Lee Gwak.

It was a sight so unbelievable even as she saw it with her own eyes. It was that shocking.

Peng Sooyoon and her own martial abilities were not much different. This meant she would also not stand a chance against Lee Gwak in a moment’s confrontation.

‘To possess such martial prowess…’

Namgung Yeonhwa bit her lip hard.

She had not stopped Peng Sooyoon from following Lee Gwak out because she believed in his skills, but also because she was curious about Lee Gwak’s martial prowess, rumored to be extraordinary. And having witnessed Lee Gwak’s prowess with her own eyes, it was not just shocking but terrifying.

Moreover, Lee Gwak had neutralized Peng Sooyoon without even drawing his blade.

‘Just how profound is his true martial prowess…’

Namgung Yeonhwa had many questions for Lee Gwak. However, looking at him standing there, solitary and dignified, she found herself speechless.

Lee Gwak looked down at Namgung Yeonhwa and spoke.

“As you can see, it was a fair duel. I trust this matter will not be made into an issue.”

“Then, I shall take my leave…”

After giving a fist salute, Lee Gwak turned around.

Namgung Yeonhwa stretched out her hand too late to reach him.

Many people in the street had watched their exchange.

“To subdue a martial artist of the Thousand Kingdom School in a moment.”

“And he didn’t even draw his blade.”

“He’s called the Sura for a reason.”

The murmuring voices of the people pierced Namgung Yeonhwa’s ears like sharp daggers.

“It must be. The martial artist Lee Gwak who disappeared from Celestial Demon Troupe six years ago can only be our dad.”

The expressions on the faces of Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah were more serious than ever as they returned to their residence. The mention of Lee Gwak within the confines of Noh Tae-tae’s dwelling had deeply troubled them.

Their hearts were racing more than ever. Ever since they heard the name Lee Gwak, their hearts hadn’t calmed down and were pounding uncontrollably.

“He’s at the Jade Heaven Alliance now?”

“That’s exactly what was said.”

Lee Soo-ah clasped her small hands over her chest. Her face was flushed, and tears glistened in her eyes.

She had never seen him in her life, but not a single day had gone by when she forgot his name.

Han So-cheon had often spoken to them about Lee Gwak.

About meeting Lee Gwak, the events at the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall in Mount Sohua, life in the Jade Heaven Alliance, and how he had rushed through the enemy lines to save her.

To Lee Soo-ah, Lee Gwak was the hero who saved her mother and an infinitely reliable guardian.

Tears that had been welling up in Lee Soo-ah’s eyes finally fell.

Lee Cheong, wiping away her tears with his sleeve, said, “Don’t cry! Like a fool. Now’s not the time to cry. Dad’s in danger.”

Lee Soo-ah’s tears stopped as if by magic.

“They said they would send two of the Four Heavenly Guests. Even for Dad, facing those two at the same time won’t be easy.”

“We need to warn Dad. And we have to let him know we’re here. He doesn’t know we exist.”

Lee Cheong’s voice was calm, uncharacteristic of a child.

Though his body was weak enough to require life-extending pills from the White Light Sect, his intellect was unparalleled.

Lee Soo-ah bit her small lips, looking at Lee Cheong, hoping he would come up with a solution.

It was a while before Lee Cheong broke the silence.

The unexpected suggestion shook Lee Soo-ah’s eyes. However, Lee Cheong was resolute.

“Then what about you? You’re coming too, right?”

“If you’re not going, neither am I.”

“As you know, I can’t survive without the life-extending pills. But you’re different. You’re free.”

Lee Cheong held Lee Soo-ah’s small shoulders and met her gaze.

They could understand each other’s intentions without needing to speak. Yet, Lee Cheong’s firm stance meant his resolve was strong.

“We can’t live like this forever. We’re hostages. They’re using us to control Mom, making her commit murders. If this continues, not only will I die, but Mom will too. This isn’t living. Living like this is really…”

At a glance, it seemed they lived in freedom, but the only place they could freely roam was inside the mansion.

The moment they stepped outside, numerous watchful eyes followed, and every move was reported back to White Light Sect.

Because of this, Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah had never truly experienced freedom.

Lee Cheong’s resolute decision was conveyed to Lee Soo-ah.

“If I disappear, they will torment you.”

“Even then, they won’t kill me. If they do, Mom won’t listen to them anymore.”

Lee Soo-ah took a deep breath.

She realized that she couldn’t change Lee Cheong’s mind. And somehow, she found herself persuaded by him as well.

“Alright. I’ll go to Dad. But there’s a problem. To get to Dad, I need to escape from here first.”

“I’ve already thought of a way.”

Lee Cheong answered confidently.

He had always dreamed of freedom. That’s why he had thought of ways to escape every day.

It was a kind of hobby, something like a goal that must be achieved someday. Until now, he hadn’t acted because there was no reason to escape, but things had changed.

He had become a fearsome master known as the Sura Blade, renowned throughout the world.

He had emerged as a great master, so formidable that even the lord of the White Light Sect and Noh Tae-tae would hesitate to confront him.

Lee Gwak would surely come to rescue them.

He would free them and their mom from this hellish place and protect them.

Lee Cheong believed so, even though he had never met his dad.

“Sister, listen carefully to what I’m about to say.”

“There’s a moment every ten days when the external surveillance slacks. That moment will come in two days. You need to seize that opportunity. So…”

Lee Cheong’s voice lowered, but Lee Soo-ah didn’t miss a single word of what he said.

Lee Soo-ah nodded again and again.

Two days later, the White Light Sect was in an uproar.

Lee Soo-ah, who had been confined to the mansion, had vanished without a trace.

Won Gong-yeo, the leader of the White Light Sect, asked Lee Cheong with a murderous aura.

“You don’t know? Do you expect me to believe that?”

“How should I know where my sister has gone if she disappeared while I was asleep? Someone must have taken her.

“It doesn’t make sense otherwise. How could my sister escape from here on her own?”

Won Gong-yeo furrowed her brows at Lee Cheong’s brazen answer. His story sounded plausible.

This was a place under tight surveillance 24 hours a day. It was nearly impossible for a child to escape on their own, no matter how smart Lee Soo-ah was.

“I hope for your sake that what you’re saying is true. Otherwise, you will pay the price.”

“Please find my sister. I can’t survive a day without her.”

Lee Cheong said, his eyes welling up with tears. Faced with his appearance, Won Gong-yeo couldn’t press further. No, there was no time to press further.

She had to recapture Lee Soo-ah as soon as possible.

Won Gong-yeo ordered her subordinates.

“Find that child at all costs. Use whatever means necessary.”

White Light Sect’s elite tracking team mobilized to chase after the disappeared girl.
