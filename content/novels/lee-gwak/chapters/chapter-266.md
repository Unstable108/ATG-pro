Ban Woo-yeom gritted his teeth.

“Who would have thought we’d encounter the Green Heaven Society here?”

The green flag fluttering atop the swift boat was the emblem of the Green Heaven Society.

The Green Heaven Society was a bandit group that emerged during the war.

They rejected Sky High Castle, the main stronghold of the Green Forest bandits. Despite being bandits themselves, they refused to operate under Sky High Castle’s influence.

Before the war, the Green Heaven Society would have been eradicated by Sky High Castle before they could expand. However, Sky High Castle was currently too preoccupied with the war against the Jade Heaven Alliance to concern itself with external matters.

Seizing this opportunity, the Green Heaven Society expanded their forces rapidly.

While Sky High Castle prohibited meaningless plunder, the Green Heaven Society was different. They engaged in anything profitable—robbery, looting, even contract killings—without hesitation.

They didn’t adhere to even the minimal codes of conduct, committing indiscriminate looting and becoming a scourge of the Jianghu. Many suffered at their hands, but with the war raging, no martial sect could afford to subdue them.

The Green Heaven Society had appeared just a year ago, but in that short time, they had gained immense notoriety.

To merchants and escort agencies, the Green Heaven Society was more terrifying than the Jade Heaven Alliance or the Seven Sects.

“But I thought they weren’t operating along the Yangtze River. Could they have expanded here while we were away at Kunlun?”

The swift boat was gradually approaching.

As it drew nearer to the ship of the Sanghyeon Escort Agency, excitement gleamed in the bandits’ eyes.

The Green Heaven Society was known for strict discipline.

During raids, they had to follow the leader’s orders without question; disobedience meant execution. However, no matter the orders, they couldn’t suppress the primal excitement that surged at the prospect of imminent plunder.

The bandits’ gazes turned toward the man standing at the bow of their swift boat.

He appeared to be in his mid-thirties.

His overall impression was sharp, particularly his piercing eyes filled with malice that sent chills down one’s spine.

He was Yuk Dal-hon, the First Division Leader of the Green Heaven Society.

As the Sanghyeon Escort Agency’s ship drew closer, the smile on Yuk Dal-hon’s lips deepened.

“What valuable goods must they be transporting to warrant such tight security?”

There were twenty escorts without counting the regular crew.

Mobilizing that many people meant the cargo they were transporting was exceedingly precious.

Yuk Dal-hon shouted, infusing his voice with internal energy.

“Surrender your goods immediately and jump into the water, and we will spare your lives. Resist, and you’ll meet the most brutal death imaginable.”

His eyes were fixed squarely on Ban Woo-yeom, the leader of the Sanghyeon Escort Agency.

“Ugh!”

Ban Woo-yeom groaned.

The force of Yuk Dal-hon’s shout shook his heart meridians—a testament to the profound internal energy Yuk Dal-hon possessed.

‘He might be my equal, or perhaps even surpass me. Today, misfortune outweighs fortune.’

He wanted to hand over the cargo and save their lives. But doing so would mean no one would ever entrust their goods to the Sanghyeon Escort Agency again.

An escort agency’s lifeblood was its credibility, and Ban Woo-yeom valued trust above all else.

He shouted back, also infusing his voice with internal energy.

“That is not possible. The Sanghyeon Escort Agency always protects the goods entrusted to us.”

“Hmph! So you choose punishment over wise counsel.”

Yuk Dal-hon turned around.

His subordinates stood ready, weapons in hand, eager to act.

These weren’t mere bandits.

Yuk Dal-hon was confident that his men possessed martial skills superior to the elite martial artists of Sky High Castle.

They had already reached such a level, having been meticulously trained by Yuk Dal-hon himself.

He pointed toward the Sanghyeon Escort Agency’s ship. At his signal, his subordinates leaped into action.

“Let’s go!”

“Kill them all and take everything!”

They had conducted countless raids.

There was no hesitation, no restraint.

In an instant, they boarded the Sanghyeon Escort Agency’s ship.

“Defend!”

“Hyah!”

The escorts of the Sanghyeon Escort Agency swung their weapons, attacking the bandits.

Clang! Clang!

The sound of clashing weapons echoed across the deck.

The escorts and the bandits engaged in fierce combat. Despite their valiant efforts, the escorts were outnumbered and outmatched in martial prowess.

“Argh!”

“Ugh!”

One after another, escorts fell wounded.

The bandits of the Green Heaven Society were ruthless. Even with superior martial skills, they didn’t hesitate to attack together.

“You scoundrels!”

Enraged by the deaths of his comrades, whom he regarded as family, Ban Woo-yeom sprang into action.

He drew his sword and leaped into the fray.

Ban Woo-yeom unleashed his family’s ultimate technique, the Fire Soul Eighteen Forms.

Swish!

Sword energy danced like blossoms blooming and fading in an instant.

“Ugh!”

“Damn it!”

In a flash, three bandits were wounded and fell. But that was all.

The remaining bandits avoided direct confrontation with Ban Woo-yeom, opting instead to attack the other escorts.

“You cowards!”

Infuriated, Ban Woo-yeom tried to chase them down.

Clang!

But someone blocked his path.

It was Yuk Dal-hon.

In his hand was a bizarre spear.

It resembled a harpoon used for catching fish—a long, sharp metal spike.

“Old man, I’ll be your opponent.”

“Step aside.”

Ban Woo-yeom unleashed a stroke of the Fire Soul Eighteen Forms, but Yuk Dal-hon deflected it effortlessly.

Though Ban Woo-yeom was much older and had trained longer, Yuk Dal-hon’s internal energy was far more profound.

His inner strength was beyond Ban Woo-yeom’s imagination.

Clang!

“Ugh!”

Ban Woo-yeom’s face twisted as a powerful recoil numbed his grip.

The shock tore the skin between his thumb and index finger, causing blood to flow.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

Yuk Dal-hon’s spear descended like a downpour.

Despite his best efforts, wounds began to accumulate on Ban Woo-yeom’s body.

In no time, he was drenched in blood.

“Grandfather!”

A girl’s scream pierced the chaos.

It was Ban Seol-hwa.

She was struggling, having been captured by a bandit.

“Let me go!”

“Heh heh! You’re not just any pretty girl. Our Leader will surely reward us handsomely for bringing you.”

“Ah!”

Ban Seol-hwa resisted with all her might, but she couldn’t break free from the bandit’s iron grip.

“Seol-hwa!”

Seeing his granddaughter in peril, Ban Woo-yeom’s spirit wavered.

Dealing with Yuk Dal-hon was already overwhelming, and now his granddaughter was in danger. His movements became frantic. Yuk Dal-hon seized the moment.

Slash!

“Urgh!”

A deep wound opened in Ban Woo-yeom’s abdomen, and he fell to his knees.

“Grandfather!”

Seeing this, tears streamed down Ban Seol-hwa’s face.

“Tsk! You should have handed over the goods when you had the chance…”

Yuk Dal-hon clicked his tongue, looking down at the kneeling Ban Woo-yeom.

Clutching his bleeding abdomen, Ban Woo-yeom looked up at Yuk Dal-hon.

“Please, spare my granddaughter. She’s just a child.”

“Hmph! A girl is a girl, no matter how young. She can be useful in many ways if raised properly.”

“No, you can’t!”

“You should have heeded our advice.”

Yuk Dal-hon raised his bizarre spear high.

“Don’t!”

Ban Seol-hwa reached out toward her grandfather, but she was too far away.

Yuk Dal-hon thrust his spear down toward Ban Woo-yeom’s heart.

Clang!

At that moment, the sound of metal rang out as Yuk Dal-hon’s spear was deflected.

He grabbed his trembling spear, shouting.

“Who goes there?”

Clang!

A distorted coin fell to the deck.

Someone had thrown a coin to block Yuk Dal-hon’s spear.

His palm tingled from the impact.

“A master?”

Immense force had been channeled into that small coin.

Either an expert in hidden weapons or someone with unfathomable internal energy.

Either way, it was bad news for Yuk Dal-hon.

Just then, footsteps echoed softly on the deck.

Someone emerged from the cabin, walking toward Yuk Dal-hon.

The man didn’t appear particularly remarkable aside from his tall stature. His eyebrows were thick, but his eyes were gentle, and his facial features were soft, giving him a somewhat delicate appearance.

Moreover, his face was tanned like that of a farmer, making him seem like an ordinary villager at first glance.

But the moment he saw the man, Yuk Dal-hon felt a chill run down his spine.

His heart pounded heavily from the moment he laid eyes on him.

His body reacted instinctively.

The man was Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak’s gaze fell on Ban Woo-yeom.

“Are you alright?”

“I… I…”

Ban Woo-yeom stammered.

He was so shocked that his mind went blank. He couldn’t think at all.

Until now, he had considered Lee Gwak an ordinary martial artist. There had been nothing particularly noteworthy about him. But now, an indescribable aura emanated from Lee Gwak.

Yuk Dal-hon was the first to notice this.

He held his spear and respectfully saluted.

“I was unaware that a master was aboard. I am Yuk Dal-hon, First Division Leader of the Green Heaven Society. May I have the honor of knowing your esteemed name?”

“I am Lee Gwak.”

“Lee Gwak?”

Yuk Dal-hon furrowed his brow.

He felt he had heard the name somewhere before, but couldn’t recall when.

“Are you affiliated with the Sanghyeon Escort Agency?”

“No, I’m not.”

“Then that’s fortunate. If you pretend you didn’t see anything, we won’t trouble you. In fact, we’ll even share some of the goods. How does that sound?”

“……”

“It would save us both some trouble. You gain wealth without lifting a finger, and we avoid unnecessary complications.”

Yuk Dal-hon’s voice was smooth and persuasive.

Unable to gauge Lee Gwak’s martial prowess, he attempted to win him over.

“I cannot agree to that.”

But Lee Gwak’s reply was not what he had hoped for.

“Are you willing to make an enemy of the Green Heaven Society?”

Yuk Dal-hon’s eyes sharpened.

He thought the name of the Green Heaven Society might instill fear, but Lee Gwak seemed unfazed.

Unbeknownst to him, Lee Gwak had never even heard of the Green Heaven Society. He had no reason to be afraid.

This time, Lee Gwak spoke.

“Leave the ship now. Then no one has to die.”

“Ha! You expect us to leave empty-handed?”

Yuk Dal-hon’s face twisted with rage.

Even though he realized Lee Gwak was an extraordinary master, he had faith in his subordinates.

He commanded over forty elite martial artists.

He couldn’t believe that a single man could be an obstacle. He was prepared to accept some losses.

Yuk Dal-hon shouted.

“Kill him!”

“Charge!”

“Die!”

At his command, the bandits lunged at Lee Gwak without hesitation.

At that moment, Lee Gwak reached toward the deck. A wooden practice sword, likely used for training, flew into his grasp.

Without hesitation, Lee Gwak swung the wooden sword horizontally.

Boom!

“Argh!”

“Ugh!”

In an instant, about ten bandits were blown away, plunging into the water.

An invisible force had struck them.

They floated motionless on the surface—they had all been knocked unconscious.

“What the…?”

“This is insane!”

Shock and fear spread across the bandits’ faces.

Only then did they realize that Lee Gwak was a master beyond comprehension.

Even as they watched, bandits continued to be hurled off the ship and into the river. Their screams and the splashes of water echoed continuously.

In a matter of moments, all forty bandits were in the river, leaving only Yuk Dal-hon on the ship.

Yuk Dal-hon’s eyes quivered.

“A master of this caliber…”

The Green Heaven Society always planned for every possibility. They had detailed information about the Sanghyeon Escort Agency’s personnel. Yet nowhere in their data was there mention of a man named Lee Gwak.

Tap. Tap.

Lee Gwak approached Yuk Dal-hon, holding the wooden sword loosely at his side.

He seemed as casual as if he were taking a leisurely stroll. But having witnessed his subordinates being effortlessly dispatched by this seemingly relaxed man, Yuk Dal-hon couldn’t remain calm.

“Yaaaah!”

Letting out a fierce cry, Yuk Dal-hon charged at Lee Gwak.

He unleashed the same spear technique that had defeated Ban Woo-yeom.

Clang!

A metallic sound rang out.

At the same time, Yuk Dal-hon’s spear was deflected, leaving his chest exposed.

Crunch!

Lee Gwak’s leaf-hand blade landed squarely on his chest.
