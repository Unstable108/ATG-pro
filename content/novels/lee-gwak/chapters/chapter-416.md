A large altar stood on the platform.

On the altar was a huge incense burner engraved with the Eight Trigrams symbol.

The Taoists of the Wudang Sect, including the Elders Cheongsong and Jinghae; had gathered before the giant incense burner.

They were preparing for the most important event of the Opening Ceremony.

A declaration to the Primordial Heavenly Lord of the Sect’s return to the Jianghu.

Nothing was more significant to the Wudang Sect than this.

It was no exaggeration to say that they had spent the past several years preparing and moving solely for this moment.

By announcing their return to the Primordial Heavenly Lord, the Wudang Sect would once again set foot in the Jianghu and reclaim their lost glory.

After lighting the incense, Elder Cheongsong bowed to the heavens and recited the prepared prayer.

“Primordial Heavenly Lord, we, the Wudang Sect, now prepare to reopen the mountain gates that have long been sealed. Amidst the storms of the world, we vow to press forward without wavering. We pledge that Wudang shall always stand for light and righteousness, never bowing before injustice or tyranny. We shall preserve the reputation and virtue built by our ancestors and spare no effort for the justice of the martial world. Our Wudang Sect…”

Elder Cheongsong’s words continued for a long while after.

The Taoists of the Wudang Sect could not conceal their excitement.

After enduring years of hardship, they were finally stepping back into the martial world—how could their hearts not race?

It was the moment they had waited for. Everyone’s heart was pounding.

Doom! Doom! Doom!

The thunderous beats of the great drum, synchronized with Elder Cheongsong’s prayer, made their hearts beat even faster.

“Primordial Heavenly Lord, we ask for your blessing upon the Wudang Sect as we venture into this turbulent world.”

Finally, Elder Cheongsong’s prayer concluded.

Shing!

At that moment, Jinghae drew his sword and pointed it toward the sky. As if they had been waiting for this signal, the disciples of the Wudang Sect simultaneously unsheathed their swords.

Hummm!

Their swords, aimed at the heavens, trembled before erupting in a unified blaze of light.

“Sword Qi!”

“Heavens! So many of them are unleashing Sword Qi at once…”

The gathered martial artists were stunned.

The sight of over a hundred Taoists simultaneously releasing Sword Qi was nothing short of shocking.

Moreover, most of those wielding Sword Qi were young disciples. Though a few first-generation disciples were among them, the majority were second- and third-generation disciples.

The spectacle of these young taoists unleashing Sword Qi left a deep impression on the martial artists.

It was undeniable proof of the Wudang Sect’s bright future.

“The Wudang Sect’s foundation is truly formidable. To nurture so many masters in just three or four generations…”

“They were once the leader of the Nine Great Sects—truly, their reputation is well-earned.”

The martial display filled the spectators not only with admiration but with fear.

The Seven Great Sects had no shortage of masters at that level.

The difference was that the Seven Great Sects had dominated the Jianghu for nearly a century, whereas the Wudang Sect had cultivated so many masters while sealed away.

Despite the restrictions of their seclusion, they had still managed to nurture so many experts. Now that they were opening their doors again, it was impossible to predict how many more they would raise.

With this single display of might, the Wudang Sect imprinted a powerful impression upon the hearts of the gathered martial artists.

The elders of the Wudang Sect gazed at their disciples with proud expressions.

Among the Wudang Sect, the elders had endured the most hardship. Despite their constraints, they had searched the land for talented individuals and trained them relentlessly until they could rival any young master in the Jianghu. Their efforts were beyond words.

Having reaped the fruits of their labor, their pride was immeasurable.

The disciples who had manifested Sword Qi wore similar expressions.

It was pride.

“Sheathe swords!”

Shhk!

At Jinghae’s command, the disciples who had unleashed Sword Qi sheathed their blades in unison.

Jinghae’s face was flushed red.

This was the moment when the Wudang Sect would finally reappear. For this moment, he had endured decades of rigorous training.

Ever since he first held a sword at the tender age of three, he had never stopped practicing.

From a young age, he was recognized as a special talent, and many expected him to excel.

He never forgot what he learned and knew how to refine any martial art he mastered.

Because of this, the sect leader, Elder Cheongsong, personally taught him, and numerous elders imparted their insights.

He absorbed their teachings completely and gained entry into the pinnacle technique of Wudang swordsmanship: the Supreme Wisdom Sword.

Though his mastery was still shallow, no disciple in the last century had reached that level except for him.

Jinghae had devoted himself solely to the glory and revival of Wudang, and that had led to his current achievements.

The Wudang sect’s Gate Opening Ceremony had now concluded.

They had offered their prayers to the heavens, and the Wudang Sect was no longer a secluded sect.

Through this event, the Wudang Sect had flaunted its presence and achieved most of its goals. But the most crucial matter still remained.

Jinghae walked down the platform with his sword sheathed.

The crowd’s attention naturally focused on him.

They still didn’t know much about Jinghae.

Though he had defeated Po Cheonwol, the Green Forest Emperor and Lord of Sky High Castle, few were aware of it.

So no one knew how strong the man representing Wudang truly was.

The Wudang Sect needed a face to represent them.

And it would be all the better if that face belonged to a martial artist acknowledged as the best under heaven.

So Jinghae walked forward.

He walked over to where a certain man was sitting

Lee Gwak.

The most famous young martial artist in the current Jianghu.

He was the idol of countless young martial artists

The crowd watched Jinghae with curiosity. A few sharp-eyed individuals began to show signs of excitement.

Most of them had weathered countless battles in the Jianghu. Just by observing a person’s gaze, steps, and actions, they could easily discern their intentions.

Jinghae’s approach toward Lee Gwak resembled that of a tiger stalking prey.

Only a fool would fail to understand what that meant:

‘Could the Wudang Sect be targeting the Grandmaster Lee?’

‘Really?’

As the crowd’s curiosity peaked, Jinghae stopped in front of Lee Gwak.

Suddenly, Jinghae clasped his fists in a martial salute.

“Grandmaster Lee!”

“…….”

“I know this is presumptuous, but I have a request. Will you hear me out?”

“And what might that be?”

“Haha! Our sect has gone to great lengths to prepare this feast, yet I fear the excitement is lacking. Nothing stokes the flames of passion like a martial duel. Would you honor me with a match?”

“A duel?”

“I know it’s an impudent request. If you find it beneath you to spar with me, you may refuse. But I have no doubt that a man of your reputation would not turn down a humble junior like me.”

Jinghae had projected his voice with internal energy, so everyone nearby could hear clearly.

“That’s rude. Inviting someone as a guest and then challenging them to a duel?”

“How rude. To invite a guest and then challenge them to a duel?”

The first to react was not Lee Gwak but Mok Seon-wol.

Despite her sharp retort, Jinghae didn’t even blink.

“I know I’m being rude. That’s why I’m respectfully asking for his understanding.”

Jinghae’s gaze remained fixed on Lee Gwak.

A faint anger flickered in Mok Seon-wol’s eyes.

She turned to the other guests, intending to protest the Wudang Sect’s unfair conduct.

“This should be entertaining.”

“So the Wudang Sect is challenging the Sura Blade. That’s quite something.”

“I doubt the Sura Blade of Jianghu would refuse, right?”

The leaders of the Seven Sects were siding with Jinghae.

Only a few, including Mok Seon-wol, opposed his proposal.

A deep crease formed between Mok Seon-wol’s eyebrows.

She hadn’t expected the Wudang Sect to pressure Lee Gwak so openly.

Their approach was so blatant that she couldn’t find the words to object.

“Swordmaster Jinghae is challenging the Grandmaster Lee to a duel?”

“Heavens! What an unexpected turn of events!”

“Who do you think will win?”

The crowd had already begun murmuring.

As if orchestrated, the whispers that started in one corner soon spread like wildfire.

“Wooah!”

“It’s a duel between First Sword of Wudang Sect Jinghae and Grandmaster Lee!”

“The duel is about to begin!”

In an instant, excitement and frenzy swept through the crowd.

The heroes had already accepted the duel between Jinghae and Lee Gwak as a foregone conclusion and watched with eager eyes.

Refusal was not an option.

The heroes’ gazes were like daggers, pressuring Lee Gwak.

This was exactly the situation Jinghae and the Wudang Sect had wanted.

A few Wudang masters hung their heads in shame.

No matter how much this was for the sect’s sake, they knew this was not the right way. But they lacked the power to change the course of events.

Elder Cheongsong stared at Lee Gwak with a hardened expression.

Their next move depended on Lee Gwak’s response.

They had to get him onto the dueling platform by any means necessary.

If Jinghae defeated Lee Gwak, the Wudang Sect would instantly establish itself as a formidable force.

Jinghae had already defeated Po Cheon-wol, the Green Forest Emperor.

Elder Cheongsong was confident that Jinghae could defeat Lee Gwak as well—if only they could lure him onto the stage.

Beads of sweat formed on his palms.

That’s how nervous he was.

Jinghae infused his voice with internal energy once more.

“What is your answer? Will you accept my request?”

At that moment, Lee Gwak stood up from his seat.

The murmuring crowd instantly fell silent, and the vast Wudang martial arena was consumed by stillness.

Lee Gwak stared at Jinghae.

For a moment, Jinghae felt a sting in his eyes.

Lee Gwak’s gaze was ordinary. It didn’t gleam with divine light like other masters, nor was it so sharp it pierced one’s soul.

But it was heavy.

Unshaken.

That gaze weighed down on Jinghae’s entire body like a mountain.

For a moment, he felt short of breath and instinctively drew up his internal energy. He hadn’t expected to react so sensitively to a mere look.

Jinghae clenched his fists tightly.

He had already defeated one of the leaders of the Seven Sects, Po Cheon-wol. There was no reason to be intimidated by Lee Gwak.

Jinghae asked again.

“Will you accept my request, Grandmaster Lee?”

“…”

“Grandmaster Lee!”

“I accept your duel request.”

Finally, Lee Gwak spoke. But a bitter smile formed at the corners of his lips.

He had suspected it might come to this. But when that vague suspicion became reality, a sharp ache bloomed in his chest.

No matter how heartless the Jianghu may be, he had hoped that a prestigious sect like Wudang would be different.

However, the ideal and reality were different.

The Wudang Sect had taken an astoundingly shrewd approach: to elevate their prestige by having Jinghae defeat Lee Gwak before the eyes of the world.”

He didn’t want to condemn them.

Perhaps it was the best move they could make under the circumstances.

But he couldn’t suppress the fury rising from the depths of his heart.

Lee Gwak was human too.

He wanted to be treated with respect, not looked down upon.

And right now, Jinghae and Wudang’s actions were clearly mocking him. That’s what enraged him.

How insignificant must they think I am to pull such a scheme in front of all Jianghu?

Lee Gwak walked towards Jinghae.

Jinghae’s gaze hardened as he watched Lee Gwak approach.

Finally, Lee Gwak stopped right in front of him, close enough that they could feel each other’s breath.

Lee Gwak spoke in a voice so low the surrounding crowd couldn’t hear.

“I accept your challenge.”

“Thank you.”

“There’s no need to thank me.”

“What…?”

“Master Jinghae, you and the Wudang Sect will regret this decision for a very long time.”

“That’s a harsh thing to say, Grandmaster Lee!”

“The Wudang I knew was once a pillar of the Nine Sects—dignified, unwavering. It was a wise sect that chose the righteous path, even if it meant taking the long way around instead of shortcuts. I don’t know what has driven you and your sect to such desperation, but trying to use me as your stepping stone… I won’t let that slide.”

“I think you’re misunderstanding us. Our Wudang Sect never had such intentions.”

“Master Jinghae.”

“…”

“I’m not a fool. I’m not so naïve that I can’t recognize malice disguised as goodwill.”

“Gr… andmaster Lee”

“From the moment I received your invitation, I suspected something like this might happen. But I hoped I was wrong. I hoped Wudang would remain upright. I hoped you would build your reputation slowly and steadily, rather than sacrificing someone for quick glory. Because I believed that was the true path for Wudang. But now I see. My hopes were misplaced. The Wudang Sect today is no longer the Wudang of old.”

“Are you insulting Wudang right now? I don’t care if you insult me, but I won’t stand for anyone dishonoring the Wudang Sect!”

Jinghae snapped, raising his voice.

Shame flushed his face red—he hadn’t expected Lee Gwak to speak so bluntly.

Lee Gwak looked him directly in the eye and said:

“True insult is cloaking malice in false courtesy and forcing it upon others. As you have done here today.”
