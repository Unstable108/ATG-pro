Episode 2: A Small Leaf is Easily Shaken Even by the Faintest Wind (2)

Gwan Il-hyeon went back, leaving only Ja Hong-cheon and Joo Shin-yoon in the hall.

Ja Hong-cheons gaze remained fixed on the spot where Gwan Il-hyeon had been just moments before.

With an indifferent expression, Ja Hong-cheon murmured,

The young tiger seems to have grown bold.

Isnt such a thing typically normal at his age? They tend to be at the peak of their confidence, feeling as though they have the world at their feet.

Thats true!

At Joo Shin-yoons words, Ja Hong-cheon nodded slightly in agreement.

Ja Hong-cheon rested his chin on one hand and tapped the handle of his throne with the other. Knowing that this was a habit of Ja Hong-cheons when he was deep in thought, Joo Shin-yoon waited in silence.

The Jade Heaven Alliance is currently run by the Four Court Council.

The Inner Court, Outer Court, Main Court, and Secret Court these combined entities are responsible for driving the massive force that was the Jade Heaven Alliance. All important decisions within the Jade Heaven Alliance are made in consultation with the Four Court Council.

The first leader of the alliance believed that concentration of power inevitably led to corruption, hence this structure was established. However, this did not mean that the alliance leader was just a figurehead.

The leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance was, by mere existence, a focal point for the martial world and was publicly recognized as the best in the world. No matter how strong the power of the Four Court Council was, they couldnt deny the authority and presence of the alliance leader.

In particular, the current alliance leader, Ja Hong-cheon, without any particular background, had risen to the top of the Jade Heaven Alliance purely with his martial arts skills. But Ja Hong-cheon wasnt just strong in martial arts. He also excelled in governance, and his political acumen was unparalleled.

This political sense was precisely what made Joo Shin-yoon wary of Ja Hong-cheon. It was obvious that this was not something Ja Hong-cheon learned, but something he was born with. He had the innate ability to always find the best answer when making political decisions by relying on his instincts rather than his head.

Master Joo.

Ja Hong-cheons voice broke Joo Shin-yoons reverie.

Yes, alliance leader!

Is it confirmed that the Lunatic Pugilist has appeared again?

The Blue Dragon Squad has confirmed it.

Hmm! This is going to be a headache.

Indeed. With the Lunatic Pugilist resuming his activities again, there will likely be chaos in the martial world for the next six months at least.

Ja Hong-cheon frowned.

The Lunatic Pugilist.

He first emerged in the Jianghu about fifty years ago.

Just as his name suggested, he was a crazy old man. If he was simply mad, nobody would have ever talked about him, but he was strong, incredibly stronger than anyone could have imagined.

The first person he clashed with upon entering the martial world was a martial artist named Lee Cheong-san, known as the Death Shadow Swordsman. 2 Lee Cheong-san was a renowned swordsman with a cruel streak, hence the ominous nickname.

The encounter between the two happened purely by coincidence.

Lee Cheong-san, who was unhappy with the madmans behavior, was the first to initiate conflict. Up until that point, everyone believed that Lee Cheong-san would easily defeat the Lunatic Pugilist. However, against all expectations, the one who was defeated and lost his life was Lee Cheong-san.

With both of his legs broken and both arms torn off, Lee Cheong-san met a gruesome end. This incident both shocked and angered many. Thats why several martial artists stepped forward to seek vengeance on the Lunatic Pugilist.

However, all those who stepped up also met a brutal end at his hands.

The situation rapidly got worse and worse. Friends and acquaintances of those who had been killed by the Lunatic Pugilist sought revenge. But they, too, were brutally slain, and soon, the Lunatic Pugilist was designated as a public enemy of the martial world.

Many death squads were organized, and numerous martial artists hunted him down. Hundreds of martial artists set out to kill a single man alone. Among them were many martial artists who had reached the peak of their cultivation.

Everyone thought the Lunatic Pugilist would meet a terrible end. But the outcome was so shocking it stunned the entire martial world.

All of those hundreds of elite experts ended up being killed by the Lunatic Pugilist who was alone. It was a situation that no one could have ever imagined, so faced with this unimaginable event, the entire martial world shuddered in fear.

Eventually, as things grew out of proportion, the Jade Heaven Alliance decided to step forward.

The Jade Heaven Alliance unleashed its Net of Heaven and Earth 3 to suppress the Lunatic Pugilist. However, the Lunatic Pugilist managed to escape through the Jade Heaven Alliances Net of Heaven and Earth, greatly tarnishing the alliances honor.

After that, the Lunatic Pugilist disappeared from Jianghu.

It wasnt until many years later that he revealed himself to the world again, this time in the territory of the Celestial Demon Union, where he caused great trouble and became a target for retaliation. But once again, he managed to effortlessly escape the Celestial Demon Unions domain.

Numerous victims fell in the process.

Among the martial artists who attacked the Lunatic Pugilist, there was not a single person who wasnt a martial expert. Any expert pushed to this limit would, if not dead, have been severely injured. However, it was the Celestial Demon Union that suffered significant damage.

Among those killed by the Lunatic Pugilist was the second son of the former union leader. Enraged by his sons death, the former Celestial Demon Unions leader personally sought to kill the Lunatic Pugilist, but after that, the Lunatic Pugilist vanished and couldnt be found.

Since then, the Lunatic Pugilist revealed himself in Jianghu once every few years or once a decade and went on a rampage for six months. Every time he appeared, Jianghu was greatly disturbed. Thats why he was nicknamed the Lunatic Pugilist.

No one truly knew the identity of the Lunatic Pugilist. Whether it be his name, age, or sect However, one thing was certain the an old man who so crazy that he couldnt even remember his own name wast terrifyingly strong.

Even the Ten Great Supreme Masters, 4 the leaders of the Ten Supremes, or the Eight Great Martial Artists, 5 revered as the absolute best in the world, found it challenging to face him.

In fact, one of the martial artists who suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of the Lunatic Pugilist was one of the Eight Great Martial Artists, the Ghost Spirit Granny. Due to this incident, Ghost Spirit Granny had to go into hiding for several years to heal her injuries.

Afterwards, the Lunatic Pugilist was classified not as a human but as a disaster, recognized as an entity one should never provoke.

He had been silent for the recent decade, so everyone had forgotten about the Lunatic Pugilist. But now that he has returned to the world, the Jade Heaven Alliance had to take action.

I guess we have no choice but to comply with the demands of the Celestial Demon Union.

If we dont put in the effort to eliminate the Lunatic Pugilist for fear of damage to the Jade Heaven Alliance, well face heavy criticism.

Hes clever, bringing the Lunatic Pugilist into this.

Its clear theyve been preparing for a long time. Considering theyve identified the activities of the Lunatic Pugilist that hadnt been known.

Do you think we can suppress the Lunatic Pugilist without any losses?

Its impossible. Only the alliance leader or those at the level of the Ten Supremes can suppress him. Otherwise, we will only increase the damage.

But we cant just let him be, can we?

Its not something we can avoid. We have to make some sacrifices.

I dont like it. Weve worked so hard to build up our power, and now we have to take a hit.

The peaceful era cant last forever, can it? Since they provoked us first, we should use it to our advantage.

Ja Hong-cheons eyes turned cold.

A silence ensued. Joo Shin-yoon bowed his head, waiting for his orders. After a moment, he heard the voice he had been waiting for.

Joo, handle this matter yourself. And make sure theres no unnecessary noise.

Understood.

Joo Shin-yoon bowed deeply.

When he raised his head again, Ja Hong-cheons figure had already disappeared, nowhere to be seen.

Left alone, Joo Shin-yoon murmured to himself,

It seems like I need to establish connections with Dragon Sky Valley and Zealous Justice Sect to make sure that the Jade Heaven Alliance doesnt take the brunt of the damage.

Brother, what will become of us?

Lee Gwak couldnt easily answer Han Socheons question.

It had been over five days since Han Socheon and the children took shelter in the White Sage Pavilion, yet no decision had been made regarding them.

Although they had to live confined within the White Sage Pavilion, the children were treated well, which somewhat lessened their guard.

During this time, Lee Gwak had taken special care of Han Socheon. Among everyone, the only person Han Socheon could truly trust was Lee Gwak, so she relied on him almost blindly.

If Lee Gwak was out of sight for even a moment, Han Socheon would visibly become anxious. Therefore, Lee Gwak couldnt help but be even more attentive to her. However, there was a problem.

For the past few days, while guarding the White Sage Pavilion, he hadnt been able to meet Geum Yul-seon at all. He desperately wanted to see her, but he couldnt, which was frustrating.

It was then that he heard the voice he had been waiting for.

Another group will guard this place from now, so all of you can go home and rest.

It was Squad 13 leader Oh Guhong who had brought the good news.

A look of joy spread across Lee Gwaks face, not just at the prospect of returning home, but more so at the thought of seeing Geum Yul-seon again.

Upon hearing that Lee Gwak would leave his post, Han Socheons face became filled with worry. Lee Gwak tried to comfort her.

Ill visit whenever I have time, so dont worry and rest.

Of course!

Lee Gwak gave Han Socheon a reassuring smile. Only then did a smile also appear on her face.

After gazing at her for a moment, Lee Gwak exited the White Sage Pavilion. His steps were light and carefree as he left the place he had been for so long.

Han Socheon clasped her collar and continued to watch Lee Gwaks retreating figure. Even after he had disappeared from view outside the White Sage Pavilion, she found it hard to look away.

The first place Lee Gwak headed to after leaving the White Sage Pavilion was the Grand Abyss Music Hall. He went there with high hopes, but he couldnt find Geum Yul-seon.

This was because all the musicians in the Grand Abyss Music Hall have to be mobilized for a performance that day. In the end, Lee Gwak had no choice but to leave with a heavy heart.

The next day, Lee Gwak visited the White Sage Pavilion again to look after Han Socheon. However, neither Han Socheon nor the children were there, only the servants cleaning up.

When he asked the servants about Han Socheons whereabouts, they replied that some high-ranking individuals came the previous night and took all the children.

The servants had no idea who these high-ranking individuals were.

Lee Gwak let out a soft sigh. For some reason, he felt a heaviness in his heart. But there was nothing he could do about it here.

He didnt know why the higher-ups had taken the children, but he figured it couldnt be a bad thing. This was the domain of the Jade Heaven Alliance, a place created to uphold justice in Jianghu.

Lee Gwak returned to the accommodations of the Outer Hall.

Move quickly!

Hurry up and pack your stuff up!

Greeting Lee Gwak were the Outer Hall martial artists, bustling about. The sight of the martial artists frantically packing and inspecting their weapons was quite different from the usual.

Whats going on?

Oh, Gwak, youre back. Dont just stand there. Get ready to move out.

Gok Chae-bong responded, pausing from his weapon inspection.

Yes! The order was sent out a while ago. From Squad 8 to Squad 13, everyone is being deployed for a mission.

Lee Gwaks face stiffened.

From Squad 8 to Squad 13, that was half the entire force of the Outer Hall.

Since joining the Jade Heaven Alliance, there had never been an instance when half the force of the Outer Hall was dispatched at once.

What happened?

I dont know. When has the higher-ups ever explained their reasons for an order? Just go get ready quickly.

With his reply, Lee Gwak hurriedly began packing his things.

All he had prepared was a waist-length sword, an extra set of clothes, and some dry goods.

When youre all packed, gather in the training hall.

The commanding voices of the squad leaders could be heard outside.

Lee Gwak hurriedly slung his baggage over his shoulder and rushed to the training hall.

The training hall was already bustling with martial artists from the Outer Hall. The gathered Outer Hall martial artists, sorted by squads, had noticeably tense expressions.

Lee Gwak stood at the very front of Squad 13. Right next to him was Squad 12, where he could also see his only friend, Go Jeon-ok.

Oh, youre here.

Whats going on?

I dont know. The order just suddenly came out of nowhere.

Anyways, the atmosphere doesnt seem normal, so its best to be cautious. You take care of yourself.

You be careful too.

As Lee Gwak nodded in response to Go Jeon-oks words,

Everyone, be quiet.

A powerful and resonant voice echoed throughout the training hall.

Everyones gazes turned to the stage at the front. On the stage stood a middle-aged martial artist with a sturdy build reminiscent of a large chunk of rock.

With his piercing gaze and unyielding momentum, the middle-aged martial artist instantly dominated the atmosphere of the training hall.

Everyone held their breath as they looked at him.

That middle-aged martial artist was none other than Maeng Hee-cheon, the leader of the Outer Hall. He was the man who held the life and death power over the thirteen squads of the Outer Hall.

Raising his voice, Maeng Hee-cheon surveyed the martial artists of the Outer Hall,

You might have guessed this already, but we are about to embark on an important mission. It will be a long journey so ensure that none of you will fall behind. Your squad leader will fill you in on the details so standby for now.

As soon as Maeng Hee-cheons speech ended, squad leaders began gathering their members.

Squad 13 gathered around Oh Guhong.

The oldest of the group, Gok Chae-bong, asked first,

Group Leader, what is this all about?

Its not just the Outer Hall, but even the elites from the Main Court have been mobilized.

Then, its going to be dangerous.

Yes! The only good thing is that our Outer Hall is not directly involved in the fight. We would only be supporting the martial artists of the Main Court from the perimeter. But even then, its going to be very dangerous, so everyone should look after themselves. Understand?

The members of Squad 13 all replied at once.

They were nervous, but at least they were not directly involved in the mission.

Lee Gwak thought of Geum Yul-seon.

If I had known this was going to happen, I would have tried everything to see her face before leaving.

It left a bitter taste in his mouth.
