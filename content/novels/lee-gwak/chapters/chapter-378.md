There is a river in Lu’An where plum blossoms are abundant.

When spring arrives, the plum blossoms are in full bloom, spreading their rich fragrance and attracting countless poets and travelers to the area.

Although the season had changed and the petals of the plum blossoms had fallen long ago, the river still attracted a considerable number of visitors.

Apart from the plum blossoms, there wasn’t much else to see, and the scenery wasn’t particularly spectacular, but people came for one reason alone.

Bang Clan’s Inn.

Because there stood a guest house with a century-old tradition.

Most people in Lu’An knew that the cuisine at the Bang Clan’s Inn was unmatched, which is why many lined up to taste its food.

However, the opportunity to dine at the Bang Clan’s Inn was extremely limited. Its operating hours were short and there were only a few tables available.

Customers often pleaded for the guest house to expand and add more tables, but the owner always insisted that serving quality food to the guests was more important than increasing sales, and thus maintained the current size of the establishment.

Instead, he made no distinctions among his guests.

No matter how wealthy someone was, everyone received the same treatment at the Bang Clan’s inn. This was frustrating for the wealthy and those who considered themselves special, but no one dared to complain openly.

The Bang Clan’s Inn had been operating in Lu’An for over a century, and over that time, it had gained a loyal following.

Its regulars included influential martial artists as well as prominent families and officials in the region. Over a hundred years, the network of connections it had built was beyond imagination.

One martial artist even declared that attacking the Bang Clan’s Inn was like attacking him.

That man was none other than Namgung Jin-geom, the leader of the Thousand Kingdom School.

Since the leader of the Thousand Kingdom School himself had made such a declaration, no one dared to cause trouble at the Bang Clan’s Inn.

Chiiik!

Inside the kitchen of Bang Clan’s Inn, the heat was on and the sound of cooking filled the air.

Vegetables and oil were tossed into a searing hot wok, followed by carefully prepared pork, which was stir-fried in a flash. In moments, the nearly finished dish was seasoned, stir-fried again, and then plated.

The kitchen was filled with a mouthwatering aroma.

The middle-aged chef moved without pause, immediately starting on the next dish.

Tadadadak!

The knife in his hand diced the meat on the cutting board at a terrifying speed.

If a swordsman from the Jianghu had seen it, they would have marveled at his flawless blade work. The chef’s skill was on par with the greatest swordsmen of the jianghu.

In an instant, another dish was complete.

Despite the sweltering heat, not a single drop of sweat formed on his face. Though there were faint streaks of gray at his temples, he was still undeniably handsome—a mature man with striking features.

His name was Bang Ju-gwang, the current owner of the Bang Clan’s Inn.

Bang Ju-gwang swiftly finished five dishes and stepped outside.

It was usually a busy time, but strangely enough, there were no customers in the inn today. However, Bang Ju-gwang did not find this strange.

Today was a rare day off, the first in many years.

The regulars knew this, and the general public had been informed a few days in advance that the guest house would not be operating today.

Even on his rare day off, Bang Ju-gwang personally prepared food.

He carefully placed the dishes on the most modest table in the center of the guest house.

This humble table was made by Bang Jin-bo, the founder of Bang Clan’s Inn, and was one of the few heirlooms left in its original form. It held great significance in the guest house.

“Whew!”

Finally done with his work, Bang Ju-gwang sat down on a chair to rest.

Just then, an unexpected voice came from the entrance.

“Looks like I’m the first one here.”

A middle-aged man in green robes pushed open the door and stepped inside.

For a moment, Bang Ju-gwang felt as if the air in the inn had frozen. The man’s presence dominated the entire space.

He was like a finely honed sword.

Just standing there, he exuded an aura so sharp it could cut through steel.

Most martial artists would struggle to breathe in front of such pressure, but Bang Ju-gwang remained completely unfazed.

“Welcome, Brother. You’re the first to arrive.”

“Good! That means I won’t have to listen to any nagging.”

“Who would dare nag the Dark Heavenly Lone Star ?”

“Quite a few, actually.”

The middle-aged man smiled and sat down next to Bang Ju-gwang.

In all the world, there was only one man known by the title “Dark Heavenly Lone Star”.

Namgung Jin-geom.

The leader of the Thousand Kingdom School and one of the ten greatest martial artists under heaven.

The man in green robes was none other than Namgung Jin-geom himself.

Despite his imposing presence, Bang Ju-gwang wasn’t the least bit intimidated. Instead, he teased him with a smile.

“After always being late, you finally show up on time and make a big deal out of it.”

“When I come late, there’s never any food left. You should make it a little less delicious so there’s some to spare.”

“What can I do? I was taught to cook with all my heart.”

“Well, that’s the Bang Clan’s way. Hard to blame you for that. As expected, you’re still incredible today.”

Namgung Jin-geom swallowed hard as he looked at the dishes on the table.

Just as he absentmindedly reached for his chopsticks—

“Tsk! Aren’t we supposed to eat only after everyone’s arrived?”

A crisp voice rang out from behind him.

“Damn it!”

Namgung Jin-geom clicked his tongue and set the chopsticks back down.

He didn’t even need to turn around to know who it was.

An elderly man who appeared to be in his late fifties entered the inn.

“Welcome, Elder Po!”

Namgung Jin-geom stood to greet him.

Despite his age, the man had a striking, almost hawk-like intensity. He was Po Cheon-wol, the Green Forest Emperor.

The master of Sky High Castle and, like Namgung Jin-geom, one of the world’s supreme martial artists.

Namgung Jin-geom greeted him with a slightly grumpy expression, whereas Bang Ju-gwang welcomed him with a bright smile.

“It’s been a long time. I’m glad to see you still looking strong.”

“Strong? Ha! I’ve been laid up for nearly a year after being beaten by Ja Hong-cheon.”

“But you have recovered now, right?”

“Ha!”

Po Cheon-wol snorted, but his expression wasn’t completely displeased.

He naturally took the seat next to Bang Ju-gwang.

Two of the seven major figures had joined together.

Although the atmosphere could have been tense, Bang Ju-gwang still smiled comfortably.

Then another voice called out.

“I trust you’ve kept my place empty. Brother!”

Another person entered the guesthouse with a calm voice.

A man of average appearance, who could be seen anywhere, walked confidently into the guesthouse and sat down in an empty seat.

No one scolded him.

He, too, had every right to sit there.

Bang Ju-gwang greeted him with a composed expression.

“It’s been a while, brother!”

“It has been a while.”

The man waved at Bang Ju-gwang.

He then casually acknowledged Po Cheon-wol and Namgung Jin-geom.

“It’s been a long time since we met at the last gathering. Three years, right?”

“That sounds about right.”

“I heard times have been tough, but you seem to look better than expected.”

Po Cheon-wol and Namgung Jin-geom exchanged greetings with the man.

He drank the water on the table in one go, wiping his mouth on his sleeve before responding:

“Don’t even mention it. I don’t think there’s ever been a harder time than now. I don’t know where all these troublemakers keep coming from. Lately, I’ve been thinking of just quitting business altogether.”

“If the Merchant King is complaining like this, things must really be difficult.”

“Hmph! The Jade Heaven Alliance has been eyeing our wealth, and just when I was dealing with the Nine Dragons Clan, that bastard Sura Blade suddenly showed up and ruined everything. It’s exhausting. Truly exhausting!”

Po Cheon-wol had called the man the Merchant King.

In the Jianghu, there was only one man known by that title.

Eun Won-ho, the leader of the Myriad Merchant Troupe.

The true master of the Myriad Merchant Troupe—the wealthiest faction under heaven—had now appeared at the Bang Clan’s Inn.

Three of the Seven Supreme’ leaders had gathered in one place.

The tension in the air should have been overwhelming, but their expressions were as relaxed as if they had returned to their hometown.

In truth, they were no strangers to each other.

Though they had gone their separate ways now, they had been as close as family a hundred years ago.

The founder of the Bang Clan’s Inn, Fang Jin-bo, had married Eun So-cheong, the only daughter of the Eun Trading Company, which was among the “Ten Great Merchant Guilds” at that time, and they had two children.

The elder child inherited the Bang Clan’s Inn, while the younger took the Eun surname to carry on the Eun Family.

The Eun Family eventually became the Myriad Merchant Troupe, now the greatest trading group in the land.

And that was not all. The thousand Kingdom school had similarly deep ties with the Bang Clan’s Inn

Namgung Yeong-hwi and Namgung Seon-hwi were the last survivors of the Namgung clan after the Great Heavenly Blood War. They founded the Thousand Kingdom School on the land of the Namgung clan.

Together with the surviving descendants of the Jegal clan, the Hwangbo clan, and the Pang family of Hebei, they formed the Thousand Kingdom School.

What united these three entities – the Bang Family Inn, the Myriad Merchant Group, and the Thousand Kingdom School – was Dam Ho, the greatest of his time a hundred years ago.

Also known as the “Fist Demon of Mount Hua”.

Though his fame had faded over time and few people now remembered him, veteran martial artists still recalled him vividly.

They remembered the terror he instilled with his two fists alone.

The Sky High Castle had been founded by Dan Ho’s younger sister and her husband, who had united the scattered remnants of the Green Forest Bandits.

For this reason, the leaders of these three sects met regularly at the Bang Clan’s Inn.

They met once every few years to share a meal and catch up.

Today was such a gathering.

Under normal circumstances, it would have been a joyful occasion. However, given the current state of affairs, the three men gathered in the guest house did not have particularly bright expressions.

Bang Ju-gwang tried to dispel the heavy atmosphere with a bright laugh.

“Haha! For today’s gathering, I’ve prepared some special dishes from our inn’s secret recipes. Just one bite and you’ll all live long and prosperous lives.”

“Then of course I’ll have to eat. Even if I can’t live for ten thousand years, living for a thousand years would be nice.”

Namgung Jin-geom joked as he picked up his chopsticks. But Bang Ju-gwangstopped him.

“Wait a moment.”

“What’s the matter?”

“We should have a drink before eating. My daughter brewed this wine herself—it’s excellent.”

“Come to think of it, I don’t see Ye-in around. Where is she?”

“I thought she’d be back by now, but it seems she’s running late.”

“Hmph! I wonder who she takes after, wandering around like that.”

“Well, at least her cooking skills are solid. She won’t starve out there. Haha!”

Namgung Jin-geom smiled faintly at Bang Ju-gwang’s words.

He adored Bang Ye-in as if she were his own daughter. She was that kind of person—warm and endearing.

At the mention of Bang Ye-in, Po Cheon-wol and Eun Won-ho also smiled. She was dearly loved by all of them.

Po Cheon-wol asked,

“Ye-in brews an incredible wine, doesn’t she?”

“You remember well. She’s surpassed me now—not just in cooking, but in brewing too.”

“That’s something to look forward to.”

Po Cheon Wol rubbed his hands together.

No one laughed at him for it.

Both Eun Won-ho and Namgung Jin-geom knew just how skilled Bang Ye-in was.

Bang Ju-gwang poured the wine she had brewed into their cups.

“Hoh!”

“The aroma is incredible.”

“Good! Very good!”

The three men exhaled in admiration at the same time.

Even though, as leaders of major sects, they had tasted all the finest delicacies and wines under heaven, but this fragrance was intoxicating enough to make their minds go blank.

“A toast!”

Clink!

They clinked their cups and drank.

Expressions of wonder rose on their faces.

The taste exceeded their expectations.

Smiles naturally formed at the corners of their mouths.

After drinking Bang Ye-in’s wine, they began sampling the dishes on the table.

Chopsticks busily flew across the table.

“I’ve never had this dish before.”

“Ah! It’s a new recipe I tried this time. How is it?”

“Do I really have to say it? Damn it! It’s ridiculously good.”

Po Cheon-wol grumbled as he ate with relish.

Namgung Jin-geom and Eun Won-ho were the same. But Namgung Jin’s expression wasn’t as bright as theirs.

This gathering had been held for a hundred years.

Bang Ju-gwang had been hosting it for decades, but never before had the atmosphere been so heavy.

Everyone was forcing a cheerful expression on their faces, but underneath, there was a dark tension.

Po Cheon Wol’s status had declined since his defeat at the hands of Ja Hong Cheon, and Eun Won-ho had been forced to abandon key strongholds of the Myriad Merchant Troupe, operating in secrecy underground. Naturally, they weren’t in high spirits.

The Thousand Kingdom School wasn’t much better either.

A massive amount of funds had been drained dealing with the aftermath of the Great Soho fire, caused by Go jeon-ok.

All three sects were going through dark times.

Even though they had gathered as tradition dictated, none of them were truly at ease.

Bang Ju-gwang, as the host, felt the same.

Though he lived detached from the Jianghu, his roots were deeply entwined with it.

“Sigh…”

Just as Bang Ju-gwang unconsciously let out a deep sigh—

“Namu Amitabha!”

A voice infused with tremendours internal energy boomed from outside.
