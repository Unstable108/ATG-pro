Lee Gwak suddenly raised his head to look at the sky.

A pitch-black darkness, devoid of any starlight, seemed to swirl around him. Although it wasn’t actually happening, that’s how it appeared to Lee Gwak.

He glared at the sky with furrowed brows.

Something was happening.

He couldn’t tell what it was, but Lee Gwak’s instincts were whispering to him.

Sometimes, these vague, unfounded intuitions can be more accurate than information gathered by many people.

Especially for a highly skilled martial artist like Lee Gwak, whose instincts were as sharp as a blade and as precise as an awl, often piercing the truth unconsciously.

Lee Gwak couldn’t take his eyes off the restless night sky.

Seeing his expression—like someone glaring at a mortal enemy—made Lee Cheong feel slightly uneasy.

It was the first time he had seen his father like this.

“Dad! What’s wrong?”

Lee Cheong’s voice brought Lee Gwak back to his senses.

“It’s nothing. I’m just feeling a bit uneasy.”

He hastily gave a vague excuse.

Lee Gwak hastily mumbled an excuse.

Despite his reassurance, Lee Cheong couldn’t shake his anxious expression. Only then did Lee

Gwak realized his mistake.

“I’m sorry! I made you anxious.”

“Your expression earlier was really scary.”

“Was it?”

“Yes! It was like you were staring down a life-or-death enemy.”

“I’m sorry. It won’t happen again.”

As Lee Gwak gently stroked his head, Lee Cheong’s anxious expression finally faded.

Lee Gwak sighed softly and clenched and unclenched his fists.

He had gripped it so tightly that his entire hand had gone numb from the lack of circulation of blood

He held his arm over the fire.

The warmth restored his numb arm.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong were on an unnamed mountain.

They had been riding hard all day. They wanted to keep moving at night, but their horse were too exhausted, so they had no choice but to camp out.

Lee Cheong looked at Lee Gwak.

“Dad, do you think Mom and Sister are okay?”

“They’ll be fine.”

Lee Gwak replied firmly, and Lee Cheong’s eyes finally steadied from their uneasy flutter.

“As you know, your mom has a lot of experience in Jianghu. If we’re talking about experience alone, she could be considered a veteran. No matter the crisis, she and Soo-ah can look after themselves.”

“Right. And Soo-ah isn’t ordinary either.”

“Yes! Soo-ah is very clever, so she’ll manage even if a crisis hits.”

“I just hope she doesn’t get into any kind of trouble…”

Now that he was feeling somewhat relieved, Lee Cheong began to worry about Lee Soo-ah’s unpredictable nature.

Seeing this, Lee Gwak stretched out his hand and patted him on the head.

“Soo-ah might be unpredictable, but she has clear judgment. Don’t worry too much.”

“Really?”

“Of course!”

“Ah! I miss my mom and sister.”

Placing his hands behind his head, Lee Cheong leaned against a rock.

A faint smile curved on Lee Gwak’s lips.

Both Lee Soo-ah and Lee Cheong were still children who needed their parents’ care. Yet instead of whining, they were doing their best to think positively.

He was proud of them.

Suddenly, Lee Gwak reached down and picked up the blade that was lying on the ground.

Swoosh!

As he drew it from its sheath, the silvery blade came into view. The glow of the campfire danced across its surface in glittering fragments. However, Lee Gwak’s expression remained grim as he studied the blade.

The edge had several gaps, reminiscent of a saw blade, and there were also tiny cracks across the blade, suggesting it was worn out.

“Phew!”

He sighed.

His blade was simply a mass-produced weapon from a local smithy. Naturally, it couldn’t compare to something crafted by a renowned artisan. Yet even so, its hardness was disappointingly low.

It wasn’t as though he needed a divine weapon, but it would be nice to have a blade sturdy enough to withstand a fair amount of wear and tear.

“I should buy a new blade when I get the chance.”

Even though Lee Gwak had reached a level where he could perform blade techniques without a blade, having a sword in hand was advantageous when facing an opponent of similar skill.

Thud!

Lee Gwak put the sword back in its sheath.

Meanwhile, Lee Cheong had fallen asleep, breathing evenly with his eyes closed.

Lee Gwak took off his outer robe and covered Lee Cheong with it. Feeling the warmth, Lee Cheong smiled in his sleep.

Lee Gwak spent a long time looking at Lee Cheong’s face.

His small features clearly mirrored his own. Lee Gwak couldn’t take his eyes off Lee Cheong for a while.

Finally, after gently touching Lee Cheong’s face, Lee Gwak lay down to sleep.

They woke up before dawn.

Lee Cheong woke up first and nudged Lee Gwak.

“Dad! Wake up. We need to get going.”

“Right!”

Refreshed from a good night’s sleep, Lee Cheong’s face was full of vitality.

The horses, having rested, looked lively as well.

Lee Gwak was relieved and started loading their gear onto the horses.

There was no time for a proper meal, so they each took a piece of jerky to eat while riding.

“Let’s go!”

“Yes!”

They mounted their horses and set off immediately.

They quickly left the mountain and entered the main road.

There were people moving along the road.

Normally, they would have slowed down to avoid inconveniencing others. But now, they couldn’t afford such courtesy.

Without slowing their horses, they weaved through the crowd, almost acrobatically.

“Whoa!”

“What the?”

Startled people cursed at them.

‘Sorry.’

Lee Cheong apologized in his heart, but he didn’t slow down.

He was too anxious to delay.

After leaving the mountain and riding for almost half a day, they arrived at Qianjiang.

They had left the region of Donghu’s Akju only three days ago, and under normal circumstances, it would have taken at least five days to get here, even riding at full speed. By covering the distance in three days, they had effectively gained two days over a typical journey.

Prrr!

As they entered the city, their horse neighed tiredly.

Both of them patted the horse’s neck to calm it.

Lee Gwak glanced around, searching for the local branch of the Hao Clan.

As Lee Gwak guessed the location of the Hao Clan’s branch and headed there, a Hao Clan member approached them first.

“Are you Lee Gwak?”

“Yes, I am.”

“I am Goyeop, the branch leader of the Hao Clan in Qianjiang. I am honored to meet you.”

Goyeop greeted him politely with cupped hands.

Dismounting from his horse, Lee Gwak spoke.

“How did you recognize me?”

“Your description was sent to all our branches. Also, you’re traveling with your son, so there was no mistaking you.”

Furthermore, the news that Lee Gwak had become a guest of the Hao clan had spread to all the branches of the Hao clan.

It was the first time in the history of the Hao Clan that someone had been made a guest, so the branch leaders were keenly watching his movements.

That meant, wherever a Hao Clan outpost existed, they would be alerted the instant Lee Gwak entered the area.

He asked Goyeop,

“Have you heard any news?”

“Actually, I came to find you because of that.”

“And?”

“We have found traces of your wife and daughter.”

“Really?”

“It needs further verification, but we received information that a mother and daughter resembling your wife and daughter were seen near Hansan Town.”

“Hansan Town?”

Lee Gwak frowned.

If Han So-cheon and Lee Soo-ah had started from Mt. Qilian and reached Hansan Town, it meant they had moved unusually fast.

“Are they being pursued?”

“We haven’t been able to confirm that yet.”

Goyeop looked apologetic.

The witness was one of the lowest-ranking members of the Hao Clan. He hadn’t paid much attention when he first saw them because no specific orders had been given at that time.

It was only after orders were issued to track down the two women that he remembered seeing Han So-cheon and Lee Soo-ah and reported it.

Relief washed over Lee Gwak’s face.

At least it seemed the two were still safe for the time being.

“The branches in that area are mobilizing to find your wife and daughter, so we should have good news soon.”

“Thank you for your efforts.”

“Isn’t Master Lee the esteemed guest of our sect? There’s no need to thank me; it’s only natural.”

Goyeop shook his head.

Lee Gwak was no longer an outsider.

Although he was a guest, he was as significant as any major figure of the Hao Clan.

Nam Woo-gyeong had already sent messengers to all branches, instructing them to assist Lee Gwak with all their might.

That is why all Hao Clan branches were moving in coordination.

Goyeop pointed to the dock.

“From now on, it would be much faster to travel by boat. I have prepared one, so please board at once.”

“Thank you.”

“I sincerely hope you find your wife and daughter safe and sound.”

“I will never forget Branch Leader Goyeop’s efforts.”

After Lee Gwak gave a martial salute to Goyeop, they moved to the dock. Lee Cheong also thanked Goyeop.

“I will never forget this kindness.”

“Ha ha!”

Goyeop laughed heartily at Lee Cheong’s earnest thanks.

Like father, like son, he thought.

Goyeop returned the salute.

“I pray for your son’s journey to be safe.”

“Thank you.”

Lee Cheong nodded and boarded the boat.

The boat was not a typical flat-bottomed riverboat but a speedboat, prepared by Goyeop considering the gravity of the situation. It was large enough to carry the two people and their horses that had accompanied them.

As soon as Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong boarded, the boat started moving quickly.

Only then could the two of them breathe a sigh of relief.

“Phew!”

Once on the boat, there was nothing more they could do.

Lee Gwak told Lee Cheong,

“Take some rest now. We’ll have to rush again once we disembark.”

“Yes!”

Lee Cheong nodded, sat cross-legged, and began circulating his internal energy.

While watching over Lee Cheong as he practiced, Lee Gwak looked around.

Indeed, being a swift boat, it sailed much faster than any other vessels.

The scenery and other boats flew by at a frightening speed.

Even though they were moving fast, Lee Gwak wished they could go faster. At least it was comforting to know that Han So-cheon and Lee Soo-ah seemed safe.

Under normal circumstances, there was no reason for them to travel south so swiftly unless they were evading someone’s pursuit.

‘Who could it be?’

Lee Gwak’s eyes sharpened.

He and Han So-cheon had been in seclusion for almost three years.

While he had recently become well-known again in the Jianghu, Han So-cheon had been forgotten. If someone had gone out of their way to attack her, it was certainly tied to past grievances.

The problem was that he couldn’t pinpoint who it might be.

“Huh!”

A sigh escaped through Lee Gwak’s lips.

In the past, Han So-cheon had worked as an assassin, taking countless lives.

It wouldn’t be surprising if a family member of one of her victims was now seeking vengeance.

‘If that’s the case, it’s another debt she must pay.’

Lee Gwak reflected on how terrifying the grudges of the Jianghu could be.

No matter how many times you cut them off, they cling to you again, insisting you repay the debt.

Not only Han So-cheon, but also Lee Gwak himself could not be free from these old resentments.

Someone he didn’t even know about might be out there harboring hatred against him.

To be unable to escape from grudges was, perhaps, the fate of those who lived in the Jianghu.

Even though he understood that, he still couldn’t help feeling bitter.

Lee Gwak shook his head, trying to drive away those thoughts.

At that moment, Lee Cheong awakened from his cultivation.

“Dad!”

“How do you feel?”

“I feel great.”

“Really?”

“Yes!”

Lee Cheong answered with vigor.

His face was brimming with vitality.

Maybe because of his youth, his recovery was noticeably swift.

Knowing that Han So-cheon and Lee Soo-ah were safe had lifted his spirits.

It was just as Lee Gwak was smiling at his son that the boat captain called out to him.

“Master Lee!”

Lee Gwak turned in the direction the captain was pointing, and his expression stiffened.

Off in the distance, more than ten ships were blocking the waterway.

They were arranged like a barricade of vessels.

Among them, the largest ship bore a waving flag atop its mast.

On the triangular banner, three characters were embroidered with golden thread.

“Green… …Heaven…. Society?”
