“Hah!”

Seok Yi Cheon let out a sigh.

In front of him was a massive warehouse with its doors wide open, revealing mountains of treasure piled inside.

The sheer scale left him speechless.

“This is insane…”

In the end, he gave up trying to comprehend it.

His mind couldn’t comprehend how many people’s blood had been squeezed out to make this much.

“Huu…”

Even Lee Gwak exhaled deeply.

Despite having experienced countless battles, this was the first time he had witnessed such a spectacle.

Seok Yi cheon turned to Lee Gwak and asked,

“What do you plan to do with all this wealth?”

“Return it to whoever we can.”

“There’ll still be a lot left…”

“We’ll give back as much as we can, and if there’s still some left over, we’ll keep it and figure out what to do with it.”

“Tsk. These bastards… No matter how blinded they were by greed, how could they exploit so many people to this extent?”

“Indeed.”

Lee Gwak nodded solemnly.

Though they had suddenly come into an unimaginable fortune, Lee Gwak felt no joy. He knew every coin here was stained with someone’s blood and tears.

Lee Gwak turned and gazed at the now-empty Heavenly Fate Sect.

With the death of Cheon-un-ja, the fanatics had scattered in all directions.

But Lee Gwak hadn’t let them go unscathed.

He shattered the dantians of Cheon-un-ja’s disciples and anyone with strong martial arts skills, rendering them powerless.

Those with broken dantians became cripples.

They would never again be able to wreak havoc on others.

Although Lee Gwak wished he could have killed each and every one of them, the world wasn’t that simple.

As he surveyed the now-abandoned Heavenly Fate Sect, Lee Gwak muttered to himself,

“A fortress like this, perfectly suited for seclusion and growth, was wasted in the hands of the wrong master.”

Then, an idea flashed through his mind.

Lee Gwak calmly scanned Heuksu.

A vision began to form in his thoughts.

Seok Yi-cheon watched him with eager anticipation.

“Are you thinking of…?”

“Yes. I will establish the Mad Martial Sect here.”

So far, Mad Martial Sect consisted only of the absolute master Lee Gwak, the genius strategist Lim Sobo, and Seok Yi-cheon.

It could hardly be called a proper sect.

To establish themselves as a true sect, they needed disciples and a base — and this place had everything they needed.

Lee Gwak reached down and picked up a handful of dirt.

The soil crumbled in his hand.

This land, which had endured years of disgrace under the Heavenly Fate Sect, would now be reborn in Lee Gwak’s hands.

He spoke to Seok Yi-cheon,

“Brother”

“Yes?”

“Send a message to So-bo through the Hao Clan. Inform her of the situation here and my intentions. She’ll know what to do.”

“Understood.”

Seok Yi-cheon nodded.

After a brief hesitation, he cautiously asked,

“Can I call the kids from the Outer Hall?”

“If they want to come, let them.”

“Hehe! They’ll definitely come. They all like you.”

“But don’t force them. They must come of their own free will.”

“Of course.”

“Oh, and please let my wife know I’m here. She doesn’t know I’ve settled here yet.”

“Understood. I’ll handle it while I’m at the Hao Clan.”

Seok Yi-cheon now considered himself Lee Gwak’s loyal subordinate.

Though he wasn’t much help in battle, he tried his best to take care of all the minor tasks for Lee Gwak.

“Thank you, Brother.”

“No need to thank me. Anyway, we need people to help clean up this mess.”

Seok Yi-cheon clicked his tongue as he looked around.

The aftermath of the intense battle was still visible everywhere.

Particularly where Lee Gwak had unleashed his Blood Storm, the devastation was unmistakable.

Erasing the remnants of the Heavenly Fate Sect and starting anew would require the efforts of many.

Just then—

“Huh? It’s snowing.”

Seok Yi Cheon, feeling a sudden chill, looked up at the sky and shouted.

As if to wipe away the Heavenly Fate Sect’s existence, white snow began to pour from the heavens

That winter brought unusually heavy snowfall and unprecedented cold.

The harsh conditions forced people to stay indoors. Everyone had to endure a brutal winter cooped up in their homes.

The Jianghu was no different.

No matter how powerful the sects — be it the Jade Heaven Alliance or the Seven Sects— they were still human organizations at their core.

No martial artist could overcome nature’s fury. Waging war in such cold was impossible.

So, the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Seven Sects halted all activities and focused on surviving the winter.

Ironically, this brought peace to the Jianghu.

Peace brought by snow.

Many people wished the winter would last longer.

Despite the hardships, at least they didn’t have to worry about dying from stray blades.

But as always, winter was quietly coming to an end.

Though snow still covered the land, it would melt with the coming spring. And the sects, dormant from the cold, would stretch their limbs and rise again.

“Whew…”

A mysterious woman pulled down the scarf that had wrapped her face and looked around.

White breath escaped her red lips, like a protest that winter wasn’t quite over.

The snowy landscape filled her vision. While most people would only think “white” or “cold,” she could see the true nature hidden beneath the snow.

“Surrounded by mountains, with only one entrance by land and water… There’s no better place to build strength in secret. I see why my Gwak oraboni chose this place.”

“This is Heuksu, right?”

The large man behind her also lowered his face cover and asked.

She smiled warmly and replied,

“Yes!”

“So my brother is staying here”

The man’s eyes lit up with anticipation.

“Honestly, this place is far better than the ruins of the Zealous Justice Clan. A natural fortress where one martial artist can hold off a thousand enemies isn’t easy to find. It’s perfect for the Mad Martial Sect while it’s still weak.”

The woman, who spoke with satisfaction, was Lim Sobo. The man following her was Cheol Gwan-woo.

Behind them were several hundred people, including Cheon Wol.

Their eyes, as they looked upon Heuksu, were filled with both anticipation and wariness.

They were the strategists and martial artists of Secret Court.

The Secret Court was the only place in the Jade Heaven Alliance that Ja Hong-cheon hadn’t taken over.

The strategists of the Secret Court had only ever truly followed one person—Yeo Jung-wol.

His death had caused a massive uproar.

Ja Hong-cheon claimed that he had died of illness, but few of the Secret Court’s strategists believed him.

The Secret Garden was home to the brightest minds in the land. Their ability to gather information and analyze situations was unmatched.

It was impossible for them to accept Ja Hong-cheon’s excuse. Some secretly investigated and eventually uncovered the truth—that Yeo Jung-wol had been killed while escaping the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Instead of reacting with blind rage, the strategists calmly prepared.

That’s when Lim So-bo secretly contacted them.

The Jade Heaven Alliance had closed its doors and cut off external contact during the winter. But Lim Sobo, who knew every secret passage, couldn’t be stopped.

She met with the strategists she had been close to and persuaded them.

No one else could have convinced them — but she was Yeo Jung-wol’s only disciple.

Everyone in the Secret Court loved her — as a daughter, a niece, or more.

Lim Sobo spoke with them at length.

She shared her master’s final wishes, her own resolve, and her honest thoughts on the current situation.

In the end, many decided to join her.

They, too, had sensed the corruption in the Jade Heaven Alliance. They could no longer watch their beloved Jade Heaven Alliance plunge the world into ruin.

So, strategists and martial artists who sided with Lim Sobo escaped through secret paths.

The Jade Heaven Alliance realized they were gone only a day later. Although they sent out a pursuit team, Lim Sobo was able to evade them with the help of the Hao Clan.

That winter, the snowfall was particularly heavy. Even small roads were buried waist-deep.

That’s why it took them so long to reach Heuksu – they left in the middle of winter and arrived at the end of winter.

Despite the exhaustion from the long journey, the group’s eyes sparkled with anticipation at the new place.

Cheol Gwang-woo took out a firework and shot it into the sky.

Boom!

A beautiful firework bloomed overhead.

Moments later, a large boat appeared from upstream. It headed straight toward Lim Sobo and Cheol Gwang-woo’s group.

At its bow, a familiar man waved vigorously.

Smiles appeared on the faces of Lim Sobo and Cheol Gwang-woo.

“Oraboni!”

“Big bro!”

Although they couldn’t hear him due to the distance, they could clearly feel Seok Yi-cheon’s warm welcome.

As the boat docked, a ramp came down and Seok Yi-cheon was the first to step off.

“Haha! Welcome. It must have been a harsh journey!”

“Not at all. But your face looks rough. You’ve been through a lot, haven’t you?”

“Don’t even ask.”

“What happened?”

“You’ll see when you get inside.”

Lim Sobo looked puzzled at his answer.

Cheol Gwang-woo, scanning the area, asked,

“Where’s big brother?”

“Inside.”

“Inside?”

“Just get on the boat. You’ll understand once we arrive.”

“Got it.”

Cheol Gwang-woo nodded and turned to the strategists and martial artists behind him.

“Everyone, board the boat.”

At his command, they entered onto the boat in an orderly manner.

Once everyone was aboard, the boat began its journey back upstream.

After a while, the terrain narrowed, surrounded by mountains – the secluded location of the former Heavenly Fate Sect appeared.

The once-gloomy sect had been completely transformed, now radiating a bright and lively atmosphere.

One of the most noticeable changes was the new plaque above the main gate.

Adorned with bold characters, it read: Mad Martial Sect.

“Mad… Martial Sect.”

Lim So-bo stared intently at the plaque.

A smile tugged at her lips.

She could sense Lee Gwak’s unwavering resolve in those three words.

Seok Yi-cheon led the way.

“Come on, let’s head inside.”

He guided them through the gates.

Beyond the entrance, the first thing they saw was a massive training ground.

The newcomers naturally expected to see martial artists training there. Instead, they found children playing.

Their ages ranged from around five or six to late teens. The younger ones ran around wildly, while the older kids chased after them, drenched in sweat.

Lim So-bo blinked in surprise.

“What’s going on here?”

“Well, you see…”

Seok Yi-cheon explained what had happened during the winter.

While the Heavenly Fate Sect had flourished, it had left countless orphans in its wake. Lee Gwak had taken in all the children who had lost their parents to the sect’s atrocities.

The number of rescued children exceeded three hundred.

Lee Gwak provided them shelter and hired caretakers.

“So these are the children you took in over the winter?”

“It just sort of happened.”

“It’s a good move. Building goodwill is important. Though I doubt Oraboni planned it that way.”

“Of course not. Gwak isn’t that calculating.”

“Where is he?”

“Probably overseeing the children’s martial training right now.”

“He’s teaching them?”

“According to him, a few of the kids have exceptional talent. He’s been training them for months now.”

“Interesting. If Oraboni says they’re talented, they must be something.”

Lim So-bo’s eyes sparkled with curiosity.

Having sworn to serve as Lee Gwak’s strategist, she was naturally intrigued by the disciples he had chosen.

Just then—

“You’re here.”

Lee Gwak appeared at the entrance of the training ground.

“Ora… boni!”

Lim Sobo smiled brightly as if she’d run into his arms at any moment — but suddenly stopped herself.

As Lee Gwak tilted his head in confusion, she clasped her fists and declared loudly,

“Strategist Lim So-bo greets the Sect Leader!”

Her clear voice echoed throughout the Mad Martial Sect.

The strategists and martial artists behind her also bowed and shouted,

“We greet the Sect Leader!”

A unified roar filled the sky of the Mad Martial Sect.
