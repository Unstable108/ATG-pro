“Dad, take care!”

Lee Soo-ah hugged Lee Gwak tightly around the neck.

Lee Gwak gently patted her back and asked, “Aren’t you sad you can’t come with me?”

“I am sad!”

“Really?”

“I’m joking. I’m letting Cheong go this time. I’ve been to many places, but Cheong hasn’t really seen the world.”

“How kind of you!”

“I let him go this time, but next time it’s my turn. You have to go with me then, okay?”

“Alright. I promise.”

At his response, Soo-ah hugged him tightly once more.

A little later, Lee Gwak gently pulled Soo-ah away and stood up.

Han So-cheon was holding Lee Cheong’s hand, waiting nearby. She handed Cheong’s hand over to Lee Gwak.

“Be careful. Listen to Dad, okay?”

“Okay!” Cheong answered enthusiastically.

Han So-cheon watched Cheong for a moment, then turned her gaze to Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak was wearing the cloak Han So-cheon had made for him. The leather garment suited him perfectly.

“Take care, Oraboni.”

“I won’t keep you waiting long.”

“Okay.”

Han So-cheon nodded, and Lee Gwak hugged her briefly.

With her eyes closed, she soaked in his warmth.

After a moment, Lee Gwak pulled away and said, “We’re off.”

“Okay.”

Lee Gwak turned around with Cheong by his side.

Father and son left Mount Gireon together.

Mother and daughter watched the two figures as they moved away.

When they finally disappeared beyond Bear Rock, Lee Soo-ah grumbled, “They could at least look back once. Hmph! So cold…”

Her eyes brimmed with tears.

Han So-cheon held her small hand tightly.

Lee Gwak and Cheong walked swiftly down the path.

Although Mount Giryeon [a] appeared gentle from the outside, it was actually very high and rugged. It took an entire day just to descend.

Even after leaving the mountain, it wasn’t as if they immediately reached a village. Another full day of walking was required to reach a town where people lived.

The town they arrived at was called Jucheon. Jucheon was located near Jiayuguan, the gateway to the outer regions.

Merchants passing through to the outer territories and those entering the Jianghu always stopped by Jucheon to make their preparations.

As a result, Jucheon was always bustling with people.

Merchants heading to the outer regions, martial artists escorting them, bodyguards from escort agencies—all mingled to create a lively atmosphere.

Lee Cheong looked around Jucheon with curious eyes.

Although he had read many books and knew a lot, reading about something and seeing it with his own eyes were entirely different experiences.

“Wow!”

Cheong exclaimed without even realizing it.

A foreign scene unfolded before his eyes.

Foreigners with blue eyes or dark black skin casually strolled the streets, and strange animals with humps on their backs grazed.

“Those are camels.”

He knew from books that such animals existed, but seeing them in person was entirely different. It was all the more fascinating.

For the first time, the usually composed Cheong had the expression of a curious child.

With a smile, Lee Gwak said to Cheong, “Let’s get our supplies here.”

“Supplies?”

“Yes! We’ll get a sword, and some horses.”

Since they had lived in the mountains, they hadn’t felt the need for swords. A small hatchet had been sufficient for their daily needs. But now that they were entering the Jianghu, they would need at least one sword.

Lee Gwak headed towards a weapon shop.

Finding a weapon shop wasn’t difficult.

Since many merchants and martial artists passed through, shops catering to them were plentiful.

Lee Gwak entered one that looked decent.

Inside, a variety of weapons were on display.

From typical swords to curved blades, spears, axes, and even bizarre foreign weapons, the selection was vast.

Passing by all the other weapons, Lee Gwak went directly to the display where the blades were gathered.

“Choose one.”

“Me?”

“Pick the blade you’ll use.”

“Me?”

Cheong looked at Lee Gwak in surprise.

“Your father’s martial art is based on bladesmanship. So, you should use a blade too.”

“It’s not that… Are you sure I can choose? Won’t you pick it for me?”

“It’s your blade, so it should suit you. Go on, pick one.”

“Hm.”

Nodding at his father’s words, Cheong carefully examined each blade on the rack.

Some were too heavy, others too light. Some were too long, and others too short.

He swung a few blades, carefully considering each one.

Lee Gwak watched silently, not interfering with Cheong’s selection.

Although Lee Gwak could have easily chosen a blade for him, he wanted Cheong to select his first weapon on his own.

No matter how one dressed it up, a blade was a lethal weapon designed to kill. Because it could take a life, he wanted his son to feel the responsibility and weight that came with choosing it.

After a long time, Cheong finally chose a blade that seemed to fit him best. It was a small blade suited to his small frame.

“I’ll take this one.”

Cheong showed the blade to Lee Gwak, who took it and inspected it carefully.

“Good-quality steel. The weight is just right, and the balance is well-maintained. You’ve chosen a good blade.”

“Really?”

“Yes! Take care of it.”

“Okay!”

Cheong’s face lit up with joy at his father’s praise.

Now, it was Lee Gwak’s turn to choose a blade .

Unlike Cheong, Lee Gwak quickly made his choice. He had already noted the blade he wanted while Cheong was choosing his.

Lee Gwak’s choice was a straight blade , similar to the one he had used in his fight against Go Geom Wol. Though it resembled his previous blade in shape and weight, it was of inferior quality due to the smith’s lack of skill.

After settling the bill with the smith, Lee Gwak and Cheong stepped outside.

Next, they needed to buy horses.

If Lee Gwak had been traveling alone, there would have been no need for horses. But since Cheong lacked stamina, it was essential.

Fortunately, Jucheon had a large horse market.

Merchants and martial artists going to the outer regions sold their horses and bought camels here, and vice versa for those coming in.

Once again, Lee Gwak let Cheong choose.

Neighs echoed around them. Unfazed by the sounds, Cheong carefully examined the horses.

“Is the young master choosing a horse? How about this one? It’s a Hanxue horse, known as the king of ten thousand horses.”

“Hey! Are you trying to trick an innocent boy? Come this way, young master. We just received some excellent horses yesterday.”

The merchants tried to entice Cheong, but he ignored their words and continued walking through the horse market.

‘The head and shoulders should be high, eyes clear and distinct, large nostrils, closely spaced ribs for good lung capacity to run long distances. Hmm! What else? Ah! Thin shinbones.’

Recalling what he’d read about selecting good horses, he examined each one.

After a thorough search, he chose a black horse that met all his criteria. It was still young and hadn’t fully grown, but that only made it more appealing to him.

“Dad! I want this one.”

“Haha! Young man, you have quite an eye! This horse came in just yesterday from a merchant heading to the Western Regions. It’s young now, but once grown, it’ll easily cover several hundred li in a day.”

The merchant admired Cheong’s choice.

The job of haggling over the price fell to Lee Gwak.

He purchased both Cheong’s horse and one for himself at a fair price.

Leading their new horses, they headed to an inn.

All the way, Cheong couldn’t hide his delight, smiling continuously.

Traveling with his father, buying horses—it all thrilled him. Though he knew they were journeying because of troubling matters, his excitement wasn’t dampened.

As Jucheon was an important travel hub, there were many inns in the city. Still, there were times when so many people gathered that it was almost impossible to find a room. Fortunately, there were fewer travelers due to the ongoing war, so it wasn’t difficult to find a room.

Lee Gwak and Cheong found a moderately sized inn.

“Welcome.”

“Please give the horses good hay and beans.”

Lee Gwak tossed two coins to the stable boy.

“Hehe! Leave it to me. I’ll feed them the best.”

The boy’s face lit up with a grin.

Most inns in Juchon were frequented by merchants or martial artists, so they had stables to take care of horses. However, it was extremely rare for someone to give extra money when entrusting their horses.

To him, Lee Gwak was a godsend. He placed Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong’s horses in the best stable.

Lee Gwak entered the inn first, while Cheong stayed back to ensure the horses were well taken care of.

“Brother, please take good care of them.”

“Don’t worry. I’m the best when it comes to looking after horses.”

“Really?”

“Of course! My dream is to run a horse ranch once I’ve saved enough money. So don’t worry, go and rest.”

“Okay!”

Cheong smiled and hurried into the inn.

Reflecting the current turmoil in the Jianghu, the inn was rather quiet. The dining hall, which should have been bustling with people, had plenty of empty seats.

Cheong quickly spotted Lee Gwak, who was sitting by a window.

“Dad!”

“I ordered Dongpo pork and hua cake. Is that alright?”

“Yes!”

With a bright smile, Cheong sat across from Lee Gwak.

He felt his heart race.

The fact that he was buying horses and traveling with his father excited him deeply. Though he knew his father was on this long journey due to serious matters, his excitement didn’t diminish.

Cheong curiously scanned the inn’s dining hall.

Though there were empty seats, there were still quite a few people inside.

Most of the people were either merchants or martial artists; there were no common folk.

Typically, merchants hired escorts or bodyguards when traveling to the outer regions, buying their safety with money.

As a result, it was rare to see merchants carrying weapons themselves. But now, things were different. Even though they had hired escorts, every merchant carried a weapon at their waist.

This was proof of the chaos in the Jianghu.

Though it had been three years since the conflict began, there seemed to be no end in sight. As a result, the Jianghu was in utter turmoil.

There were even cases where escort agencies betrayed the merchants they were supposed to protect, killing them and making off with their goods. Merchants, despite hiring protection, lived in constant fear.

The fact that the merchants in the inn were armed was due to these circumstances. Though their weapons wouldn’t stand a chance against a betrayal, it at least provided them with some sense of security.

The merchants’ complaints reached where Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong were sitting.

“When will this damned war end? Sigh…”

“Isn’t that the truth? It’s already been three years, and there’s no end in sight. It’s so frustrating.”

“What’s the point of this war that the Jade Heaven Alliance started? It’s killing us not to have the protection of the Merchant Guild.”

Fatigue was evident on the merchants’ faces.

And they weren’t the only ones.

The martial artists sitting in the distance also had irritated expressions as they drank their liquor.

“Damn it! This is unbearable. Things were never like this before. We used to get along well, but now it’s like we’re strangers.”

“What can we do? It’s all because of the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“Damn that Jade Heaven Alliance.”

As the war dragged on, resentment toward the Jade Heaven Alliance soared. Both merchants and martial artists voiced their frustrations.

Hearing their conversation, Cheong’s expression darkened.

“Everyone seems to be suffering.”

“Yes, they are.”

“Why did the leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance start this war? If he had just stayed put, he would still be hailed as a hero.”

“Someone’s trivial reasons and obsessions can plunge countless people into suffering. That’s why the higher one’s position, the more they need to be careful about their conduct.”

“Hm.”

Cheong furrowed his brow deeply.

His father’s words made him think deeply. But his contemplation didn’t last long.

“Here’s your food.”

The innkeeper brought out the Dongpo pork, hua cake, and a bottle of liquor that Lee Gwak had ordered.

“Let’s eat.”

“Yes!”

Cheong eagerly picked up his chopsticks.

Lee Gwak served Cheong a portion of the Dongpo pork and raised his cup of liquor.

Just as he brought the cup to his lips, the inn door burst open, and a group of people rushed in.
