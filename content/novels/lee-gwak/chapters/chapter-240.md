Lee Gwak silently gazed at the two children sleeping soundly.

As soon as Lee Soo-ah and Lee Cheong arrived at Dragon Heaven Valley, they almost collapsed from exhaustion and fell asleep immediately.

Mok Seon Wol had provided Lee Gwak’s family and Cheol Gwang-woo with the best room in the guesthouse. Thanks to this, the children were able to sleep soundly under soft silk blankets on a plush bed.

Lee Gwak reached out and gently stroked Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah. As if on cue, both children smiled in their sleep.

It seemed that the comfort they felt was reflected in their smiles. Watching them, Lee Gwak felt an unusual urge to cry.

He covered his mouth with his hand, continuing to watch the children for a long time.

Suddenly, he thought of Han So-cheon.

A shadow fell over Lee Gwak’s eyes.

He didn’t know what kind of hardships she was enduring at this moment. White Light Sect, having lost the children, would be furious. They would not easily give up on her.

In his heart, he wanted to run to where Han So-cheon was right away. But he knew she wouldn’t want him to leave the children behind.

The most important thing now was to find the divine physician and cure Lee Cheong’s illness.

‘I will cure you, no matter what.’

Although he was reluctant to leave the children behind, there was something he needed to do.

Stepping outside the guesthouse, a picturesque landscape unfolded before him.

The valley, filled with strange rocks and all kinds of rare flowers and plants, was dotted with beautiful pavilions.

This beautiful valley was none other than Dragon Heaven Valley, one of the Ten Great Sects.

As Lee Gwak stepped outside, a man in his early forties approached and bowed.

“Have you come out, Grand Master Lee?”

“Grand Master? That’s hardly appropriate for me.”

“I’ve heard about your astonishing martial prowess against White Light Sect. You more than deserve the title of ‘Grand Master’.

The man was Mak Sa-cheong, the External Affairs Chief of Dragon Heaven Valley.

As the person in charge of external affairs, he held significant power. Seeing such a man treat him with extreme politeness, Lee Gwak couldn’t hide his discomfort.

Mak Sa-cheong smiled faintly at Lee Gwak’s discomfort.

It was easy to read Lee Gwak’s thoughts from his expression.

‘It seems this man underestimates his own worth.’

Alone with Cheol Gwang-woo, he had broken through White Light Sect’s Heaven and Earth Net. That fact alone was enough to acknowledge him as one of the top martial artists in the jianghu.

But Lee Gwak’s accomplishments weren’t limited to just that.

He had subdued one of the ten lesser skies, Woo Mun Pae, killed the Gatekeeper Assassin Moon Gwang of the White Light Sect, faced off against Yong Cheon-myeong, and single-handedly invaded White Light Sect to kill their highest elder, Noh Tae-tae. None of these feats were ordinary.

Moreover, there was not a single unjust act in all that he had done.

Whether intentional or not, everything he had done was close to the ideals of a hero. If such a man is not called a Grand Master, what else could he be called?

Mak Sa-cheong had Lee Gwak firmly etched in his mind as a hero.

“The lady asked me to escort you to her once you came out.”

Mak Sa-cheong personally led Lee Gwak.

Given his position in Dragon Heaven Valley, it was an extraordinary act, yet Mak Sa-cheong willingly took on the role of a guide.

Lee Gwak was deemed worthy of such treatment.

The news that Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang-woo had broken through White Light Sect’s Heaven And Earth Net was already spreading rapidly throughout the Jianghu.

The martial artists didn’t care about the specifics of his situation.

Why he had to confront the White Light Sect and break through the Heaven And Earth Net was of no interest to them. What mattered was the fact that Lee Gwak had done it.

Since the Ten Great Sects came to dominate the Jianghu, no martial artist had dared to challenge their authority.

The Jianghu revolved around the Ten Great Sects.

Lee Gwak was the first martial artist to put a dent in their authority since they came to power.

The people were in awe of Lee Gwak’s unbelievable prowess.

So much so that the upcoming Heavenly assembly at Jade Heaven Alliance was almost overshadowed.

Lee Gwak’s fame soared to the skies, and Cheol Gwang-woo, who had been with him, also gained tremendous fame.

That was Cheol Gwang-woo’s nickname.

White Light Sect tried to suppress their defeat with Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang-woo, but it was impossible to silence all the martial artists involved in the Heaven and Earth Net.

On the contrary, those who had witnessed the two men’s martial prowess were eagerly spreading the tale. As a result, the fame of the two skyrocketed, while the White Light Sect’s reputation hit rock bottom.

Mak Sa-cheong, who viewed White Light Sect unfavorably, treated Lee Gwak with even greater respect for bringing shame upon them.

Mak Sa-cheong led Lee Gwak to a large hall.

“The lady is waiting for you inside.”

Mak Sa-cheong smiled and stepped back, and Lee Gwak entered the hall.

Inside, Mok Seon Wol and several elderly men were waiting for him. As soon as he entered, Mok Seon Wol stood up to greet him.

“Welcome. Leader Lee… no, Grand Master Lee!”

“You can address me more casually.”

“I can’t do that. In Jianghu, a person’s reputation is their status.”

“You might find it burdensome now, but you’ll have to get used to it. With your fame now widespread in the Jianghu, there’s no going back to your old life as a mere squad leader.”

“Thank you for your sincere advice.”

“Even without my advice, Grand Master Lee, you’ll manage just fine. As you always have.”

Instead of replying, Mok Seon Wol simply offered a radiant smile.

Her unveiled appearance was dazzlingly beautiful, but Lee Gwak felt no thrill. His heart was already full with Han So-cheon and his children.

Mok Seon Wol, observing Lee Gwak, introduced the elders present with her.

“You’ve met the 3rd and 5th elders before, right? These individuals are the highest elders of our sect, the Blood Elders of Dragon Heaven Valley.”

“It’s an honor to meet such esteemed figures. I am Lee Gwak.”

“Ha! The pleasure is ours, meeting a young hero of the Jianghu like yourself.”

“Have you considered joining our valley? If you do, I’m sure the Valley Lord will hold you in high regard.”

“Who wouldn’t welcome a martial artist of your caliber? It’s a shame you’re already married with children, but for a hero, having three or four concubines isn’t an issue.”

The elders chattered away, causing Mok Seon-wol to turn bright red and glare at the first elder.

“Please, stop talking nonsense.”

The first elder turned away, unable to withstand Mok Seon Wol’s sharp gaze. Then, Mok Seon Wol returned to her usual demeanor and looked at Lee Gwak.

“I apologize. The elders can be a bit unruly.”

“What are your plans now, Grand Master Lee? If you wish, you could seek refuge with us in Dragon Heaven Valley. We don’t fear White Light Sect.”

“I appreciate the offer, but I must decline.”

“Why is that? Is our Dragon Heaven Valley not to your satisfaction?”

“That’s not it. My child is very ill. I need to find the divine physician.”

“It seems you are not familiar with the term.”

“That’s… I’m hearing about it for the first time. I’m sorry. However, we have many physicians here in Dragon Heaven Valley. Surely, they could find a cure.”

Seizing the opportunity, Mok Seon Wol summoned all the physicians within Dragon Heaven Valley.

Any prestigious sect in Jianghu would have at least one or two doctors to care for their members, but Dragon Heaven Valley had over ten. All of them were highly skilled and trusted by the sect members. However, none could diagnose Lee Cheong’s illness.

Instead, their attempts to examine him only caused Lee Cheong more discomfort. This left Mok Seon-wol feeling apologetic.

Their attempts at diagnosis only served to distress Lee Cheong, for which Mok Seon Wol could not hide her apologies.

“I’m sorry, Grand Master Lee. This was not my intention.”

“Then, you must be set on finding the divine physician. Do you have any leads?”

“I heard she was seen near Mount Yeo, so I plan to head there.”

“Time is of the essence, then.”

“That’s why I’m leaving immediately.”

The supply of Life Saving Pills he carried was limited. According to Lee Soo-ah, they had enough for only about a month. With careful rationing, perhaps they could stretch it to a month and a half, but that was only if Lee Cheong’s condition remained stable.

Knowing that Lee Cheong didn’t have much time left made Lee Gwak anxious.

“Whew! There’s no choice, then. I’ll assign a guide to take you to the edge of our valley’s territory. He’s familiar with the area and will save you a lot of time.”

“Thank you. I will not forget this kindness.”

“What kindness? It’s simply about helping each other out, right?” Mok Seon Wol smiled warmly.

Upon returning to the guest quarters, Cheol Gwang-woo greeted Lee Gwak warmly.

“I’m much better now,” Cheol Gwang-woo responded, patting his chest confidently.

When they first arrived, Cheol Gwang-woo’s internal injuries were severe. No matter how strong his Vajra Demon Shadow Technique was, it couldn’t protect his internal organs from the devastating effects of the Heaven and Earth Net.

It was only his extraordinary determination to protect Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah that kept him on his feet; otherwise, he would have collapsed long ago.

Recognizing the severity of his condition, Dragon Heaven Valley had administered a rare elixir to him. Over the past two days, Cheol Gwang-woo focused on circulating his qi to absorb the elixir fully.

It turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as the elixir greatly increased his internal energy and helped him overcome a major barrier.

It wasn’t a breakthrough to a major level of cultivation, but it felt like he had achieved a minor one.

His qi flowed unobstructed throughout his body, a refreshingly new sensation for him.

‘Gwang-woo has advanced. At this level, there’s no need to worry about him losing control to madness anymore.’

Lee Gwak patted Cheol Gwang-woo’s shoulder, and Cheol Gwang-woo responded with a smile.

Lee Soo-ah and Lee Cheong burst out of the hall like squirrels, rushing into Lee Gwak’s arms.

Lee Gwak lifted both children at once.

“It’s not a lie. I’m already healed. Want to see?”

“Look! The scabs have formed. It means I’m healing well.”

Lee Gwak set the children down and rolled up his sleeve to show his bare skin. His forearm was covered in scabs from wounds that hadn’t fully healed yet.

Such injuries were considered minor. Hidden under his clothes were deeper and more fatal wounds that should have been resting and healing, but Lee Gwak relied on the Eight Snakes Art for healing.

The mysterious healing properties within the Eight Snakes Art would surely help heal his internal and external injuries on the journey to Mount Ye.

Lee Soo-ah hugged Lee Gwak’s waist tightly, tears filling her eyes.

“Dad’s fine, really. Stop being a crybaby. Dry your tears now!”

Finally, Lee Soo-ah wiped her tears with her sleeve.

“How are you feeling, Cheong?”

“We have to go, right? Don’t worry about me, Daddy.”

Lee Gwak gently caressed Lee Cheong’s cheek.

His son had matured too quickly for his age. Lee Gwak found it both admirable and heartbreaking.

“Are we going to Mount Yeo now?”

“Just everything… It feels like it’s all because of me…”

“I’m your father. It’s my duty to protect and care for you. I couldn’t do that for the past six years, so let me do it now.”

Lee Gwak stroked Lee Cheong’s head, eliciting a shy smile from him.

Lee Soo-ah watched the two of them and smiled.

‘It’s really fortunate. Really…’

But suddenly, tears welled up in her eyes.

She tried to hold them back, but large teardrops fell nonetheless.

Lee Soo-ah embraced Lee Gwak tightly.
