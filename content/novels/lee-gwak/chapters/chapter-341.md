“Humph! I was all excited for Dragon Heaven Valley, but it’s nothing special.”

A young martial artist, appearing to be in his late teens to early twenties, sneered as he looked around the streets of Taegang.

He was a handsome man with features as finely carved as jade. He wore a sky-blue martial uniform embroidered with elaborate designs and carried a precious-looking sword at his waist.

His name was Ok Cheon-hwa.

Ok Cheon-hwa had come to Dragon Heaven Valley with Woo Mun-pae, following the Martial Sword Troupe.

Among the many martial artists who had made a name for themselves in the Martial Sword Troupe, Ok Cheon-hwa was special.

His nickname was Young Hero of the South Sea, a title he earned after winning a martial arts tournament held by the Martial Sword Troupe a few years ago.

After winning the tournament, his life changed.

He was personally taught techniques by Yu Mun-sang, the head of the Martial Sword Troupe, which greatly improved his martial arts skills. He quickly rose through the ranks and was now one of Woo Mun-pae’s closest associates.

He had undoubtedly lived a successful life.

Having tasted success at a young age, Ok Cheon-hwa naturally became arrogant.

The leaders of the Woomun faction and Mugyeomryeon were discussing future plans with the leaders of Yongcheon Valley.

Ok Cheon-hwa was entitled to attend the meeting, but he deliberately skipped it. Being young and full of vigor, he lacked the patience to sit through a tedious meeting in a confined room.

Instead, he went out alone to explore the streets of Taegang. However, the scenery of Taegang did not make a strong impression on him.

He had grown up seeing the vast ocean, and compared to that, the streets of Taegang felt suffocating.

“Well, I should at least look around.”

Ok Cheon-hwa began to walk.

He strolled leisurely, but his eyes shone sharply.

He was not just out to sightsee; he had come alone to gauge the atmosphere of Taegang.

Taegang was virtually the front yard of Dragon Heaven Valley. Understanding its atmosphere would give him insight into the atmosphere of Dragon Heaven Valley as well.

Ok Cheon-hwa idly swung the fan in his hand as he wandered around the streets of Taegang.

Several women smiled at him as they passed.

Ok Cheon-hwa was undeniably handsome. He had not been in town long, but there were already women who adored him.

He was well aware of his good looks and used them to his advantage.

“Miss!”

“Yes?”

Some women blushed just from him speaking to them.

A smile played on Ok Cheon-hwa’s lips.

He wasn’t particularly impressed with the streets, but the beauty of the women passing by definitely caught his eye.

Suddenly, he noticed a woman leaving an inn.

She wasn’t prettier than the others he had approached, but there was something vibrantly attractive about her.

Ok Cheon-hwa approached her with a sly smile.

“Excuse me, miss! May I speak with you?”

“Yes?”

“Do you live here?”

“Why do you ask?”

Instead of answering, Ok Cheon-hwa just smiled slyly.

Normally, this was enough to make most women flustered and unsure of what to do next. However, the woman in front of him reacted differently.

She frowned as if she had seen something unpleasant.

Taken aback by this unusual response, Ok Cheon-hwa hesitated but then continued with a suave smile.

“I’m new here, could you perhaps show me around?”

“Are you insane?”

“What?”

“I’ve never met you before, and you want me to show you around? Does that make sense to you?”

“Why wouldn’t it? Even a single conversation can lead to a connection. Meeting like this could be the result of a bond formed over three lifetimes.”

“Really, what nonsense…”

The woman backed away with disgust.

Her name was Bang Ye-in.

She had just stepped out for some air and certainly did not expect to encounter such a sleazy man in broad daylight.

In his frustration, he grabbed her delicate wrist without thinking.

“Now, why would you look at me that way when I’m just trying to talk?”

“Let go of me! What are you doing?”

As the situation escalated, Ok Cheon-hwa grew more irritated.

He couldn’t stand the fact that a not particularly pretty woman was making a fuss.

“Just how are you looking at people…”

That’s when it happened.

“Let go of her.”

Suddenly, a giant mountain rose behind Bang Ye-in.

“Huh?”

Ok Cheon-hwa’s eyes widened.

Behind Bang Ye-in stood a massive man, Cheol Gwang Woo, glaring at him fiercely.

“Ah!”

Startled, Ok Cheon-hwa instinctively unfolded his martial art, the Sixteen Waves Blade Technique.

Shiiik!

As he launched an unexpected attack, Cheol Gwang Woo’s expression turned even more ferocious.

“What?”

Just yesterday, some old men called the Mangshan Seven Demons had been pestering Bang Ye-in, and now another young man was causing trouble. This annoyed Cheol Gwang Woo greatly.

He gathered his internal energy and swung his fist.

Clang!

The sound of metal clashing rang out as his fist collided with the sword.

The strong recoil sent Ok Cheon-hwa staggering back.

“So you’ve got some skills hidden up your sleeve.”

A murderous intent flashed in Ok Cheon-hwa’s eyes.

His decisive attack had been blocked.

Although he was technically at fault for the situation, his pride was wounded, and he didn’t consider that.

He now saw Cheol Gwang Woo as an enemy.

His moves became even more ruthless.

Sssack!

Although he was the one who started it, his wounded pride blinded him to reason. He now saw Cheol Gwang Woo as an enemy and his attacks became more vicious.

Ok Cheon-hwa unleashed the most lethal technique of the Sixteen Waves Blade Technique

At this point it was no longer a simple misunderstanding. Ok Cheon-hwa clearly wanted to kill Cheol Gwang Woo.

Even under such circumstances, Cheol Gwang Woo was not merciful. A dark light appeared in his eyes.

“This damn bastard…”

Cheol Gwang Woo performed one of his most powerful techniques, the Vajra Demolition Palm, with his massive hands that could even crush a diamond stone.

Crack!

Ok Cheon-hwa’s sword shattered into pieces against Cheol Gwang Woo’s palm.

“Ah!”

Shocked, Ok Cheon-hwa’s face turned pale.

In an instant, Cheol Gwang Woo’s palm hit his face.

Splash!

“Argh!”

Ok Cheon-hwa’s head snapped back with a scream.

Blood spurted and broken teeth flew. His once beautiful face was now swollen and distorted beyond recognition.

Ok Cheon-hwa was momentarily dazed by the impact.

As he tried to regain his senses, Cheol Gwang Woo’s palm exploded against the other side of his face.

Splat!

With a crunching sound, Ok Cheon-hwa’s head whipped around again.

His face was swollen and distorted, unrecognisable from before.

“Just a moment…”

Ok Cheon-hwa waved his hands in desperation and backed away, but Cheol Gwang Woo showed no mercy.

“You attack at will and now you want to stop just like that?”

Cheol Gwang Woo was already moved to kill.

Normally, he kept his anger under control, but he lost it when he saw someone mistreating Bang Ye-in.

He clenched his fist again.

His fist, tempered by the Vajra Demolition Technique, was a fearsome weapon in itself.

Defenceless, Ok Cheon-hwa had no way to block it.

“No!”

Bang Ye-in’s voice came from behind, but Cheol Gwang Woo paid no attention.

His boiling rage was not something that could be cooled by a word from Bang Ye-in.

Whoosh!

His fist, filled with overwhelming power, flew towards Ok Cheon-hwa.

“Stop!”

A short, powerful shout echoed through the streets.

Boom!

After a loud noise, Cheol Gwang Woo’s arm was suddenly deflected outwards. Someone had sent a powerful force to protect Ok Cheon-hwa from Cheol Gwang Woo’s attack.

“How dare you attack a disciple of the Martial Sword Troupe. Are you seeking death?”

Growl!

A menacing voice filled the air as a large figure dropped down between Cheol Gwang Woo and Ok Cheon-hwa.

With a commanding stature and fierce eyes like a tiger, the man exuding an intense presence was none other than Woo Mun-pae, young master of the Martial Sword Troupe.

He had rescued Ok Cheon-hwa from danger.

Kuuu!

The air around them shook violently as Woo Mun-pae appeared. His tiger-like eyes were filled with killing intent.

He didn’t know or care about the reason for the clash between Cheol Gwang-woo and Ok Cheon-hwa. What mattered to him was that Ok Cheon-hwa, his trusted subordinate, was beaten by an unknown bear-like brute.

He could discipline a disciple of the Martial Sword Troupe, but it was absolutely unacceptable for a disciple to be beaten by an outsider.

Kwaaa!

As he swung his hand, a powerful fist qi flew towards Cheol Gwang-woo’s head, intending to burst it open and kill him instantly.

“Kuh!”

Cheol Gwang Woo grimaced and used his Vajra Demon Shadow Technique

with all his might.

Boom!

An explosion erupted between the two men.

The collision of the Vajra Demolition Technique and the fist qi caused an explosion that made the nearby buildings tremble as if they were about to collapse.

“Not bad.”

When Cheol Gwang Woo managed to block the fist qi, Woo Mun-pae’s eyebrows shot up while Cheol Gwang Woo’s expression twisted slightly.

Although he had deflected the attack, the impact had still reverberated through his body, leaving him with a tingling sensation and considerable internal damage.

Woo Mun-pae’s strength was undeniable.

Over the years, Cheol Gwang Woo had become considerably stronger, but compared to Woo Mun-pae, who had been famous long before Cheol Gwang Woo ever entered the Jianghu, there were inevitably shortcomings.

Instinctively, Cheol Gwang Woo realised that Woo Mun-pae was stronger than him. But retreating was not an option. The woman he loved, Bang Ye-in, was standing behind him. He couldn’t be cowardly in front of her. Instead, his fighting spirit burned even brighter.

Woo Mun-pae watched Cheol Gwang Woo and spoke.

“Huh! You’re really tough. It’s a waste to kill you like this. Surrender and I’ll take you under my wing. Serve me.”

“Enough of your nonsense. Your subordinate molests another man’s wife, and now you speak nonsense without even understanding the situation.”

“Nonsense?”

Woo Mun-pae’s eyes glittered with killing intent. He was truly angry now.

He raised his hand and a massive surge of qi gathered in his palm.

It was the Iron Canon Demon Qi.

A technique that condensed qi to its extreme, firing it like a cannon. It possessed an immense power, incomparable to ordinary qi.

This was a supreme martial art developed by Yu Mun-sang, the head of the Martial Sword Troupe, incorporating insights from his later years. Its power was well beyond what Cheol Gwang Woo could handle.

Cheol Gwang Woo sensed this instinctively, yet he did not back down.

His face contorted with madness.

Since a normal approach was futile, he was ready to unleash the madness he had been suppressing.

That’s when it happened.

“Step back, Gwang Woo.”

A warm voice came from behind.

At that moment, the madness consuming Cheol Gwang Woo vanished without a trace.

He didn’t need to look back to know who it was.

“Brother!”

It was Lee Gwak.

Without a word, Cheol Gwang Woo stepped back.

Woo Mun-pae’s killing intent deepened upon seeing this.

“Did you think you could just retreat as you please?”

Boom!

He launched the Iron Canon Demon Qi at Cheol Gwang Woo, who was retreating.

The qi, like a cannonball, flew at a terrifying speed. However, there was not a trace of fear in Cheol Gwang Woo’s eyes.

The reason soon became clear.

A white blade appeared before Cheol Gwang Woo.

The straight blade smoothly curved around the incoming Iron Canon Demon Qi and then deflected it to the left.

Boom!

The Iron Canon Demon Qi exploded in the middle of the street next to the inn, overturning the ground and creating a huge crater.

It was a horrifying sight that made one’s scalp tingle.

Woo Mun-pae’s gaze grew intense.

Although he hadn’t used his full strength, he had exerted at least eighty percent of his energy. He was confident that very few in the world could withstand it, but his pride was shattered by the mysterious intervenor.

Woo Mun-pae’s gaze turned to the man who had just appeared in front of Cheol Gwang Woo.

A tall man with an ordinary appearance was none other than Lee Gwak.

He held his blade loosely, staring calmly at Woo Mun-pae.

“Who are you?”
