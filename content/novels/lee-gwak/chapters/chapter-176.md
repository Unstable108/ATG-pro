“Wow, I can finally see where people live”

Cheol Gwang Woo exclaimed as he saw a distant city.

They had been camping out for the past three days.

When he slept on the hard ground every night, his whole body ached so much that he feared he might fall ill.

At first, camping out seemed romantic, but now he no longer felt that way.

‘Sleeping in a soft bed is indeed the best.’

Cheol Gwang Woo realized that experiencing romance required enduring physical hardships.

Even for Cheol Gwang Woo, whose body was as tough as iron, he had no desire to strain his body any further.

The leader of the escort service, Lee Won-chang, shouted,

“Our first destination, Hwado County, is here. We will rest here for two days, so everyone, make sure to thoroughly check everything and protect the cargo.”

Du Yeo-gwang and the other escorts responded energetically.

A puzzled expression appeared on Lee Gwak’s face.

Normally, the business of an escort service was to deliver the cargo on time or as quickly as possible.

While it was possible to rest for a day due to circumstances, staying for two days was extremely rare.

Lee Gwak asked the porter who was leading the cargo wagon,

“Why are we resting here for two days? Is there a reason?”

“Ah, it’s because of Master Cheongunbi’s birthday celebration.”

“Excuse me?”

“You don’t know Master Cheongunbi, the Righteous Wanderer?”

The porter looked puzzled.

Master Cheongunbi, the Righteous Wanderer, was the most famous veteran in the vicinity.

Not only was his martial arts prowess renowned, but his sense of justice was also strong. He never turned a blind eye to injustice and always stood on the side of the weak.

People praised Master Cheongunbi as the Righteous Wanderer and celebrated him.

His birthday was practically the biggest festival in Hwado County. To celebrate his birthday, not only notable figures from the vicinity but also numerous martial arts sects sent people to congratulate him.

Lee Won-chang, the leader of the Shenyang Escort Service, had known Cheongunbi for a long time and would always attend his birthday celebrations, unless there were pressing matters elsewhere.

It was to the extent that, despite the tight schedule of this cargo delivery, he chose a route that passed through Hwado County.

“The client also agreed to stay here for two days?”

“From the beginning, that was a condition of accepting the job. If the client had not agreed to stay here for two days, our leader would definitely not have undertaken this escort journey.”

Lee Gwak nodded in understanding.

“It seems the leader is very close to Master Cheongunbi. Given that he makes time to attend the birthday celebration.”

“Master Cheongunbi is a lifesaver. It must have been over a decade ago. We were on an escort mission and were about to be annihilated by the villains of the Jianghu. By chance, Master Cheongunbi, who was passing by, helped us and saved our lives. Since then, we have considered him to be our savior and have visited him every year.”

“That’s remarkable. Not missing a single year.”

Lee Gwak was genuinely impressed.

Many people forget or ignore the kindness they have received, but Lee Won-chang had visited Cheongunbi every year for over a decade.

Regardless of anything else, his determination to repay the kindness and not forget it was commendable.

As Lee Gwak conversed with the porter, the Shenyang Escort Service entered Hwado County. Hwado County was the largest city in the area. Consequently, the streets were wide, and many people came and went.

The Shenyang Escort Service always stayed at the Red Moon Inn when in Hwado County.

The Red Moon Inn was the largest inn in Hwado County and had large warehouses and stables, making it suitable for large groups such as the Shenyang Escort Service to store their goods and stay.

Of course, guarding the storage was the responsibility of those who stored goods and stayed there. Hence, the escorts of the Shenyang Escort Service had to take turns guarding while staying at the Red Moon Inn.

The porter who spoke with Lee Gwak also mentioned that there was unlikely to be any trouble even if they didn’t stand guard. This indicated that the public order in Hwado County was good

Typically, four people shared one room, but Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo were assigned separate rooms. This was partly due to Cheol Gwang Woo’s large size, but also because others were reluctant to share a room with them.

The escorts formed their own groups, and the vagrants looked down on Lee Gwak.

Given the situation, Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo, like oil and water, inevitably remained outsiders.

Getting off the cargo wagon, Lee Gwak glanced at the carriage the elderly client was in.

Except for the first night of camping, the old man never emerged from the carriage, managing all his needs—including eating and relieving himself—within it

The elder, clad in his characteristic deep-hooded robe, quickly exited the carriage and entered the private quarters of the inn, as if to avoid being seen.

Lee Won-chang called Du Yeo-gwang and ordered,

“While we are here, station escorts in the private quarters to ensure vigilant guarding. We cannot afford a single lapse.”

“Do not worry, leader. I will personally lead my men and guard the private quarters.”

“That’s reassuring. I trust you.”

“As long as I, Du Yeo-gwang, am guarding, no one will lay a finger on the cargo.”

Du Yeo-gwang thumped his chest confidently.

Lee Won-chang looked at him with a trusting gaze for a moment before approaching where Lee Gwak was.

“Mr. Lee!”

“I assume you have heard. I have a close relationship with Master Cheong, so we plan to stay here for two days. Our escorts will guard the cargo, so please feel free to enjoy your time here for these two days.”

Although his words conveyed consideration, his eyes revealed distrust. The established vagrants in the vagrant market were well-known, but there was no information about Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo.

Thus, Du Yeo-gwang and the escorts could not fully trust Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo.

Lee Gwak was aware of this but did not show it.

“Thank you for your consideration.”

“No need for thanks! Well then…”

Lee Won-chang walked past Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo.

Lee Gwak said to Cheol Gwang Woo,

“Let’s take a break and have a meal.”

“Yes! Brother.”

Cheol Gwang Woo answered with an excited expression.

Having camped out day after day, he could hardly remember the last time he had a proper meal. The porters did try to provide, but the amount was far from sufficient for Cheol Gwang Woo.

Hence, he was famished for a long time and was now excited to finally have a proper meal.

The two walked shoulder to shoulder into the Red Moon Inn.

Like other inns, the first floor of the Red Moon Inn was operated as a restaurant. The restaurant was quite spacious, but already more than half of the seats were taken.

Customers kept coming in, and if they had arrived any later, there would have been no place to sit.

Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo hurriedly found a seat and sat down.

“Wow, What kind of person…….’

‘It’s like a bear walking on two legs”.

Even here, Cheol Gwang Woo’s immense size drew astonished stares from people. Customers could not help but gape in amazement at his enormous stature.

Cheol Gwang Woo clicked his tongue, clearly displeased by the stares. However, with Lee Gwak right beside him, he attempted to appear nonchalant and sat down.

“Welcome, dear guests.”

As soon as the two sat down, a woman in her early forties approached them.

The woman, the owner of the inn, looked at Cheol Gwang Woo with curiosity.

In her over twenty years of running the inn, she had never seen anyone as big as Cheol Gwang Woo. It was fascinating for her, as she had never imagined someone could be that large.

“Sir, your size is incredible. You must need a lot to maintain that size, right?”

“I thought so. How about our inn’s whole roasted pig? It’s stuffed with various fruits and vegetables and roasted all at once. It takes some time, but the taste is exceptional. It’s also quite plentiful, so it should be enough for you.”

Cheol Gwang Woo’s mouth watered at the description.

He looked at Lee Gwak with eager eyes.

“Brother?”

“Alright. Give us one roasted piglet. And bring a bottle of liquor as well.”

“We’ll start with the liquor and some appetizers first. Please wait a moment.”

The woman went to the kitchen with a smiling face.

After placing their order, Lee Gwak looked around the inn.

Perhaps because of Cheongunbi’s birthday, the inn was crowded with martial artists armed with weapons. Eavesdropping on their conversations revealed that the topics centered around Cheongunbi’s birthday celebration.

“Did you hear? This year’s celebration for Master Cheong is said to be the most lavish ever. The guests attending are not ordinary either.”

“Well, Master Cheong isn’t known as the Righteous Wanderer for nothing.”

“Having Master Cheong residing here is the greatest blessing for Hwado County.” People praised Cheongunbi enthusiastically.

Indeed, the main topic and interest among those here were Cheongunbi’s birthday celebration.

Cheol Gwang Woo whispered in a low voice,

“That Master Cheong seems to be truly remarkable.”

“It appears so.”

Lee Gwak nodded.

There was not a single bad thing to be heard about Cheongunbi.

‘He must either be a great person, or he has managed his reputation well.’

In the Jianghu, rumors rarely conveyed the whole truth.

Either way, since it was none of his concern, Lee Gwak didn’t pay it much mind.

In the meantime, the innkeeper returned with some snacks and a bottle of liquor. Lee Gwak filled Cheol Gwang Woo’s cup to the brim and then his own.

“Let’s drink.”

Cheol Gwang Woo chuckled and drank eagerly.

He had restrained himself while with the Shenyang Escort Service, but here, there was no need. Seeing Cheol Gwang Woo’s eagerness, Lee Gwak asked the innkeeper to bring a few more bottles of liquor.

Cheol Gwang Woo laughed merrily and drank heavily, while Lee Gwak, in contrast, quietly listened to his stories, merely sipping from his cup.

Although the liquor wasn’t as fine as what he had enjoyed at Jangmyeong Inn on Haenam Island, the Red Moon Inn’s offering was quite delicious.

The high-quality appetizers enhanced the experience, making it enjoyable. Thanks to this, Lee Gwak had a satisfying time for a change.”

After emptying a couple of bottles, the innkeeper came out with a large platter carrying the whole roasted pig. Cheol Gwang Woo’s mouth fell open at the sight.

He exclaimed, sniffing eagerly. The sweet scent of the fruits and vegetables stuffed inside the young pig mixed with its juices, tantalizing his sense of smell.

Just the aroma was enough to make one dizzy with pleasure.

“Here comes the Red Moon Inn’s special whole roast pig. Please enjoy.

As soon as the innkeeper placed the large platter with the pig on the table, Cheol Gwang Woo grabbed a leg in his hands.

“Brother, may I start?”

“Go ahead.”

“Thank you, brother.”

With Lee Gwak’s permission, Cheol Gwang Woo began to tear into the pig’s hind leg. Juice dripped down his chin as he chewed, but Cheol Gwang Woo didn’t mind.

The liquor was forgotten. In no time, Cheol Gwang Woo devoured one leg and began to eagerly eat the other.

His enjoyment was so evident that the people around them swallowed their saliva and watched. Lee Gwak served himself just enough food on his plate and continued drinking.

Good food, good liquor, and good company.

It was a moment of true happiness.

Lee Gwak fully enjoyed the present happiness.

Just then, the inn’s door burst open, revealing a group of people.

The attention of everyone in the inn quickly shifted to them.

“Phew! It’s quite crowded here.”

A man who seemed to be the leader of the group looked around the inn and whistled. A young man beside him explained,

“This is the biggest inn in Hwado. The food is quite good, so it’s always busy here.”

“Is that so? I’m looking forward to it.”

A smile formed on the leader’s face.

At the sight of his face, Lee Gwak slightly furrowed his brow, not expecting to encounter him here.

‘Woo Mun Pae.’

The leader was Woo Mun Pae, who had left Haenam Island before Lee Gwak. Accompanying him were Iron Half Sword -Yook Cheon-ban and Purple Shadow Goddess Gu Ok-rin.

“Isn’t that the Mad Dragon? The person next to him looks like Iron Half Sword -Yook Cheon-ban, and that woman seems to be Purple Shadow Goddess Gu Ok-rin.”

People recognized their identities and buzzed with excitement.

They were famous figures in the Jianghu.

Not just Woo Mun Pae, but Yook Cheon-ban and Gu Ok-rin were also well-known for their exploits. It would have been strange not to recognize them.

The murmuring grew louder. Despite the reactions of the people, Woo Mun Pae remained indifferent.

He was quite accustomed to such reactions from people.

“Is there an empty seat…”

Yook Cheon-ban moved forward first, looking for a seat.

Fortunately, a couple of good seats were available. Yook Cheon-ban was about to lead Woo Mun Pae to those spots when Woo Mun Pae’s gaze turned elsewhere.

Naturally, Yook Cheon-ban’s gaze followed to where Woo Mun Pae was looking.

It was the table where a young man and a large man were sitting.

The large man, resembling a bear in size, was devouring a whole roasted pig greedily, while the young man silently sipped his liquor.

The young man looked somewhat familiar.

After a moment of recollection, Yook Cheon-ban remembered meeting him at Haenam Island. Just as Yook Cheon-ban recognized Lee Gwak, Woo Mun Pae also recognized him at a glance.

Woo Mun Pae walked briskly towards Lee Gwak.

“Was your name Lee Gwak?”

“Master Woo Mun Pae.”

Lee Gwak put down his liquor cup and looked up at Woo Mun Pae.

Meeting Woo Mun Pae here was a coincidence, but that didn’t mean Lee Gwak felt intimidated by him.

Woo Mun Pae furrowed his brow at Lee Gwak.

“Why are you here?”

“Do I have a reason not to be?”

At that moment, Yook Cheon-ban bristled.

“How dare you speak to the grand master…”

Woo Mun Pae raised his hand to stop Yook Cheon-ban.

Though furious, Yook Cheon-ban had no choice but to close his mouth.

Woo Mun Pae looked down at Lee Gwak and spoke calmly.

“It seems our fates are more intertwined than I thought. Of all the places, to meet here again. Don’t you find it strange for a mere coincidence?”

“It’s just a coincidence.”

Lee Gwak stated flatly.
