After Lee Gwak and the Martial Sword Troupe joined the Thousand Kingdom School, the war entered a lull. Both the Thousand Kingdom School and the Celestial Demon Troupe had suffered heavy losses and needed time to recover.

During that time, Cheol Gwang-woo and the warriors of the Mad Martial Sect gradually joined the Thousand Kingdom School.

With Martial Sword Troupe and now even the elite of Mad Martial Sect joining, the Thousand Kingdom School began to regain vitality. Until then, they had felt isolated and stranded on a vast ocean.

The desperate situation, with no external aid in sight, had caused that feeling. But now, solid reinforcements had arrived.

The morale of the Thousand Kingdom School warriors revived.

The news that Mad Martial Sect and Martial Sword Troupe had joined the Thousand Kingdom School spread quickly across the Jianghu.

This alliance of two sects spurred those who had merely been watching from the sidelines. Until now, they had shut their gates, believing there was no chance of victory. But with these two joining, they began to believe that the Thousand Kingdom School actually had a chance.

Above all, Lee Gwak’s decision to join the Thousand Kingdom School caused a great stir.

With Ja Hong-cheon dead, Lee Gwak was now the greatest master in the Jianghu.

He was the only martial artist in the current world who could fight against Go Geom-wol.

Lee Gwak’s alliance made the sects and martial artists who had only been watching from the sidelines believe it was worth fighting at least once.

For this reason, Nam Woo-gyeong deliberately spread the news that the Mad Martial Sect and the Martial Sword Troupe had joined the Thousand Kingdom School.

Although they weren’t large sects, the significance of their alliance was not small. It meant that the fragmented and divided Jianghu could potentially unite around Lee Gwak as a central figure.

Namgung Woo-gyeong mobilized the Hao Clan’s entire intelligence network to widely spread a series of rumors. Among these rumors was the news of the Myriad Merchant Troupe’s betrayal.

The rumor that the Myriad Merchant Troupe, one of the Seven Great Sects and a gathering of the world’s merchants, had betrayed the Jianghu and sided with the Celestial Demon Troupe spread like wildfire.

The martial artists who heard the rumor were all enraged.

No matter how fragmented and at each other’s throats they had been, betraying the martial world and joining the Celestial Demon Troupe was absolutely unforgivable.

The Myriad Merchant Troupe became the target of criticism.

The merchants, already suffering due to the war now found themselves even more cornered.

Because of this, merchants began to leave the All Things Association and declare independence. At first, only a very small number of merchants left, but as time passed this trend accelerated.

Meanwhile, the Thousand Kingdom School and the Celestial Demon Troupe clashed again. This time, however, with the support of the Mad Martial Sect and the Myriad Merchant Troupe, the Thousand Kingdom School managed to drive the Celestial Demon Troupe back.

At the center of it all was Lim Sobo.

Her arrival brought structure to the otherwise chaotic alliance between the Thousand Kingdom School, the Mad Martial Sect, and the Martial Sword Troupe.

Lim So-bo fully utilized her talent to reorganize the forces and create a system to efficiently counter the Celestial Demon Troupe.

The leaders of the Thousand Kingdom School sighed with regret at Lim So-bo’s performance.

They were responsible for neglecting her and letting her leave when she was the joint strategist for the Thousand Kingdom School and the Heaven High Castle.

At that time, they had disregarded her because they disapproved of a young girl acting out of turn. But now, watching her display such outstanding talent and coordinate the three sects overwhelmed them with regret.

“Hah! If only So-bo had been here, would the Thousand Kingdom School have fallen into this state?”

“We had a genius in our midst, and we ignored her. We were blind fools.”

Even now, they wanted to bring Lim So-bo back as their strategist. But everyone knew that was impossible.

Lim So-bo had clearly stated that she was the strategist of the Mad Martial Sect and had no intention of moving to any other sect.

In the end, the Thousand Kingdom School’s leadership had no choice but to give up on Lim So-bo.

Lim So-bo rubbed her throbbing temples with her fingers and headed to Lee Gwak’s quarters.

Lee Gwak happened to be in the front yard of his residence.

Next to him were Cheol Gwang-woo, Seo Jong-myeong, and others.

“Brother!”

“You came? You look very tired.”

“I was up all night, that’s why.”

“Are you alright?”

“It’s just one night, come on! I’m fine.”

“Don’t overstrain yourself. Many people here rely on you. I’m afraid you might collapse.”

Lim So-bo bitterly wryly at Lee Gwak’s words.

“Don’t worry. I’m not that weak.”

“That’s a relief then.”

“More importantly, I have something to tell you.”

“What is it?”

“Several more sects have sent word of their intention to join us.”

“That’s good.”

Lee Gwak nodded his head.

Thanks to their ongoing victories, more and more sects now wanted to join the Thousand Kingdom School.

They urgently needed new accommodations to house the influx of warriors.

“It’s the first time since the founding of the Jade Heaven Alliance that so many sects have united.”

“Is that so?”

“Yes. But there’s a problem.”

“Problem?”

“We don’t have a leader.”

“What about Namgung In? He’s the master of Thousand Kingdom School.”

“He declined. First, he hasn’t fully recovered from his injuries. Second, he doesn’t believe he can lead such a large force.”

Lee Gwak frowned.

“What about Lady Sa of the Martial Sword Troupe or Lady Mok of the Dragon Heaven Valley?”

“They both declined. They’re already struggling just to manage their own sects.”

Indeed, Sa Yeon-hee was new to her leadership role, and Mok Seon-wol lacked the strength to handle more after losing their base to the Celestial Demon Troupe.

“You don’t mean…?”

“Yes. I want you, Brother, to lead them.”

“That is impossible. You know better than anyone that I am not fit for such a role.”

“Brother, you still underestimate yourself.”

“So-bo.”

“Most of these people here joined because of you. They saw hope in you and followed that light.”

“…”

“I know you hate leading. But only you can unite them. No one else can.”

“Hah…”

“You won’t have to micromanage. Just be the figurehead leader. Leave the details to me and the other leaders. We’ll handle everything. Just give them something to rally behind.”

Her eyes were pleading.

Lee Gwak glanced at Cheol Gwang-woo and Seo Jong-myeong, hoping for their support.

“Brother, we’ll help you.”

“You’re the only one they can trust.”

“I’m not a hero.”

“You may not think so, but others do.”

“…”

“Don’t turn away from their hopes.”

Seo Jong-myeong rested a hand on Lee Gwak’s shoulder.

He knew Lee Gwak disliked the spotlight. He just wanted to live peacefully with his family someday.

But now wasn’t the time.

Lee Gwak’s presence was too crucial to be ignored.

“Even if you’re not a hero, act like one. Don’t extinguish their hope.”

“…Very well.”

Reluctantly, Lee Gwak accepted.

And strangely, once he acknowledged that no one else could take on the role, the weight on his chest lightened slightly.

He turned to Lim Sobo.

“Summon the heads of all sects.”

“Yes!”

Lim So-bo did not ask for a reason.

Lee Gwak’s eyes were resolute.

He didn’t usually assert his opinions strongly. When he spoke this decisively, there was always a valid reason.

A leadership meeting was convened by Lim So-bo.

The leaders of the various sects gathered in the main hall of the Thousand Kingdom School.

Namgung In of the Thousand Kingdom School, Mok Seon-wol of the Dragon Heaven Valley, and Sa Yeon-hee of the Martial Sword Troupe gathered in one place, along with the leaders of the small and medium-sized sects who had come to support the Thousand Kingdom School.

The faces of the leaders gathered in the main hall were clearly filled with tension.

Especially the faces of the leaders of the small and medium-sized sects who had recently joined were stiff.

This was because three of the Seven Great Sects’ leaders were in the same room. And at the head seat was Lee Gwak.

They were the great masters of the current Jianghu.

They were such significant figures that merely being in the same room with them should be considered an honor. It was hard to believe they were sharing the same space.

Everyone’s gaze turned toward Lee Gwak.

Because it was Lee Gwak who had convened this gathering.

Not only Namgoong In, but even Sa Yeon-hee and Mok Seon-wol looked at Lee Gwak with questioning eyes.

After observing them for a moment, Lee Gwak finally opened his mouth.

“The reason I have gathered everyone here like this is to establish a clear system. While the Celestial Demon Troupe has built an efficient system that commands its martial artists with perfect uniformity, we lack a proper command structure and cannot respond effectively. To break through this difficult situation, we too must have a unified command structure like theirs.”

“That is correct.”

“I believe Master Lee’s words are right.”

As soon as Lee Gwak finished speaking, Namgoong In and Sa Yeon-hee gave positive answers. And before Lee Gwak could even respond, Mok Seon-wol stood up from her seat and said,

“I also believe Master Lee’s words are correct. Therefore, I propose we establish a temporary alliance system. And I nominate Master Lee as the leader of this new alliance.”

“I also agree.”

“I too believe it is right for Master Lee to take the position of alliance leader.”

In response to Mok Seon-wol’s proposal, Sa Yeon-hee and Namgoong In immediately agreed. Then, the leaders of the small and medium-sized factions, who had been watching the mood, all voiced the same opinion, saying. “We support hero Lee”

“Who else but Master Lee could become the alliance leader? I agree.”

“I also believe Master Lee should lead us.”

“I agree.”

There was not a single dissenting opinion.

Everyone gathered in the main hall nominated Lee Gwak as the alliance leader.

Lee Gwak bit his lip slightly.

He had never expected such blind trust from so many.

Their expectations weighed heavily on his shoulders, but Lee Gwak shook off the burden and spoke.

“I am simply grateful that so many of you nominate me as the leader. Given the circumstances, I cannot refuse out of mere courtesy. I will become the alliance leader.

“We thank you for your decisive decision.”

“We sincerely thank you for making this difficult decision in these hard times.”

“Congratulations, Alliance Leader!”

Many people came to offer their congratulations to Lee Gwak.

They genuinely thought it was a good thing that he had become the leader.

To navigate through turbulent times, a leader with strong martial prowess was needed. And above all Lee Gwak not only possessed profound martial arts but also had the powerful Mad Martial Sect behind him.

Furthermore, he was upright and righteous, and would never abandon principle for personal gain.

In many ways, he was a figure without shortcomings to become the central point of the alliance.

Thus, Lee Gwak unanimously became the leader of the new alliance.

The first thing he did after being nominated was to name the alliance.

“I will name our alliance the ‘Heavenly Justice Alliance’, and it will operate only temporarily until we defeat the Celestial Demon Troupe.”

Everyone was surprised by Lee Gwak’s declaration.

The name ‘Heavenly Justice Alliance’ was one thing, but Lee Gwak’s statement that the alliance, formed with such difficulty, would operate only temporarily was shocking.

Usually, once a union or alliance was formed, it operated for at least several decades; that had been the convention.

The recently destroyed Jade Heaven Alliance was a good example.

Even after defeating the Celestial Demon Troupe, the Jade Heaven Alliance was not dissolved and continued operating until it was forcibly dissolved by the Celestial Demon Troupe over a hundred years later.

Most alliances that had existed in the Jianghu had been like that.

It was the convention until now, and many people had considered it natural. But Lee Gwak outright denied that convention.

Everyone was at a loss for words due to Lee Gwak’s shocking declaration.

It might have been just a polite thing to say, but one could tell from Lee Gwak’s resolute eyes that he meant it.

The leaders of the small sects couldn’t understand Lee Gwak’s decision, but Namgung In, Sa Yeon-hee, and Mok Seon-wol, who knew Lee Gwak well, didn’t find it strange at all.

Lee Gwak was originally that kind of person.

He was someone who valued personal peace and time with family more than fame or power.

To him, the position of alliance leader was merely a painful seat that could bring him no satisfaction. However, Lee Gwak took the position because he was the only one who could be the central figure.

Namgung In and Mok Seon-wol were already overwhelmed just managing their own sects, and Sa Yeon-hee didn’t have particularly high recognition.

Ultimately, the Jianghu was a place led by the powerful and the renowned.

Lee Gwak was the only person suited to lead the Heavenly Justice Alliance.

“We welcome the Alliance Leader’s decision.”

“If the Alliance Leader says so…”

Starting with Namgung In, the warriors gathered in the great hall rose one by one and offered a martial salute to Lee Gwak.

Thus, the Heavenly Justice Alliance was founded—a coalition destined to be remembered in Jianghu history as the shortest-lived alliance ever.
