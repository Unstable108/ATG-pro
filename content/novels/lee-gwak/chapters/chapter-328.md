Lee Gwak’s eyes were bloodshot.

In the distance, he could see his wife and daughter crying from their wounds, a sight that completely swept away his rationality.

Thud!

With just two steps, Lee Gwak closed the distance between him and Je Mu-hyeok.

“Lee Gwak!”

Je Mu-hyeok shouted angrily, unleashing a powerful strike towards Lee Gwak.

A mere brush with this attack would mean a lethal blow, but Lee Gwak dodged it with a slight twist of his waist.

Boom!

A loud explosion resounded from behind him.

The fist qi that missed Lee Gwak had smashed into the ground.

Dust clouds rose behind him, engulfing Lee Gwak, but he did not even blink.

Swoosh!

His blade aimed straight for Je Mu-hyeok’s throat.

It wasn’t Lee Gwak’s style to initiate such lethal attacks, but the anger filling his chest made him reckless.

Clang!

Je Mu-hyeok defended himself with a counter-move.

Both of his hands were already glowing a fierce red.

He had unleashed the Red Blood Hands, a powerful technique that made his hands as hard as steel, with power rivaling any divine weapon.

Clash!

Lee Gwak’s blade collided with Je Mu-hyeok’s Red Blood Hands.

The two exchanged blows for thirty seconds in the blink of an eye.

Han So Cheon was able to keep track of their movements, while Lee Soo-ah couldn’t even tell who was Lee Gwak and who was Je Mu-hyeok.

“Cheong and Daddy’s here.”

Lee Soo-ah wiped her tears with her sleeve.

Relief brought a fresh flood of tears. She wiped them away, only for her sleeve to become soaked again.

Just then, a small mouse scurried up behind her, the Demon Spirit Rat.

The Demon Spirit Rat targeted Lee Soo-ah’s neck. However, Han So Cheon and Lee Soo-ah were too preoccupied with the fight to notice.

The Demon Spirit Rat silently advanced and pounced towards her neck.

“Watch out!”

At that moment, an urgent voice rang out, and someone jumped in. He plunged a dagger into the tiny body of the Demon Spirit Rat that was lunging at Lee Soo-ah.

“Cheong-ah!”

Han So Cheon and Lee Soo-ah brightened at the sight of the figure.

It was none other than Lee Cheong, who had driven his blade into the Demon Spirit Rat.

Stab! Stab!

Even in such a state, the Demon Spirit Rat still snapped its teeth, attempting to bite Lee Cheong, displaying a terrifying vitality.

Squelch!

Finally, Lee Cheong drove his blade in deeper, and the Demon Spirit Rat stopped moving.

“Mom! Sister!”

Only then did Lee Cheong look towards Han So Cheon and Lee Soo-ah.

Lee Soo-ah smiled brightly.

“You came!”

“Sorry I’m late. Are you okay?”

Only then did Lee Cheong look towards Han So Cheon and Lee Soo-ah.

Lee Soo-ah smiled brightly.

“You came!”

“Sorry I’m late. Are you okay?”

Lee Cheong approached Lee Soo-ah apologetically.

His face was flushed from sprinting the entire way to follow Lee Gwak. He was panting, his heart threatening to burst, but he forced himself to look calm.

Lee Soo-ah lightly punched Lee Cheong in the chest.

“You should have come sooner. I almost died.”

“Sorry! I did my best, please forgive me for this once.”

“I forgive you.”

“Thank you!”

Lee Cheong then comforted Lee Soo-ah with a pat on the shoulder and looked towards Han So Cheon.

“Mom!”

“You finally made it.”

“I’m glad I wasn’t late. Phew!”

Lee Cheong breathed a sigh of relief.

Han So Cheon opened her arms to him. Without hesitation, Lee Cheong went into her embrace.

“Mom!”

“You’re the one who brought your father here, right?”

“Yes!”

“How did you know we’d be here?”

“There was no other place. When I checked the map, this was the only location where you could fight using your skills at an advantage.”

“Knew it…”

Han So Cheon hugged Lee Cheong even tighter.

She had expected that Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong would recognize the battlefield she chose. She was simply grateful that Lee Cheong understood her intention and brought Lee Gwak here.

“Phew!”

Han So Cheon exhaled a sigh of relief.

She was battered from fighting Je Mu-hyeok, but she no longer felt any fear.

Her battle was over.

Now it was Lee Gwak’s turn to take over.

Han So Cheon watched the fight between Lee Gwak and Je Mu-hyeok with her children in her arms.

Boom!

A massive explosion erupted, devastating the area.

Je Mu-hyeok’s martial prowess was truly terrifying.

From the moment Lee Gwak appeared, Je Mu-hyeok had given his all.

The Thirteen Explosive Flames, a secret technique of Heaven and Earth Sect, unfolded from his hands.

Rumble!

Each time he launched one of the Thirteen Explosive Flames, it was as if lightning struck, devastating the area.

No one would believe that such power could come from a human hand.

But for Je Mu-hyeok, it was a welcome turn of events.

Killing Lee Gwak’s wife and child was one thing, but taking Lee Gwak’s life instead would serve Go Geom Wol even better.

“You think you are Go Geom Wol’s match? I can’t accept that.”

With a powerful shout, Je Mu-hyeok unleashed the final strike of the Thirteen Explosive Flames—the Mad Dragon Blow.

Whoosh!

A fist force rotating with terrifying speed bore down on Lee Gwak’s temple. When Lee Gwak narrowly dodged, Je Mu-hyeok’s elbow followed.

A continuous chain of punches, elbows, shoulders, and body strikes was the essence of the Mad Dragon Blow.

Only one person, Go Geom Wol, had ever survived this barrage of blows. Everyone else was crushed like meat and lost their lives.

Je Mu-hyeok thought this time would be no different.

After three years of intense training, his Mad Dragon Blow had become sharper and more terrifying.

The very air around was torn apart by his Mad Dragon Blow, focusing all its destructive power on Lee Gwak.

At that moment, Lee Gwak swung his sword.

Swoosh!

With a chilling sound of cleaving air, a fountain of blood erupted from Je Mu-hyeok’s elbow. His arm, hardened to the strength of steel, was now cut so deeply that bone was visible.

Je Mu-hyeok ground his teeth.

Despite the unexpected injury, the Mad Dragon Blow was not yet finished. The shoulder and torso attacks were still to come.

As Je Mu-hyeok pulled back his elbow and charged with his shoulder, Lee Gwak swiftly dropped and spun, dodging the attack.

Thud!

His blade pierced Je Mu-hyeok’s foot, nailing it deep into the ground.

“Argh!”

The intense pain from the piercing made Je Mu-hyeok scream involuntarily.

The Mad Dragon Blow, which required dynamic movement for its full effect, was now rendered ineffective with his foot immobilized.

Lee Gwak stood up, leaving the blade impaled in Je Mu-hyeok’s foot.

“You?”

Je Mu-hyeok’s eyes reddened with rage.

Unable to perform the Thirteen Explosive Flames, he still had his Red Blood Hands left.

He spread his Red Blood Hands to split Lee Gwak’s skull.

Snap!

However, his strike was blocked by Lee Gwak’s leaf hand blade.

“You bastard!”

Je Mu-hyeok glowered with murderous rage.

He thought Lee Gwak was insulting him.

Everyone knew Lee Gwak’s prized skill was his blade techniques. Yet now Lee Gwak had set aside his blade and was meeting him barehanded.

To Je Mu-hyeok, it was an outright insult.

“How dare you fight me barehanded? You’ll regret this.”

Je Mu-hyeok mustered all his power and unleashed the Red Blood Hands once more.

Harder than steel, his hands struck at all of Lee Gwak’s vital pressure points. In response, Lee

Gwak used his leaf-hand blade.

Tatatatata!

The Red Blood Hands and the leaf-hand blade collided repeatedly with a sound like bamboo splitting.

Their hands met and parted dozens of times.

Je Mu-hyeok intended to break Lee Gwak’s hands in one go, but with each clash, the damage piled up in Je Mu-hyeok’s own hands.

“This… can’t… be!”

Snap!

Suddenly, a chilling sound rang out, and Je Mu-hyeok’s wrist dangled uselessly. The

accumulated force had finally broken it.

Je Mu-hyeok’s face contorted in disgust.

He might have been unaware of other martial arts, but he had always prided himself as the best in bare-handed combat, and now that pride was shattered.

“You?”

Crack!

At that moment, Lee Gwak’s Leaf hand blade fiercely struck Je Mu-hyeok’s collarbone.

The solid collar bone shattered instantly, delivering tremendous pain, but Lee Gwak’s assault had just begun.

Tatatatatat!

Lee Gwak’s Leaf hand blade pummeled Je Mu-hyeok’s entire body at a terrifying speed invisible to the eye.

Ribs snapped; the bones in his forearm broke through his flesh and jutted out.

Crack!

A gruesome sound burst from Je Mu-hyeok’s neck, and his internal organs were crushed.

Je Mu-hyeok’s body shook violently like a reed in the wind. Yet he did not collapse. Lee Gwak’s leaf hand blade was propping him up, keeping his body from falling apart.

“Grrrgh!”

A grotesque groan escaped Je Mu-hyeok’s lips.

He was overwhelmed by a pain worse than death itself.

Je Mu-hyeok was being destroyed, bit by bit.

His flesh and his spirit were both being utterly annihilated by Lee Gwak.

This was no martial duel.

This was not Lee Gwak’s usual way.

No matter who his opponent might be, Lee Gwak had always fought with all his might and upheld courtesy.

He believed that was the minimum courtesy owed to anyone living in the Jianghu.

And yet now he was unleashing unspeakable violence on Je Mu-hyeok, who no longer had the strength to defend himself.

This was an act of pure rage.

It was Lee Gwak’s vengeance for Han So Cheon and Lee Soo-ah, who had been hounded in his absence and placed in mortal danger.

Had he arrived even a moment too late, Han So Cheon and Lee Soo-ah would no longer be of this world.

The thought that he might have lost his most precious treasures forever stoked an uncontainable fury, welling up from the depths of his heart.

Perhaps his wife and daughter would not have wanted such a brutal vengeance. But it no longer mattered.

This was what Lee Gwak’s heart demanded.

Tap-tap-tap-tap-tap!

Lee Gwak’s leaf hand blade struck again and again, exploding onto Je Mu-hyeok’s body.

Je Mu-hyeok’s consciousness began to fade.

‘This… monstrous… He was right… I should… have fled…’

He regretted not heeding Jin Woo-seon’s warning.

That was the last thought he had in life.

At some point, his consciousness abruptly vanished, and utter darkness claimed him.

Only then did Lee Gwak let Je Mu-hyeok go.

Thud!

Je Mu-hyeok’s body collapsed like a sandcastle.

The body sprawled on the ground had long lost its human shape.

Lee Gwak steadied his rough breathing and looked at the carnage he had created.

The sight of Je Mu-hyeok, crushed like meat, was horrifying enough to appear in nightmares.

Lee Gwak picked up the blade still embedded in Je Mu-hyeok’s foot and the scabbard lying on the ground.

“Sigh!”

He sighed softly as he sheathed the sword.

Suddenly, regret washed over him.

He was afraid of showing this monstrous side of himself that lay hidden deep within his heart to his most beloved family.

He feared turning around and seeing them look at him with eyes filled with terror.

Although Lee Gwak feared nothing in the world, the thought of his beloved family looking at him with fear was unbearable.

Thus, he couldn’t easily turn around.

Rustle! Rustle!

As he hesitated to turn back, someone approached him.

Just the sound of the swishing hem was enough to tell who it was.

Han So Cheon!’

Without turning back, Lee Gwak felt Han So Cheon’s warm touch around his waist.

Han So Cheon had embraced him from behind.

“Han So Cheon!”

Lee Gwak touched Han So Cheon’s white hand as he spoke.

At that moment, Han So Cheon’s warm voice reached him.

“Oraboni.”

“…”

“Sorry! For worrying you.”

“…”

“Thank you! For coming.”

There was no fear in her voice directed towards Lee Gwak.

Finally, encouraged, Lee Gwak cautiously turned around.

Han So Cheon was smiling at him.

Lee Gwak’s worries were unfounded.

No matter what he looked like, Han So Cheon didn’t care. She knew that everything he did was for her and their children.

“Waaah! Daddy!”

Belatedly, Lee Soo-ah burst into tears and ran towards him.

Lee Gwak extended his arms to embrace Lee Soo-ah.

Lee Soo-ah, crying, pounded Lee Gwak’s chest with her little fists.

“I hate you! Why did you come so late? Waaah!”
