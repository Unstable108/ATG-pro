The blade cried out.

The resonance that began with the blade spread throughout Lee Gwak’s entire body.

As if becoming one with the blade, Lee Gwak shared all its sensations.

He could vividly feel the wind brushing past the blade and even the dust settling on it.

The formidable energy of Tyrannical Sea Annihilating Kill was advancing.

In the midst of this overwhelming energy that could engulf everything, Lee Gwak saw a single divergent flow.

His blade, filled with intent, plunged into this current.

It sounded as if a piece of silk was being torn, the sound was so sharp and eerie that people felt as if their own bodies were being cut.

Woo Mun Pae was equally shocked.

The Tyrannical Sea Annihilating Kill he unleashed was something even a master would find hard to break.

In fact, he had never lost a battle after deploying this technique.

Even the most skilled masters would panic at the moment the Tyrannical Sea Annihilating Kill was unleashed, either trying to dodge or deflect the energy, but no one had ever dared to charge head-on.

At first, he thought Lee Gwak was crazy. But when he saw his technique split in two and flow to the sides, he couldn’t help but be astonished.

Lee Gwak’s blade pierced through the Tyrannical Sea Annihilating Kill and suddenly appeared right in front of Woo Mun Pae’s nose.

Had it not been for his superhuman reflexes and physical abilities, allowing him to swiftly turn his head, his neck would have been severed from his body and rolled on the ground. Sweat ran down his spine.

Since becoming the heir to Yu Mun Sang.

Since becoming a member of the Ten Lesser Skies.

Since being called the Mad Dragon, this was the first time he had felt a threat to his life.

A profound sense of crisis that he might die.

Cha-hahat!

Woo Mun Pae unleashed a series of ultimate techniques from the Blue Sea Thousand Wave Fist in rapid succession

The platform completely collapsed, and the air exploded, bursting out in all directions. Yet, no matter what technique was deployed, Lee Gwak cut through it all, relentlessly advancing towards him.

A killing intent radiated from his blade.

A resolve to kill at all costs.

The will contained within Lee Gwak’s ordinary gaze was terrifyingly intense.

For the first time, Woo Mun Pae felt fear.

The thought that he might actually die crossed his mind.

No matter how much he repelled the attacks, Lee Gwak’s blade kept aiming for his throat, returning time and again.

It was as if the blade was possessed.

A burning pain shot through his shoulder as a fountain of blood erupted; Lee Gwak had landed a hit with his blade.

Woo Mun Pae screamed and unleashed his protective qi.

At that moment, Lee Gwak’s blade pierced through the space, aiming directly at him.

It was a deadly stab.

Woo Mun Pae’s protective qi clashed with Lee Gwak’s blade.

People thought Lee Gwak’s blade would bounce off the protective qi. But contrary to their expectations, the blade pierced through Woo Mun Pae’s qi as if it were tofu

“How can this be…”

The moment Woo Mun Pae’s disbelieving eyes widened, Lee Gwak’s blade pierced just below his collarbone, at the upper part of his chest.

Woo Mun Pae, pierced by the blade, crashed into a wall.

His mouth opened wide, spewing out blood.

The blood spilled by Woo Mun Pae splattered onto his chest and Lee Gwak’s face.

Lee Gwak did not move, his sword embedded in Woo Mun Pae’s chest. Like a fish speared on a harpoon, Woo Mun Pae couldn’t move an inch.

Weakly, Woo Mun Pae lifted his head to look at Lee Gwak.

At that moment, Woo Mun Pae truly faced the dense killing intent contained within Lee Gwak’s seemingly ordinary gaze for the first time.

Known as the Mad Dragon, who feared nothing in the world, Woo Mun Pae’s body trembled.

The layered and condensed killing intent was something Woo Mun Pae was encountering for the first time.

As Lee Gwak tightened his grip on the blade, the blade sliced further into Woo Mun Pae’s body.

Hearing the sound of his own flesh and life being torn apart was a chilling experience. Woo Mun Pae shuddered.

Even at that moment, Lee Gwak’s blade burrowed deeper.

Though he had narrowly avoided a fatal wound, if the injury worsened, it would be difficult to recover completely.

Woo Mun Pae bit his lip hard enough to bleed.

Throughout, Lee Gwak remained silent.

There was no triumphant expression of a victor, nor any words urging surrender. He simply drove the blade deeper.

That made it even more terrifying.

The expressionless face, the emotionless eyes.

Lee Gwak was truly intent on killing him.

“I… I have lost.”

The words Woo Mun Pae loathed more than death itself spilled from his lips.

The moment he acknowledged defeat, Lee Gwak’s gaze changed. The killing intent vanished without a trace, returning to his usual expression.

After briefly observing Woo Mun Pae’s face, Lee Gwak sighed softly and withdrew his blade.

A torrent of blood gushed from the wound where the blade had been.

Woo Mun Pae hastily pressed on his acupuncture points to stop the bleeding. Despite his efforts, blood continued to seep out, staining his chest and abdomen red.

Yet, what tormented Woo Mun Pae more than the pain was the fact that he had been defeated by Lee Gwak.

And that he had admitted defeat himself.

Today marked the most humiliating day in Woo Mun Pae’s life.

For the first time, Woo Mun Pae didn’t know how to react to defeat. The people inside the Cheong family estate felt the same way.

Silence enveloped everyone.

They didn’t know how to start a conversation after witnessing such an unbelievable scene.

They had witnessed something that should never have happened.

Watching a man destined to become a legend fall was not a pleasant experience.

It was unpleasant, frightening, and repulsive.

So, they just looked at each other.

Cheongunbi let out a deep sigh.

His face was a mix of complicated emotions.

If possible, he too wanted to remain silent.

Until Lee Gwak challenged Woo Mun Pae, Cheongunbi had merely thought it was the rashness of a young martial artist.

Even if there was a struggle, he naturally assumed Woo Mun Pae would win. However, the unexpected victory of Lee Gwak complicated matters.

He had allowed this fight to create a slightly awkward situation for Woo Mun Pae and deflate his arrogance, not for Woo Mun Pae to suffer defeat in front of everyone.

He was at a loss on how to resolve the situation.

But someone had to manage it, and that responsibility fell to Cheongunbi, the host of the birthday celebration.

“The victor is Master Lee Gwak.”

No one cheered or applauded his declaration.

They were all watching Woo Mun Pae, who was hanging his head in a sense of defeat.

Although Lee Gwak was the winner, Martial Sword Troupe backed Woo Mun Pae. No one in the Jianghu could afford to disregard the Martial Sword Troupe.

In the suffocating silence, only the sound of Lee Gwak sheathing his blade resonated clearly.

It was then that Lee Gwak turned around.

“Lee Gwak!”

Woo Mun Pae, who had been silent until now, suddenly called out to Lee Gwak with wide-open eyes.

His eyes were bloodshot, almost as if blood would drip from them.

As Lee Gwak turned around, Woo Mun Pae gritted his teeth and said, “Today, I lost, Lee Gwak. But my defeat does not equate to the defeat of the Martial Sword Troupe.”

“Of course.”

“Although I lost today, I will master the Blue Sea Thousand Wave Fist to its fullest and challenge you again. Until then, do not lose. To anyone…”

“I understand.”

Lee Gwak responded calmly.

“Do not lose… ever.”

Woo Mun Pae wiped the blood trickling from his mouth with his sleeve and straightened up.

Despite suffering a humiliating defeat in front of everyone, he refused to show a pitiful state.

He exited the stage with his back straight.

Lee Gwak bowed to Cheongunbi, apologizing, “I’m sorry for ruining Master Cheongunbi’s birthday celebration. The platform has been damaged…”

“Not at all! A broken platform can always be rebuilt, but witnessing such a rare event is hard to come by in a lifetime. I’ve indeed broadened my horizons. However…”

“Please, go on.”

Cheongunbi hesitated, and Lee Gwak responded with a composed face. Cheongunbi then lowered his voice and spoke cautiously.

“From now on, you must be very careful. Fortunately, Master Woo acknowledged his defeat, but the Martial Sword Troupe may not see it the same way.”

Lee Gwak understood Cheongunbi’s words.

Woo Mun Pae might accept it as his personal defeat, but the Martial Sword Troupe could perceive Woo Mun Pae’s defeat as a loss for the entire sect.

In such a case, the problem could escalate.

Moreover, due to issues related to the Nine Shadows Fleet, Lee Gwak was already entangled with them.

Although they might not publicize the problem and let it go for now, eventually, once internal issues are resolved, they will undoubtedly hold Lee Gwak responsible for this incident.

“I will take master Cheongunbi’s advice to heart.”

“I would like to have a drink with you all night if I could, but it seems I cannot due to the circumstances. I sincerely hope that fortune will be with you on your journey.”

“I appreciate just the thought.”

After bowing with his fists in front of him to Cheongunbi once more, Lee Gwak turned around.

As he walked away, people respectfully made way for him.

In the eyes of those looking at Lee Gwak, there was a mix of awe and distrust.

They dared not speak to Lee Gwak and only watched him.

Suddenly, Lee Gwak stopped in his tracks.

It seemed he had forgotten something.

That’s when it happened.

‘Brother!’

Only then did he remember what he had forgotten.

Cheol Gwang Woo was running towards him with heavy steps. His clothes were completely torn and worn out.

This was because, while Lee Gwak was fighting the Woo Mun Pae, Cheol Gwang Woo had also been dueling with Gu Ok-rin.

The result was a draw.

He hadn’t won, but he hadn’t lost either.

Gu Ok-rin was a renowned martial artist in the Jianghu.

Her martial arts were based on light movements, so she naturally had to be swift

Cheol Gwang Woo could not keep up with her movements. Gu Ok-rin was always one step quicker in her attacks.

Cheol Gwang Woo endured her attacks with his body while advancing. He was determined to split her in two if he could just catch her, but the problem was that she was uncatchable.

However, it wasn’t that Gu Ok-rin had completely taken the upper hand either.

Her sword was sharp, but it could not even scratch Cheol Gwang Woo’s body, even with her sword qi.

The more Gu Ok-rin attacked, the more wildly Cheol Gwang Woo fought back. She was so taken aback that she forgot to attack at times.

Eventually, when Woo Mun Pae was defeated by Lee Gwak, Gu Ok-rin also chose to retreat.

‘If we had more time, I would have definitely broken her spine.’

Cheol Gwang Woo expressed his regret.

His eyes still flickered with madness.

It was fortunate that Gu Ok-rin retreated before his madness became uncontrollable; otherwise, not only she but also the people around them would have suffered greatly from his fury.

Lee Gwak said to Cheol Gwang Woo,

‘Let’s go.’

‘Yes! Brother.’

With a booming response, Cheol Gwang Woo followed behind Lee Gwak.

As they disappeared outside the Cheong family’s estate, people finally exhaled the breath they had been holding and began murmuring.

“My goodness! To see the Mad Dragon fall.”

“It feels like we’ve just had a dream. It wasn’t a dream, was it?”

The voices of the people filled the inside of the Cheong Family’s estate.

Cheongunbi murmured as he looked in the direction where Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo had disappeared.

“To think that the Mad Dragon has fallen. Truly a terrifying bladesman has appeared. If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I would never have believed it.”

The excitement and chills throughout his body had not yet subsided.

This kind of excitement was something he hadn’t felt since he earned the nickname ‘Righteous Wanderer’

“Using the blade like a ghost, how many among the young martial artists could stand against him?”.
