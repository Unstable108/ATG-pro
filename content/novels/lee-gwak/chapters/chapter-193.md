As the size of Jade Heaven Alliance expanded, so did the organization of its four courts. If one were to point out the area that grew the most outwardly, it would undoubtedly be the Outer Court.

Within the Outer Court, the Outer Hall saw a noticeable increase in personnel.

Originally, the Outer Hall was composed of thirteen squads, but it now operated with nearly double that number—twenty-five teams.

Naturally, the staff had almost doubled, but the support they received had not changed significantly. As a result, the life of the martial artists in the Outer Hall remained much the same as before. Instead, their workload multiplied.

They were responsible for a wide range of tasks, including external patrols, maintaining the security of the outer walls and assisting other organizations that were short of manpower.

Given these circumstances, only about half of the twenty-five squads in the Outer Hall could focus on their primary duties, while the rest were mobilized for various events and miscellaneous tasks.

“Phew! I thought I was going to die of exhaustion.”

“Using the outer hall to build mechanisms. Are they crazy? We almost turned into a beehive.”

“I can handle anything else, but supporting the Creation Pavilion is just impossible. Insane!”

The martial artists from the 17th vented their complaints as soon as they returned to their quarters.

Their faces were filled with fatigue, indicating how challenging this support mission had been.

While other support missions were somewhat manageable, helping the Creation Pavilion was too strenuous, and everyone avoided it.

This time, the Creation Pavilion had conducted a comprehensive inspection of the mechanisms installed in the Jade Heaven Alliance. Due to the expansion of the Alliance, many new mechanisms had been installed.

Initially, they thought they would only be handling menial tasks. However, the Creation Pavilion expected more. They mobilized the 17th for precise operations.

Mobilizing the 17th for such dangerous tasks, where a single misstep could activate the mechanisms and lead to everyone’s demise, was risky.

Naturally, their nerves were on edge, and their hands and feet trembled, making it difficult to do their jobs properly. Eventually, the squad leader protested, and only then were they reassigned to menial tasks.

The squad members expressed their gratitude to the squad leader.

“Phew! squad leader, you’ve worked hard. If it weren’t for you, we would have definitely been crushed by the mechanisms.”

“From now on, let’s reject all support requests from the Creation Pavilion. The work is hard and we don’t even get recognised.

The squad leader silently listened to their complaints.

Accepting all the grievances of the squad members was also part of the squad leader’s role. He thought it wasn’t too bad if it could relieve even a bit of their frustration.

Then, one of the squad members asked him.

“Is that true? There was once a member of the outer hall who was an expert in mechanisms. If such a person existed, why was he in the outer hall and not at the Creation Pavilion? Those bastards! At least make a lie believable.”

“There was.”

“Excuse me?”

“There was such a person…”

“Eh! squad leader. What kind of—”

One of the Squad members, who was about to reply, suddenly shut his mouth. He sensed something serious in the squad leader’s demeanor and eyes.

Noticing his leader’s mood, the squad member coughed awkwardly and stepped back.

Left alone, the squad leader shook his head and muttered.

“Seriously! What would those guys know? They know nothing. Sigh!”

He even let out a sigh.

He sat down on the flat stone bench and looked up at the sky, revealing his face in the sunlight.

His skin was darkened by the sun, his face filled with fine wrinkles, and he wore an expression full of worry—a middle-aged man.

He was Seok Yi Cheon.

He had moved from the 13th squad, where Lee Gwak had been the leader, to become the leader of the 17th squad.

“Each and every one of them has nothing but complaints. That’s why I never wanted to be a leader… Damn it all!”

When the Outer Hall expanded from 13 to 25 squads, he was promoted to squad leader due to the sudden increase in personnel and the lack of candidates for leadership roles.

It wasn’t just Seok Yi Cheon. Other members also scattered, becoming captains or vice-captains of other squads.

They were completely isolated, forbidden from interacting or communicating with each other. At first glance, they appeared to live freely, but in reality, they were trapped behind invisible bars.

Seok Yi Cheon was under strict surveillance.

Someone among the 17th squad was tasked with monitoring him, though he didn’t know who exactly.

The situation was the same for the others. Those who had been in the 13th squad were all under invisible surveillance, forcing them to be more cautious in their actions.

“I should have left with Ki Jin Hwi.”

Six years ago, when they escaped from the Celestial Demon Troupe and arrived near the Jade Heaven Alliance, Ki Jin Hwi had told the members of the 13th squad.

If they returned to the Jade Heaven Alliance, they would surely face some form of punishment or even lose their lives. He suggested they should instead leave for the outside world. However, Seok Yi Cheon and the squad members rejected his proposal.

The circumstances of Ki Jin Hwi, who came from outside, were different from those of Seok Yi Cheon and the squad members who had spent their entire lives in the Jade Heaven Alliance.

For Seok Yi Cheon and the others, the Jade Heaven Alliance was their entire world.

They had spent their entire lives in the Jade Heaven Alliance and could not even imagine living outside of it. So they rejected Ki Jin Hwi’s proposal and returned to the Jade Heaven Alliance.

The price they paid was severe.

Though they did not lose their lives, they lost their freedom.

Later, they learned that Yong Cheon Myeong originally intended to kill them all, not wanting to leave anyone who knew his secrets alive. But Seo Jong Myeong opposed it, and even Lim Sobo from the Secret Court advocated for the 13th squad, forcing a compromise at a reasonable level.

Seok Yi Cheon let out a deep sigh.

At times like these, he missed Lee Gwak terribly. The time he spent with him was the most enjoyable of his life.

At that moment, the youngest member of the squad called out to him.

“squad leader!”

“What is it?”

“The Dark Moon Pavilion is summoning you.”

“Dark Moon Pavilion?”

Seok Yi Cheon’s brow furrowed deeply.

Dark Moon Pavilion was a subsidiary building of Celestial Palace, owned by Yong Cheon Myeong. It had a notorious reputation, making it the last place anyone would want to visit.

“Damn it!”

“Hurry and go. If you’re late, the master of Dark Moon Pavilion will be angry.”

Seok Yi Cheon let out another deep sigh.

The master of Dark Moon Pavilion was a close confidant of Yong Cheon Myeong. Since he did all kinds of dirty work for Yong Cheon Myeong, his authority was formidable. So much so that even the Master of the Outer Court, Geum Gu Ho, would defer to him.

A mere squad leader of the outer hall was no match for him.

Seok Yi Cheon mustered his strength and got up.

He was heading towards the Celestial Palace, the location of the Dark Moon Pavilion, like a cow being led to the slaughterhouse. The Dark Moon Pavilion was in a remote corner of the Celestial Palace, so one had to go through the Celestial Palace to get there.

He passed through several checkpoints to stand before the master of the Dark Moon Pavilion.

“You called… for me?”

“You came because I called, didn’t you?”

“Yes. That was a foolish question on my part.”

Seok Yi Cheon bowed his head at the brusque and cold words of the Master of the Dark Moon Pavilion. His posture was almost submissive, but there was not a hint of hesitation in Seok Yi Cheon’s bow.

A smirk appeared on the face of the master of Dark Moon Pavilion as he looked at Seok Yi Cheon. It was a clear mockery.

Seok Yi Cheon was aware of it. Yet, he did not show any sign of displeasure.

He was facing the master of Dark Moon Pavilion.

A single word from him could end not only his life, but the lives of everyone in the 17th Squad.

No matter how unpleasant or humiliating, he had to endure and endure again.

Seok Yi Cheon maintained the utmost polite demeanor. The master of Dark Moon Pavilion watched him for a moment, then suddenly burst into laughter.

“Ha-ha! Just kidding, brother. Our relationship isn’t so formal and awkward, right? Take a seat.”

“No, I prefer to stand.”

“Sit down, I said.”

The master of Dark Moon Pavilion’s voice turned cold for a moment.

Quietly, Seok Yi Cheon took his seat. Then, the master of Dark Moon Pavilion grinned.

“It’s so much better when we’re eye to eye, don’t you think?”

“Heh! As always, it’s good how well we understand each other, brother.”

Seok Yi Cheon looked at the master of Dark Moon Pavilion with a powerless gaze.

He was a handsome man with distinct features. Originally, his sharp jawline gave him a robust appearance, but now his face seemed somewhat slimmer and more sinister.

‘Jeon Ok, you’ve really changed a lot. No, maybe this has always been your true nature.’

The master of Dark Moon Pavilion was Go Jeon-ok.

Once a martial artist in the outer hall alongside Seok Yi Cheon, he rose to become one of Yong Cheon Myeong’s closest confidants, eventually rising to the position of Master of the Dark Moon Pavilion.

He had achieved the success he had always desired.

Go Jeon-ok’s personality changed after becoming the master of Dark Moon Pavilion.

He would not hesitate to carry out any cruel task for Yong Cheon Myeong and did not mind earning the resentment of others. The number of people who had died at his and Dark Moon Pavilion’s hands exceeded hundreds.

As a result, many people feared him even more than Yong Cheon Myeong himself.

Whatever martial arts Go Jeon-ok had learnt since becoming one of Yong Cheon Myeong’s closest confidants, his gaze was cold and menacing, instilling fear in those who met his eyes.

Seok Yi Cheon shivered under Go Jeon-ok’s piercing gaze but did not speak first. Go Jeon-ok greatly disliked it when someone of a lower rank initiated the conversation.

“How is the work? The tasks of the outer hall must be quite burdensome, right?”

“No, they are manageable.”

“Hmm! Is that so?”

Go Jeon-ok squinted his eyes.

His gaze resembled that of a snake eyeing its prey, causing Seok Yi Cheon to swallow dryly.

“Brother, have you heard the rumor?”

“Ah, you might not have heard it yet. It’s not official yet.”

“What are you talking about?”

“There’s been a strange rumor in the southern Jianghu, within the domain of the Martial Sword Troupe.”

“What rumor?”

“That the heir of Martial Sword Troupe was defeated by a young martial artist.”

“What? That’s absurd…”

“Right? It sounds unbelievable, doesn’t it? I thought so too—that Young Master Woo Mun Pae, a member of the Ten Lesser Skies, would be defeated by a newcomer. But it turns out to be true.”

“And you know what’s even funnier? The name of the man who defeated the heir of Martial Sword Troupe is said to be Lee Gwak.”

“Lee Gwak?”

Seok Yi Cheon’s eyes wavered.

He hadn’t expected to hear the name Lee Gwak in this place.

Go Jeon-ok, noticing Seok Yi Cheon’s trembling eyes, pressed on.

“The person who defeated Prince Woo Mun Pae, isn’t he the same Lee Gwak we know?”

“That’s impossible. There’s been no word from Lee Gwak for six years… We all thought he was dead, didn’t we?”

“I thought the same. It would be normal to think so. It makes no sense for him to be alive, according to common sense. That’s why I’m confirming it with you.”

“What? Confirming what…”

“Have you ever, even once, received any contact from Lee Gwak?”

“Absolutely not.”

“It’s the truth.”

“Alright. Why are you so tense? Between us… Anyway, if there has been no contact from Lee Gwak, it’s likely that the Lee Gwak who defeated Woo Mun Pae is not the person we know.”

“That seems likely.”

“Got it. You may leave now.”

Go Jeon-ok waved his hand dismissively.

It was a dismissive gesture, as if shooing away a fly, but Seok Yi Cheon dared not challenge him.

He bowed to Go Jeon-ok and then left.

Left alone, Go Jeon-ok muttered to himself.

“Hmp, it seems like I’ve received the news first.”

After tapping his cheek with his finger for a moment, Go Jeon-ok called someone.

“One Kill.”

“Yes! Master.”

Instantly, a shadowy figure appeared and prostrated before him.

“Monitor every move of Seok Yi Cheon. Find out whom he meets and whom he contacts. Report back with detailed information.”

“As you command!”

With that, One Kill disappeared without a trace.

Left alone again, Go Jeon-ok murmured.

“Lee Gwak… It really isn’t you, right? You’re already dead. What a pity. If you were alive, you’d be of more value.”

Go Jeon-ok thought about Gu Mun-hoe.

A man who appeared out of nowhere and became one of Yong Cheon Myeong’s closest confidants.

Because of him, despite doing all the dirty work, Go Jeon-ok could not become the second in command and had to settle for being the third.

Desire was a monster that never knew satisfaction.

Go Jeon-ok had already become a monster himself. ***

‘Lee Gwak.’

Seok Yi cheon, now outside, looked up at the sky with a dazed expression.

He had not expected to hear the name Lee Gwak from Go Jeon-ok, and the emotions swirling within him were intense.

His heart was racing so fiercely it felt as though it might burst from his chest.

From the moment Go Jeon-ok mentioned Lee Gwak, his heart had been pounding violently.

There was no evidence that the Lee Gwak who had defeated Woo Mun Pae was the same Lee Gwak he knew, but his heart and intuition were whispering that they were the same person.

‘If it’s really him, Lee Gwak must not come to Jade Heaven Alliance. This place is crawling with those who would target him.’

Putting aside Yong Cheon Myeong, who had been humiliated by Lee Gwak, even Go Jeon-ok was eyeing Lee Gwak as a means to further his own rise. The number of people who had become sacrifices for Go Jeon-ok’s ambition was too many to count.

‘I must find a way to help Lee Gwak somehow.’
