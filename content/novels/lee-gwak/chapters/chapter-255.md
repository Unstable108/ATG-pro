Clip-clop!

A black ox was pulling a cart full of straw.

‘Yikes! Damn cow, stop staggering and go straight.’

The man grumbling while driving the black ox was none other than Ki Jin-Hwi.

He had bought the ox and cart from a nearby farm at a high price. Sitting on a cushion of soft hay at the back of the cart were Lee Gwak and Han So-cheon.

Han So-Cheon still looked pale.

She had suffered a life-threatening wound that pierced through her chest. Even though the resurrection pill had saved her life, she was as fragile as a vessel on the brink of shattering. Because of this, it was impossible for her to move on her own, which was why they had purchased the ox and cart.

It didn’t matter if they moved slowly. As long as they continued steadily, they would eventually reach Mount Yeosan, where the divine physician could surely heal her.

Lee Gwak steadily channeled his qi into Han So-Cheon’s Mingmen acupoint. This alone made her breathing easier.

Once she had stabilized to some extent, Han So-Cheon spoke up.

“I’m alright now, Oraboni!”

Lee Gwak nodded silently and removed his palm from her Mingmen acupoint. His forehead was covered in beads of sweat.

Since the moment he had rescued her, he hadn’t rested for even a single moment, constantly infusing her with his qi. Even for someone as immensely skilled as Lee Gwak, this was no easy feat.

“Thank you! And I’m sorry.”

“No need to thank me, and there’s no need to apologize. It’s only natural.”

“The children?”

“They’re safe!”

“Cheong too? Do we still need more pills?”

“We don’t need any more pills. He’s fully recovered.”

“Fully recovered?”

Han So-Cheon’s face lit up with disbelief.

Although she trusted Lee Gwak wholeheartedly, this time, it was hard for her to believe.

If the illness had been that easy to cure, she wouldn’t have had to live so miserably under White Light Sect’s care, desperately seeking a way to heal Lee Cheong. She had tried everything.

She sought out every renowned physician, but they all shook their heads in despair. That’s how hopeless Lee Cheong’s condition was.

“There’s no need to comfort me with lies. I’m ready to hear whatever you have to say.”

“It’s not a lie.”

Lee Gwak recounted the journey of how he had met the divine physician. As Han So-Cheon listened, her eyes filled with tears.

“Really…?”

“Everything I’ve said is true. Cheong is completely cured. He just needs the Divine Doctor’s care to regain his strength. The resurrection pill I gave you was also from the divine physician.

“Sob!”

Han So-Cheon burst into tears.

The years of heartache she had endured alone melted away in an instant. She let her tears wash away the last remnants of her pain.

Lee Gwak silently patted her back.

After crying for a long while, Han So-Cheon raised her head, her face streaked with tears.

Lee Gwak gently wiped the remaining tears from her eyes with his fingers.

“You did well. It’s all thanks to you. You raised the children splendidly.”

“I didn’t do anything. They grew up just fine on their own.”

“If it weren’t for you, they wouldn’t have grown up to be who they are. It’s all thanks to you.”

Han So-Cheon almost burst into tears once again at Lee Gwak’s words.

For the past six years, she had missed him intensely and resented him in equal measure.

Her days were a cycle of longing, then resentment, and then longing again. But now that she was with Lee Gwak, all the resentment melted away like snow.

This moment with him felt like a dream. A beautiful dream she was afraid would vanish the moment she blinked.

Lee Gwak smiled warmly at her, and it was in his gaze that Han So-Cheon realized this wasn’t a dream.

At that moment, Ki Jin-Hwi, who had been driving the cart, spoke up.

“How have you been all this time, Leader? How in the world did you manage to master such martial arts in just six years?”

Ki Jin-Hwi’s face was filled with curiosity as he looked back.

Han So-Cheon, though silent, was equally curious.

In just six years, Lee Gwak had reappeared as a completely different person. He himself hadn’t changed, but his martial arts were on another level.

Even for someone born with immense talent, such rapid progress was unheard of. At least, not in his understanding. Which made them all the more curious.

Lee Gwak calmly recounted everything that had happened.

He spoke of how he had saved Han So-Cheon and then been saved by Gwang No-Ya, the trials he faced upon returning to Jianghu, his encounter with Lee Soo-Ah at the Jade Heaven Alliance, and how he had saved Lee Cheong, leaving nothing out.

“Umm!”

“Ah!”

Having heard Lee Gwak’s full story, the two couldn’t help but exclaim.

They prided themselves on having experienced all the highs and lows of life, but they weren’t sure they could handle the tumultuous path Lee Gwak had traveled.

Such was the harshness of Lee Gwak’s life journey.

“Hmph! Leader, you’ve suffered a lot too.”

“And how have you been, brother? You said you found a lead?”

“My story isn’t important now. We’ll discuss it separately when we reach Mount Yeosan. For now, focus on taking care of the young lady.”

“Understood.”

Lee Gwak nodded.

Indeed, caring for Han So-Cheon was the most important thing right now. That was why Ki Jin-Hwi was driving the cart as cautiously as possible.

As a result, the journey to Mount Yeosan was bound to take longer.

Lee Gwak looked down at Han So-Cheon, who had fallen asleep with her head resting on his lap.

Her face was still pale, but a faint smile had appeared on her lips. From time to time, she furrowed her brows, as if dreaming. Even that expression looked beautiful to him.

“You’ve done well.”

Lee Gwak gently stroked her black hair.

It was then.

“Commander!”

Ki Jin-Hwi’s low voice reached him.

When Lee Gwak turned his head, he saw Ki Jin-Hwi pointing forward. Naturally, Lee Gwak’s gaze followed.

A deep crease appeared between his brows.

Standing in their path was a man carrying a massive greatsword on his back.

There was no one in Jianghu who used a sword larger than the Heavenly Slayer Sword. At least, as far as Lee Gwak knew.

Ki Jin-Hwi, sensing the tension, muttered to himself.

“It feels like he’s blocking our path, but that must be my imagination, right?”

It was at that moment.

“Hmph!”

The man suddenly drew his greatsword and swung it with fierce intensity.

Whoosh!

A powerful gust of wind surged toward the cart where Yi Gwak was riding.

Lee Gwak immediately sprang forward, kicking off from the cart.

In his hand, a sword had already been drawn.

Lee Gwak swung his blade at the incoming force.

Boom!

With a thunderous explosion, fragments of the invisible sword qi shattered and scattered in all directions. The unseen sword qi had been broken by Lee Gwak’s blade.

His eyes narrowed.

His hand tingled from the force. That was how intense the opponent’s sword qi was.

The man who had launched the formless sword qi stepped forward and spoke.

“I’ll keep this brief. Leave the woman behind and walk away. If you do, I won’t pursue you.”

“Who are you?”

“And who are you to her?”

“She is my wife.”

“Wife? So, you’re married?”

“That’s right.”

“Then you deserve to die as well.”

Whoosh!

The man swung his greatsword again, launching an even more powerful sword qi.

Lee Gwak’s expression stiffened.

Dodging the sword qi wouldn’t have been difficult, but doing so would mean that the cart, aligned directly behind him, would be struck. It was clear the man was aiming for that vulnerability.

“Sigh!”

Lee Gwak didn’t know the grudge this man had against Han So-Cheon, but he couldn’t stand by and watch.

Ultimately, her enmity was a burden he, too, had to bear.

Swish!

Lee Gwak’s blade sang.

Boom!

A thunderous sound erupted as the sword qi shattered. The impact caused a cloud of dust to rise, obscuring the view.

‘He’s coming.’

Lee Gwak’s eyes shifted to the sky.

Shooo!

Like a meteor, a massive figure was descending toward Lee Gwak. It was the man with the greatsword.

His name was Baek Hwi-Yeong.

He was a martial artist from the Celestial Demon Troupe who had lost his master to Han So-Cheon.

His greatsword descended with killing intent, aiming to cleave Lee Gwak in two.

Clang!

But Baek Hwi-Yeong’s greatsword was stopped by Lee Gwak’s blade.

“How dare you!”

Baek Hwi-Yeong’s eyes flared with rage.

He prided himself on wielding the greatsword, backed by incredible strength and internal energy.

No martial artist had ever been able to withstand the blow of his Heaven-Splitting Moon Sword technique. But Lee Gwak had already blocked it three times.

His pride was wounded.

With his nemesis standing before him, the fact that he was being held back by a lesser bladesman fueled his fury.

“Raaah! I’ll tear you apart!”

With a blood-curdling scream, Baek Hwi-Yeong unleashed his Heaven-Splitting Moon Sword technique.

Boom!

A fierce surge of qi swept in all directions.

The world seemed to darken as everything was shrouded in shadow.

In the midst of this darkness, a large moon appeared. It was the crescent blade qi created by Baek Hwi-Yeong’s greatsword.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The crescent blade energy flew towards Lee Gwak in rapid succession.

Each one carried the power to shatter a boulder into dust.

Lee Gwak sensed the immense force within the sword qi but felt no fear.

Baek Hwi-Yeong was indeed strong.

He possessed a strength that could rival the Ten Lesser Skies of Jianghu. But Lee Gwak was stronger.

The countless battles he had faced on his journey had tempered him, making him even more formidable. To him, Baek Hwi-Yeong’s attack wasn’t particularly threatening.

The real question lingering in Lee Gwak’s mind was why this man was attacking so suddenly. But since Baek Hwi-Yeong wasn’t revealing his reasons, there was no way for him to know.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Lee Gwak’s blade intercepted the incoming crescent qi.

The mighty sword qi was deflected, striking the surrounding landscape.

Massive rocks were cleaved, and towering trees were felled. In an instant, the area was reduced to chaos. Yet the cart carrying Han So-Cheon and Ki Jin-Hwi remained untouched.

Whoosh!

Lee Gwak’s body glided low to the ground, moving towards Baek Hwi-Yeong like a swallow in flight. It was the Revolving Steps.

Swish!

A chilling sound accompanied Lee Gwak’s blade as it targeted Baek Hwi-Yeong’s chest.

“Not so fast!”

Baek Hwi-Yeong intercepted Lee Gwak’s blade with the flat side of his greatsword. Its vast surface acted as a shield.

Clang!

Lee Gwak’s blade struck the greatsword’s blade, but the force reverberated through the handle, delivering the impact directly to Baek Hwi-Yeong.

“Guh!”

Baek Hwi-Yeong let out an involuntary grunt. The force was beyond his imagination.

He was pushed back, his feet carving deep grooves into the ground. He quickly tried to regain his balance and counterattack. But Lee Gwak didn’t give him the chance.

Swish!

The air shredded as Lee Gwak’s blade flew towards him again.

It was blindingly fast.

All Baek Hwi-Yeong could do was use the flat of his greatsword to defend himself once more.

Clang!

The metallic sound rang out, and Baek Hwi-Yeong was pushed back again.

Lee Gwak didn’t let up. His blade relentlessly battered Baek Hwi-Yeong.

Baek Hwi-Yeong could only hide behind the broad side of his greatsword, waiting for a chance to counter.

‘Just a little longer. He’s human too; he can’t keep attacking at full strength forever.’

In this regard, his greatsword was an efficient weapon. Its vast surface made it easy to block most attacks with minimal movement.

Baek Hwi-Yeong, like a turtle hiding in its shell, waited for his opportunity behind the greatsword.

Thud! Clang!

The metallic sounds echoed continuously.

Each time, a powerful shockwave hit Baek Hwi-Yeong, but he gritted his teeth and endured. Finally, the moment he had been waiting for arrived. Lee Gwak’s attacks slowed.

“Chaaargh!”

Baek Hwi-Yeong raised his greatsword high, preparing to unleash the ultimate technique of the Heaven-Splitting Moon Sword.

At that moment.

Crrack!

An ominous sound echoed.

Baek Hwi-Yeong’s eyes widened.

The sound had come from his greatsword.

“What the…?”

Crrack! Crrack!

A crack formed in the center of his greatsword, quickly spreading like a spider’s web across the entire blade.

It was a sword forged by the finest craftsmen of the Celestial Demon Troupe, incredibly durable and able to withstand even fierce clashes with other swords. Seeing such a crack was shocking and terrifying.

“Could it be… he’s been targeting the same spot all along?”

Baek Hwi-Yeong thought the notion was absurd, but it was the truth.

Lee Gwak had continuously struck the exact same spot to break through Baek Hwi-Yeong’s defense.

Crash!

Finally, unable to withstand the accumulated force, Baek Hwi-Yeong’s greatsword shattered into countless pieces.

Amid the scattering fragments, Lee Gwak’s blade flashed.

Thud!

It pierced Baek Hwi-Yeong’s chest as easily as if it were cutting through tofu.

Baek Hwi-Yeong’s eyes widened in disbelief as he felt the foreign object embedded in his chest.

“No!”

A roar echoed from afar. An immense force surged toward Lee Gwak.

Boom!
