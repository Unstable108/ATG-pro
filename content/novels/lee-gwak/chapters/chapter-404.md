The Jeongong Escort Agency had been preparing for departure since dawn.

Soo Goo-san was commanding the head escorts and escort guards to thoroughly inspect the cargo.

With the porters added to the escorts, the rear courtyard of the inn looked as busy as a marketplace, but each member of the agency was diligently handling their assigned tasks.

“Wow!”

Lim Ji-mun, watching from the sidelines, couldn’t help but exclaim.

Just by observing how the members of the Jeongong Escort Agency worked, it was clear how well-disciplined they were. Each person knew their role and carried out their duties with precision.

“Elder Brother really is an amazing person.”

The rapid growth of the Jeongong Escort Agency, despite having been founded only recently, was largely due to Oh Jung-gyeong.

Lim Ji-mun had no doubt that the agency would continue to grow rapidly.

Lee Gwak and Lim Ji-mun had decided to travel together with the Jeongong Escort Agency.

Since their destination was the same, there was no reason to go separately.

Traveling with the agency made the journey much more comfortable for Lee Gwak and Lim Ji-mun, and the escort agency benefited from the added security—it was mutually beneficial.

Lim Jimun smiled softly.

After sharing drinks the previous night, he was certain Oh Jung-gyeong was a good man. Traveling with such a person was a welcome prospect for him as well.

When the escorts finally finished their preparations, head escort Soo Goo-san called out in a loud voice.

“Everyone, stay sharp! Even with Master Lee traveling with us, the cargo is our responsibility. Don’t relax your guard for a moment!”

“Yes, sir!”

“Don’t worry. It’s not like this is our first escort run.”

The head escorts responded energetically.

Their faces were filled with spirit.

Soo Goo-san shouted,

“Move out!”

The moment his command rang out, the Jeongong Escort Agency set off.

They had over ten wagons loaded with goods. The value of the cargo was enough to fund the operations of a decent martial sect for an entire year.

If they lost this cargo, the Jeongong Escort Agency would go bankrupt that very day.

That was why Soo Goo-san’s nerves were on edge.

In contrast, the agency leader Oh Jung-gyeong wore a calm expression.

Naturally, he felt more at ease because Lee Gwak was traveling with them. That didn’t mean he had let his guard down, though.

He was in a state of balanced composure—relaxed yet alert.

Oh Jung-gyeong was riding at the rear of the procession with Lee Gwak and Lim Ji-mun.

Lee Gwak, who had remained silent until now, finally spoke.

“Looks like there are more people this time.”

“That’s right! Thanks to the success of the last escort mission, we had some extra funds. I was able to bring in more trustworthy people.”

“That’s good to hear.”

“It’s all thanks to you.”

“What did I do?”

“The escort guards bragged all over the Jianghu about traveling with you. Hearing that, skilled escort guards came to us. Thanks to that, we were able to recruit many good escorts without much effort.”

Having more skilled escorts was proof of the agency’s growing strength.

A capable agency naturally attracted more clients.

The fact that they had secured this shipment ahead of larger agencies was further evidence that the Jeongong Escort Agency was gaining recognition.

Oh Jung-gyeong felt as though heaven itself was aiding the Jeongong Escort Agency.

Ever since meeting Lee Gwak, everything had been going smoothly.

Though he had been somewhat anxious about going to the Wudang sect, knowing Lee Gwak was accompanying them put his mind at ease.

Soo Goo-san gave Lee Gwak a warm smile.

“If you need anything, just say the word. I’ll get it for you, no matter what.”

“Are you sick? Why are you acting like this?”

“I’m just happy to have you around.”

“I have a wife and children, you know.”

Lee Gwak looked at Oh Jung-gyeong with a teasing expression. Oh Jung-gyeong burst out:

“I like women too!”

“Haha!”

“Pfft!”

Lee Gwak and Lim Ji-mun laughed at Oh Jung-gyeong’s reaction.

Hearing the laughter from the rear, Soo Goo-san turned his head from the front of the group.

‘This is good,’ he thought, a smile forming on his own lips.

He had a good feeling about this trip.

＊＊＊

The journey to Wudang Sect was uneventful.

Since they were moving in a large group, they drew a lot of attention, but such processions were hardly rare in the Jianghu these days.

The Wudang Sect’s opening ceremony was the biggest event to happen in recent times. Countless escort agencies, including the Jeongong Escort Agency, were transporting cargo to Wudang.

While the Jeongong Escort Agency’s cargo was indeed valuable, the cargo carried by other agencies was also worth a fortune.

And it wasn’t just escorts.

People from all over were heading to Mount Wudang.

Some were martial artists from renowned orthodox sects, while others were wandering experts.

This was only possible because it was the Wudang Sect.

Despite having been closed for a hundred years, the name “Wudang” still carried immense weight.

People wanted to see the Wudang Sect with their own eyes as it reopened after a century of seclusion.

Even those not formally invited were making their way to witness the event.

The wudang’s sect opening ceremony was the biggest event in Jianghu.

With the Jianghu having been in chaos for years, people sought solace in such a grand event, and perhaps that’s why so many were drawn to this grand gathering.

The Jeongong Escort Agency traveled diligently.

Fortunately, they encountered no problems on the way and safely reached Dengzhou, which was quite close to Mount Wudang.

“Whew! Now I can finally relax a bit.”

Soo Goo-san wiped the sweat from his brow and muttered.

From Dengzhou to Mount Wudang was only about a hundred li. Once they crossed the large lake in between, they would reach Shiyan, the “outer courtyard” of the Wudang Sect.

According to rumors, Shiyan had been in a festive mood for days in anticipation of the grand reopening.

Descendants of those who had left when the Wudang Sect closed its doors had returned to Shiyan, filling the once-desolate streets with vitality.

The festive atmosphere had even spread to Dengzhou across the lake.

Those unable to enter Shiyan yet were staying in nearby Dengzhou, waiting for the grand reopening. As a result, every inn in Dengzhou was fully booked.

The Jeongong Escort Agency had to go to great lengths to secure rooms—and only after paying a hefty premium.

“Phew! This is like a war.”

Oh Jung-gyeong whistled as he wiped his brow.

Though the extra cost for lodging was a heavy blow, the end of the journey was in sight, so he paid gladly.

Lee Gwak patted his shoulder. “Good work.”

“It was my duty.”

“Thanks to you, we’ll sleep well tonight.”

“I hear the owner here is a fine cook. Especially the ‘water fish’ from the lake—is supposed to be the perfect drinking snack.”

As he spoke, he gestured with his hand. Lee Gwak was not dull enough to miss the meaning of his gesture, and he nodded.

“Then we will have a drink tonight.”

“Let’s wash up first and meet for dinner. I’ll let the innkeeper know in advance.”

“Sure”

Oh Jung‑gyeong turned to Lim Ji-mun. “You’ll drink with us, right?”

“I’ll pass tonight.”

“Hmm?”

Oh Jung‑gyeong looked surprised.

Lim Ji-mun, who never refused alcohol, was turning it down now? After finding every possible excuse to drink on the way here, his refusal was unexpected.

Lim Ji-mun smiled.

“I have things to do.”

“What things?”

“We’re almost at our destination, so it’s time I started earning my keep. Otherwise, my sister will scold me. I might even get kicked out of the Mad Martial Sect.”

“Hmm!”

“Don’t mind me. You two enjoy yourselves. Hehe!”

Lim Ji-mun’s gaze turned to Lee Gwak, who nodded in understanding.

Lim Ji-mun hadn’t traveled with Lee Gwak for no reason.

He was Lim So-bo’s younger brother. Though not as sharp as his sister, he had keen insight.

From now on, he would scout the area, gathering the information Lim So-bo wanted.

While they could obtain intelligence through the Hao clan or other channels, Lim So-bo had specifically asked Lim Ji-mun to gather it himself—proof of her trust in him.

And he was more than capable.

Though he loved wine and always wore a smile, that wasn’t his true self.

His real worth lay in the sharp intellect behind his handsome face- a fact known only to a select few, including Lim So-bo.

As Lim Ji-mun left the inn, Lee Gwak spoke:

“Don’t mind him. Let’s just drink.”

“Right.”

Oh Jung-gyeong nodded.

Lee Gwak left him and headed to his room. Inside was a large wooden tub filled with cold water for a quick bath.

A normal person would not dare to enter the cold water, but for a master like Lee Gwak, the chill was not a problem.

He stripped off his clothes and stepped into the barrel.

Though he felt a hint of cold, it didn’t bother him.

With his eyes closed, Lee Gwak enjoyed the bath.

After the long journey, immersing himself in clean water refreshed his mind.

About half an hour later, Lee Gwak got out of the tub.

A light circulation of internal energy dried him instantly.

As he went to put on his clothes, a smile touched his lips.

A bath after such a long journey always made him feel good.

But as he reached for his clothes, Lee Gwak frowned slightly.

After traveling so far, his clothes were covered in dust. Wearing them now would ruin the effect of the bath.

He channeled his internal energy into the clothes.

Pah!

The fabric shook out, releasing all the hidden dust.

Lee Gwak waved his hand gently, gathering the dust and directing it out the window.

Though not as clean as if washed, the clothes were now presentable.

Satisfied, Lee Gwak dressed.

The fresh clothes improved his mood, and a smile naturally formed on his face.

He picked up his blade, Star Soul, and headed downstairs.

“Over here!”

Oh Jung-gyeong was already waiting at a table on the first floor.

A bottle of liquor and a plate of water fish were set out.

The bottle was open—he’d already had a drink.

Lee Gwak sat across from him.

“Already started?”

“You were late. What were you doing, bathing like a woman?”

“I just felt like taking my time today.”

“Didn’t expect you to be sentimental. I wonder if the world knows the great Sura Blade has a soft side.”

“Let them know or not—it doesn’t matter. Just pour the drink.”

“Heh.”

Just as Oh Jung-gyeong laughed and reached for the bottle—

“What the hell? It’s ridiculously crowded here too.”

A booming voice echoed from the entrance of the inn.

Lee Gwak turned his head to look and saw a giant man, seemingly in his early twenties, stepping inside. A massive horse-slaying blade, nearly as tall as he was, hung across his back, making him resemble a seasoned hunter.

Beside him was a beautiful young woman of a similar age.

As she looked around the room, she spoke to the giant man.

“Everywhere’s going to be like this. It’s not just any event—it’s the Wudang Sect’s grand reopening. Of course, people are swarming in.”

“Damn it! Are we gonna end up sleeping on the street at this rate?”

The giant wore an expression of deep frustration.

He and the woman had already checked several inns, but none had any rooms left.

Because of this, the giant man’s nerves were on edge.

If they couldn’t find a room here, they’d have no choice but to sleep outside. He wouldn’t mind roughing it himself, but he couldn’t let the woman sleep on the streets.

Thud! Thud!

The giant man stomped heavily toward the innkeeper.

The innkeeper flinched at his fierce demeanor.

“Hey! Got any rooms left?”

“W-well… they’re all taken…”

“All taken?”

“Y-yes! An escort agency just rented out the last ones.”

“An escort agency, huh?”

The giant man’s eyes gleamed like a beast’s.

The innkeeper swallowed hard, instinctively sensing danger.

The giant man asked,

“Where’s the person in charge of that escort agency?”

“Over there…”

The innkeeper’s finger pointed straight ahead—right at Oh Jung-gyeong.
