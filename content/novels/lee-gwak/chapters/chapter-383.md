Po Cheon-wol was deeply immersed in his cultivation, his eyes closed.

A white mist emanated from his entire body, a phenomenon that occurred when his cultivation reached its peak. His toned body, which belied his age, was drenched in sweat as if caught in a downpour.

The sweat dripping from him had a murky brown tint—proof that the impurities within his body were being expelled.

As his cultivation reached its peak, Po Cheon-wol bit his lip. The pain within him had intensified to an unbearable degree.

He was not cultivating to enhance his internal energy.

It was purely for recovery—to heal his wounds.

His Eight Meridians were in ruins, and his Heart Meridian had suffered severe damage. If not for Po Cheon-wol’s profound internal energy, which far surpassed human limits, he would no longer be among the living.

The intense heat radiating from his body gradually subsided, and his expression relaxed slightly.

While his internal injuries were not completely healed, he had at least overcome the immediate crisis.

“Huu!”

Po Cheon-wol exhaled sharply as he opened his eyes, concluding his cultivation.

For a brief moment, a fierce light flashed in his gaze. But he quickly controlled his gaze and checked the state of his body.

“Damn it!”

As expected, it wasn’t perfect.

The internal injuries were too severe for a single round of energy circulation to completely heal them.

“Wudang Sect!”

Po Cheon-wol gritted his teeth so hard they might have shattered.

He had received these wounds after underestimating Wudang’s First Sword and foolishly challenging him.

“The Unity of Sword and Self…”

The Unity of Sword and Self was regarded as one of the pinnacles of swordsmanship, alongside Sword Aura and Sword Illusion.

He never expected that a martial artist who looked barely thirty would have reached such an unfathomable realm.

Because of his carelessness, he had not only suffered humiliation but also sustained severe internal injuries.

It would have been one thing if no one had been there, but thousands of spectators, including Namgung Jin-geom of the Namgung Family, Eun Won-ho of the Myriad Merchant Troupe, and Bang Ju-gwang of the Bang Clan’s Inn, had witnessed his disgrace.

In front of them, he had been utterly disgraced.

An unforgivable shame.

Just imagining Namgung Jingeom and Eun Won-ho mocking him made his vision darken with anger.

Even his defeat at the hands of Ja Hong-cheon of the Jade Heaven Alliance hadn’t been this humiliating.

After all, Ja Hong-cheon was one of the strongest martial artists standing at the very peak of the Jianghu. But Jinghae was different.

No matter how much he relied on the Wudang Sect’s prestige, Jinghae was barely thirty.

If word spread that he had lost to such a young martial artist, Po Cheon-wol wouldn’t be able to show his face in the Jianghu again.

“I will have my revenge Jinghae!”

Po Cheon-wol rose from his seat.

He had to recover before he could take revenge.

Fortunately, his injuries had mostly healed, but his physical wounds remained. Until they were completely healed, he had to restrain himself from any intense movements.

“Hah!”

Just as Po Cheon-wol gulped down water from the table—

“Lord Po!”

A voice called from outside.

“What is it? I gave orders not to disturb me during my healing!”

“My apologies, but the matter is urgent…”

Po Cheon-wol frowned.

His most trusted subordinate wouldn’t have come if it wasn’t really important.

“What is it?”

“The Little Strategist requests an audience with you.”

“The Little Strategist?”

The “Little Strategist” referred to Lim So-bo.

Normally, she would be addressed as “Strategist” or with a title indicating her position, but due to her young age, the Sky High Castle referred to her with the prefix “Little”.

Po Cheon-wol answered irritably,

“Unless it’s urgent, tell her to come another time.”

“I did, but she insisted…”

“She’s being stubborn?”

“She said if you refuse her request, she will leave Sky High Castle.”

“What?!”

Po Cheon-wol’s eyebrows shot up in disbelief.

From his perspective, Lim So-bo was a valuable asset.

Since her arrival, the Sky High Castle had been reorganized more efficiently, and its financial situation had improved.

Though he hesitated to test her military capabilities due to her age, her administrative skills were undeniable.

For Po Cheon-wol, she was a talent he couldn’t afford to lose.

There was still so much he could gain from her—he couldn’t let her leave like this.

“Bring her to the main hall.”

“Yes!”

After issuing the command, Po Cheon-wol changed his clothes.

His previous robes were soaked with expelled impurities and stank unbearably.

Once dressed, he stepped into the main hall, where Lim So-bo was already waiting.

“Greetings, Master Po.”

“What brings you here at this hour?”

“I have something to discuss.”

Lim So-bo’s eyes were bloodshot as she looked at him.

“Did something happen?”

“My master… has passed away.”

“Your master? You mean Yeo Jung-wol?”

“Yes.”

“Hmm…”

Po Cheon-wol let out a low hum.

One of the reasons he had accepted Lim So-bo as his strategist was precisely because of Yeo Jung-wol’s influence.

Yeo Jung-wol was widely recognized as the greatest strategist in the Jianghu. It was because of him that the Jade Heaven Alliance’s military strength remained stable.

Some even said that if he had taken the forefront in the war against the Seven Sects, the conflict would have already ended—with the Jade Heaven Alliance’s victory.

Such was Yeo Jung-wol’s worth.

Po Cheon-wol had coveted him for years, attempting multiple times to recruit him into the Sky High Castle. But each time, Yeo Jung-wol politely declined, stating he could not leave the Jade Heaven Alliance.

The one he had recommended in his stead was Lim So-bo.

Po Cheon-wol had accepted her as a substitute of Yeo Jung-wol.

“A pity. Had he joined us, Sky High Castle would have flourished even more. So, is that why you’ve come?”

“I want revenge for my master.”

“Revenge? Against the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

“Yes!”

Lim So-bo answered without hesitation.

Po Cheon-wol frowned as he looked at her.

“I understand how you feel. I’m no different—I despise Ja Hong-cheon enough to grind his bones to dust. But we must separate ideals from reality. The Sky High Castle’s current strength is no match for the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“We have an alliance with the Thousand Kingdom School. As you know, I can mobilize their forces. With them, we can deal a fatal blow to the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“I cannot allow that.”

“Master Poi”

“I understand your feelings, but as the lord of Sky High Castle, I cannot permit personal grudges to drain Sky High Castle’s strength.”

Po Cheon-wol’s tone was final.

His resolute gaze left no room for negotiation.

Lim So-bo bit her lip.

“Then when will we fight the Changcheon Alliance?”

“Once Sky High Castle’s strength has at least doubled…”

“……”

“By then, even if you try to stop me, I will be the first to lead the charge against them. So let us endure a little longer and grow stronger. A nobleman’s revenge is never too late, even if it takes ten years. Time is on our side.”

“I… understand. Your will is absolute, Master Po.”

“You’ll abide by my decision?”

“Yes!”

Lim So-bo’s eyelids trembled faintly. But since her head was bowed, Po Cheon-wol couldn’t see her expression.

“I shall take my leave now.”

“Very well. Rest and clear your mind.”

“Yes.”

Lim So-bo rose from her seat.

Po Cheon-wol silently watched her retreating figure, his teeth clenched.

Thud!

Once the door closed behind her, Po Cheon-wol called out to someone.

“Cheol Ryeong!”

“Yes, Master Po!”

A shadowy figure appeared in front of him without a sound and knelt down.

“Keep a close eye on So-bo.”

“Understood.”

“If she shows any signs of betrayal, report to me immediately.”

“By your command!”

Cheol Ryeong vanished as swiftly as he had appeared.

Alone again, Po Cheon-wol muttered to himself,

“You still have much to do for me.”

Bang!

Lim So-bo slammed her door shut.

Cheon Wol, who had been waiting inside, approached her.

“So-bo!”

“He refused.”

So-bo pressed her forehead against Cheon Wol’s chest and began pounding it lightly.

Cheon Wol silently accepted her actions.

Ever since Cheon Wol had become her shadow, this was how So-bo vented her frustrations.

The longer her turmoil lasted, the more she would thump her forehead against Cheon Wol’s chest.

Thud! Thud!

Then, at some point, Lim So-bo stopped.

It was a sign that her internal conflict had reached its conclusion.

“I need to leave Sky High Castle.”

“Will the Castle Master let you go so easily?”

“That’s why we’ll slip away quietly.”

“And after that?”

“I’ll meet Brother Gwak.”

A strange light flickered in Cheon Wol’s eyes.

Lim So-bo pulled away from Cheon Wol and sat down in a chair, speaking quietly.

“I’ve been thinking a lot. Is Po Cheon-wol truly a leader worth serving? Is he someone I can trust and follow for the rest of my life?”

She had never officially joined the Sky High Castle.

She had never sworn loyalty to Po Cheon-wol.

She had only settled in Sky High Castle out of mutual necessity, working tirelessly day and night to defeat their common enemy—the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Even when she was rejected for being too young or mocked for being a woman, she endured. She had believed that one day, when she brought her master, Yeo Jung-wol, everything would be resolved.

But Yeo Jung-wol had lost his life, and Po Cheon-wol’s spirit seemed broken.

There was no longer any reason for her to stay in the Sky High Castle.

After hearing the tragic news, something inside her that she had been suppressing for so long finally burst forth. A change had taken place within her.

That change was visible in her eyes.

A coldness that had never been there before now lingered in Lim So-bo’s gaze.

The same was true for Cheon Wol.

In the past, he might have persuaded her to reconsider. But Cheon Wol had changed just like So-bo.

Swish!

At that moment—

A faint presence brushed against Cheon Wol’s senses.

In an instant, he shot upward toward the ceiling.

Thud!

A hole burst open in the ceiling, and Cheon Wol vanished in the blink of an eye.

Lim So-bo frowned as she looked up.

Swiish! Swish!

A sharp cracking sound echoed from the ceiling.

A short while later Cheon Wol dropped back down through the hole, gripping someone by the nape of their neck.

Thump!

When Cheon Wol released his grip, a black-clad martial artist collapsed limply to the floor.

The man, unconscious with a severe wound in his abdomen, was none other than Cheol ryeong, the spy PoCheon Wol had sent to monitor Lim Sobo.

Lim Sobo didn’t know Cheol ryeong’s true identity, but it wasn’t hard to guess that he was someone Po Cheon Wol had assigned to watch her.

“So the Castle Master doubts me.”

“Now that we’ve killed his spy, he won’t stay silent.”

“Hah! So he’s cut the last faint tie himself.”

Lim Sobo shook her head.

With this, any lingering affection she had for the Sky High Castle was completely gone.

“Just a moment…”

She stepped behind an ornate folding screen.

Rustle.

Cheon Wol could hear Lim So-bo taking off her clothes.

With his eyes closed, Cheon Wol patiently waited.

Moments later, Lim Sobo reappeared, having changed.

She had shed all the garments and accessories bestowed by the Sky High Castle and returned to the attire she had worn when she first arrived.

By returning everything she had received from the Sky High Castle, Lim Sobo was making a clean break.

No feelings remained in her heart.

Finally, she left a letter on the table stating she was resigning as the castle’s strategist.

It was, in her own way, a show of courtesy.

“Let’s go.”

“Yes, let’s.”

Cheon Wol nodded and followed her out.

Outside, countless martial artists stood guard, but none of them noticed the pair slipping away.

Just like that, they disappeared from the Sky High Castle without a trace.

It was about six hours later that the Sky High Castle realized they were gone.

“Find her at once! Right now!”

Po Cheon Wol’s furious roar echoed through the Sky High Castle, and countless martial artists mobilized to hunt down Lim Sobo.
