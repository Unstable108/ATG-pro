In the Celestial Demon Troupe, there were many large and splendid halls.

Some were so magnificent that they looked like works of art. Among those halls, however, there was one that felt distinctly out of place.

The Demon Palace.

In the past, the Demon Palace had been used as a conference room for the leadership of the Celestial Demon Troupe, but now it served as the residence of Go Geom-wol.

In the center of Gunma Hall stood a large throne known as the Heavenly Throne—the seat upon which only the lord of the Celestial Demon Troupe could sit.

Now that the Heavenly Throne was his, Go Geom-wol occupied it and gazed straight ahead.

Standing in front of him were two young boys.

Both boys were extremely thin and ragged. Even after being brought here and fed well, this was all they had managed to regain. When they had first arrived, they were barely alive. It was almost a miracle that they were still breathing. Their bodies were so ruined that they had lost all muscle, and they were suffering from severe malnutrition, even to the point of organ failure.

Go Geom-wol had thought it likely that one of them—or perhaps both—might not survive. But to his surprise, both boys managed to pull through.

With a calm but heavy gaze, Go Geom-wol looked at the boys. At that, one of them subtly positioned himself in front of the other, shielding him.

His eyes were full of wariness.

Go Geom-wol finally spoke.

“Someone told me you two are brothers?”

“Yes, sir… I am the older brother.”

“Your names?”

“My name is Jang Cheon-hwa, and my younger brother is Jang Cheon-sa.”

“Cheon-hwa and Cheon-sa…”

Jang Cheon-hwa and Jang Cheon-sa were the boys Go Geom-wol had rescued when he had cleared out the slums.

They were in a miserable situation because they had been sold to the slum’s fighting ring.

Because they were still so young, they had not yet been forced into actual matches—but they had been used for sideshow events to entertain the crowd.

They had fought wild dogs or been forced to fight other small children and suffered constant abuse.

The age difference between Jang Cheon-hwa and Jang Cheon-sa was a mere two years.

Cheon-hwa was ten and Cheon-sa was eight.

They were both at an age where they needed their parents’ care, but they had been suddenly cast into the harshest environment imaginable.

In a world where they had nothing to rely on or believe in, Jang Cheon-hwa fought for his younger brother’s survival. He fought wolves in the pit and even had to kill other orphans there.

Time and time again, he fought on, driven by a single-minded determination to protect his younger brother.

No matter how cruel the trials, he never backed down.

To Wang Cheol, the Iron-Blooded Demon who ruled the slums, Jang Cheon-hwa had been a useful tool.

But one day, when Jang Cheon-hwa refused an order, Wang Cheol locked the brothers up and starved them.

Wanting to break their spirit, he denied them even water for almost ten days.

On the verge of death, the two brothers were rescued by Go Geom-wol.

Yet, even now, their eyes were filled with wariness as they looked at him.

They trusted no one.

Not even Go Geom-wol, the supreme leader of the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Go Geom-wol felt a shiver run through him as he watched Jang Cheon-hwa’s fierce, unyielding gaze.

It was as if lightning had struck him—his entire body tingled.

The last time he had felt this way was over a decade ago, when he first met Lee Gwak.

And now, for the first time in ten years, he felt that same sensation.

‘Is this fate?’

Just as his master, Jin Gwang-hon, had recognized him at a glance, Go Geom-wol immediately saw Jang Cheon-hwa’s potential.

Heavenly Talent.

A vessel blessed by the heavens.

Though his body was thin and unimpressive, his bone structure was perfect for martial arts.

But what truly pleased Go Geom-wol was Jang Cheon-hwa’s eyes.

The unyielding will burning in them—like a tiger’s.

A heart that refused to break, no matter the hardship.

And the unwavering resolve to protect what was precious to him.

Jang Cheon-hwa possessed everything a true martial artist needed.

Above all, what Go Geom-wol admired most was his fearless defiance—even in the presence of someone like him.

Jang Cheon-hwa knew Go Geom-wol was the supreme leader of the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Yet, he still stepped forward to shield his brother.

Even the Celestial Demon Troupe’s elite warriors wouldn’t dare do such a thing.

But this mere ten-year-old child did.

A faint smile touched Go Geom-wol’s lips.

A talent that appeared only once in a generation stood before him.

‘This is destiny.’

For such a prodigy to appear at this time was no coincidence.

Go Geom-wol rose from his seat.

Immediately, Jang Cheon-hwa shielded his brother with his entire body and spoke.

“I’ll do anything—just spare my brother.”

“Anything?”

“Yes!”

“Even if it means giving up your life?”

“I’ll give it.”

Jang Cheon-hwa answered without hesitation.

His demeanor was far beyond that of a normal child.

Go Geom-wol stepped closer and said,

“Then prove your worth.”

“My worth?”

“If you want to protect your brother, prove your value.”

“What must I do?”

“Follow that man. He will take you where you must prove yourself.”

Go Geom-wol gestured to a martial artist standing at the entrance.

Jang Cheon-hwa bit his lip hard. But then, he strode forward resolutely.

“Hyung!”

Behind him, Jang Cheon-sa called out.

Without looking back, Jang Cheon-hwa replied,

“I’ll be back soon. Just wait here, okay?”

“But…”

“Someone as great as the leader of the Celestial Demon Troupe wouldn’t lie. Just wait a little. Trust me, alright?”

“I trust you!”

Jang Cheon-sa nodded.

Jang Cheon-hwa turned to the martial artist.

“Let’s go!”

The martial artist glanced at Go Geom-wol.

At that moment, a soundless voice Transmission—reached his ears.

—Take that child to Yang No-sa of the True Demon Palace.

Yang No-sa referred to Yang Guang-baek, the lord of the True Demon Palace.

As the leader of the Ten Blood Demons, Yang Guang-baek was the strongest martial artist in the Celestial Demon Troupe after Go Geom-wol.

Not only was his martial prowess unmatched, but he was also unparalleled in laying the foundation for martial artists. Go Geom-wol himself had trained under Yang Gwang-baek as a child.

The problem?

Yang Guang-baek pushed his disciples to the brink of death.

He believed true talent only bloomed in the face of death.

If Jang Cheon-hwa survived—if he passed Yang Gwang-baek’s trials—he would earn the right to become Go Geom-wol’s disciple.

‘Until then, I’ll watch.’

Just as solidifying the Celestial Demon Troupe’s foundation was crucial, so was raising a worthy successor.

Though Go Geom-wol himself had forcibly overthrown his master to claim leadership, he had no aversion to nurturing a successor.

If his successor surpassed him, he wouldn’t mind following in his master’s footsteps. After all, a stronger warrior would undoubtedly lead the Celestial Demon Troupe to greater heights.

Jang Cheon-hwa disappeared beyond the hall, following the martial artist.

Then, Jang Cheon-sa cautiously spoke.

“Should… should I just wait here for my brother?”

“Hm?”

Only then did Go Geom-wol’s gaze shift to Jang Cheon-sa.

The presence of Jang Cheon-hwa had been so overwhelming that he had momentarily forgotten about the younger brother.

Jang Cheon-sa’s talent wasn’t ordinary either. But compared to his brother, he fell short. Thus, he failed to capture Go Geom-wol’s interest.

Go Geom-wol briefly pondered what to do with him.

If he intended to take Jang Cheon-hwa as a disciple later, he couldn’t treat Jang Cheon-sa poorly.

He summoned a subordinate and issued an order.

“Take this child to the master of the Ten Thousand Scriptures Pavilion.

“By your command!”

The Ten Thousand Scriptures Pavilion was where the Celestial Demon Troupe stored its vast collection of texts.

From martial arts manuals to miscellaneous books, the shelves were packed. Among them were some exceptional martial treatises, but most were ordinary or even trivial works.

Although the world of martial arts was changing rapidly, many still believed that martial arts should be passed down orally by a good master to a good disciple.

The Celestial Demon Troupe had established the Ten Thousand Scriptures Pavilion to systematically record and manage martial arts, but not many martial artists followed this policy.

They were reluctant to let their personal secrets be leaked to the outside. However, there were still those who willingly entrusted their secrets to the Ten Thousand Scriptures Pavilion, though they were few.

Go Geom Wol said to Jang Cheon-sa,

“Your brother is meant for great things.”

“Great things?”

“Yes! If your brother truly becomes my disciple, he will bear a great destiny that will revitalize the Celestial Demon Troupe. When that happens, many will seek to exploit him, pouncing on even the smallest flaw like wolves.”

“So… I’m his flaw?”

“……”

“If I stay in the Ten Thousand Scriptures Pavilion, I won’t be a burden to him?”

“That’s right.”

“Then I’ll never leave.”

Jang Cheon-sa answered with an unexpectedly mature expression.

“Do you resent me for this?”

“This is for my brother’s sake. He’s always taken on every tough, dangerous, and unpleasant task to protect me. Without me, he would already be a far more impressive person. If he hadn’t been burdened by someone like me, he would have excelled anywhere.”

“ … ”

“So now it’s my turn to do something for him. I’m glad there’s at least this way for me to help.”

Jang Cheon-sa smiled. But Go Geom-wol could not smile in return.

This child is extraordinary, too.

In truth, Go Geom-wol wanted to accept Jang Cheon-sa as a disciple as well. But he could easily envision what would happen if he did.

The Celestial Demon Troupe could have only one sun.

No matter how close the brothers might be, others would not leave them in peace. They would sow discord between the two and stoke ambitions for power. No matter how resolute the brothers’ hearts, it would be difficult to remain untainted by outside scheming.

It was better for everyone that one of them be “exiled” to a place free of politics or power struggles.

Jang Cheon-sa bowed politely to Go Geom-wol, then left with the waiting martial artist. There was no hatred or resentment in his eyes as he followed that man.

His expression and gaze were more reminiscent of a Taoist recluse than a typical martial artist.

He left the hall. Now alone, Go Geom-wol murmured,

“I’m sorry, child. If you must resent someone, let it be me.”

Cheon-wol moved his limbs back and forth.

His badly damaged body had recovered enough that he could move it as he wished. Considering how close he had been to death, it was nothing short of a miracle.

However, no one else riding the carriage with Cheon-wol thought of it as a miracle, because they had seen the effort he put in during the journey.

His own strenuous efforts, combined with the effects of the Ginseng Doll.

His damaged organs had regained their original function, and the crushed muscles had returned to their normal state.

Cheon-wol performed a body check.

‘My internal energy has increased significantly.’

It had at least doubled compared to before.

Even taking a medicinal herb like Ginseng Doll, fully absorbing its effects was not easy.

It was possible because Lee Gwak had helped him fully absorb the medicinal properties of Ginseng Doll.

Lee Gwak had not only saved Cheon-wol’s life but also greatly helped increase his internal energy.

‘Phew! I owe my brother too much, I don’t know how I can ever repay him.’

Cheon-wol sighed softly.

Just then, the carriage came to a slow stop with a heavy sound.

Cheon-wol opened the door and stepped outside. There he saw Lee Gwak with Oh Jung-gyeong.

Over the days they traveled together, the two had become much closer. It no longer felt strange to describe them as friends.

Oh Jung-gyeong noticed Cheon-wol and spoke to Lee Gwak,

“Your brother is here. We’ll talk again later.”

“Sure!”

Lee Gwak nodded, and Oh Jung-gyeong left with a smile, which Cheon-wol took his place.

“Brother!”

“How are you feeling?”

“I can move now.”

“That’s good.”

“Looks like we’ll be sleeping out here tonight?”

“That’s right.”

“That’s good.”

Cheon-wol’s unexpected words made Lee Gwak frown slightly.

“You want something?”

“Yes!”

“What is it?”

“Please fight with me.”

“Are you talking about a sparring match?”

“Yes! I know our journey has been much delayed because of me. But I cannot return in such a powerless state. Please help me.”

Lee Gwak stared at Cheon-wol.

Anger filled Cheon-wol’s eyes.

His wounds had somewhat healed, but the darkness that overshadowed his heart remained.

Lee Gwak wondered whether it was really right to engage in a sparring match with Cheon-wol. He was concerned that he might be nurturing a killer instinct with his own hands.

However, his concerns did not last long.

He didn’t think Cheon-wol would be so lacking in discernment.

Lee Gwak grabbed his weapon and walked out of the camping area, and Cheon-wol followed him.

They stood facing each other, maintaining a distance of three stances.

The first to speak was Lee Gwak.

“Come at me!”

“Please give it your all. Even if I die…”

“If that’s what you want…”

“I want it.”

Pop!

At that moment, Cheon-wol kicked off the ground and charged at Lee Gwak.

“Huh!”

Watching Cheon-wol charge at him like a beast, Lee Gwak let out a soft sigh. Yet, his gaze was as cold and sharp as Cheon-wol’s.
