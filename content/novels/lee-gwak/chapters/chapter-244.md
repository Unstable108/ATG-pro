Han So Cheon sat on a large rock and gazed absentmindedly at the river flowing by. Dressed as a peasant, it seemed impossible to discern her true identity as an assassin.

Since leaving the Black Merchant branch, Han So Cheon hadn’t rested for even a day. Despite changing routes multiple times and altering her appearance, she couldn’t let her guard down.

“The White Light Sect might not know, but the Hidden Blood Squad will never give up on pursuing me.”

Once assigned a mission, the Hidden Blood Squad was known to relentlessly pursue their target until death.

Having once been a part of the Hidden Blood Squad, Han So Cheon knew this better than anyone.

At this very moment, the Hidden Blood Squad was likely on her trail. Initially, she was lucky to escape their clutches, but she could not count on her luck a second time.

Just as Han So Cheon let out a sigh, she sensed a rustling in the reeds along the riverbank.

Quickly grasping her sword, she adopted a defensive stance. Her eyes sparkled with a subtle lethal intent.

Then, a familiar voice came from the reeds.

Only then did Han So Cheon withdraw her killing intent.

Soon after, Ki Jin-hwi emerged from the reeds, carrying groceries he had acquired from a nearby market.

Handing over the groceries to Han So Cheon, Ki Jin-hwi spoke.

“For the time being, we might not need to worry about the White Light Sect and the Black Merchants.”

“The Jade Heaven Alliance has declared war on the Nine Sects. The whole world is in turmoil because of it.”

Ki Jin-hwi relayed the news he had heard at the local market to Han So Cheon. Throughout the story, Han So Cheon’s expression remained grim.

“The Jade Heaven Alliance declared war?”

“Ja Hong-cheon’s confidence is extraordinary. No one expected him to declare war against all Nine Sects.”

“What is he thinking? The Nine Sects are not to be underestimated.”

“Would he really turn all Nine Sects into enemies? Perhaps he intends to make an example of a few sects first. The rest will probably fall in line after that.”

“Anyway, this is good news for us. Even the White Light Sect’s attention is slightly diverted.”

“The White Light Sect might, but the Hidden Blood Squad will never stop their pursuit. They will not stop or give up until they confirm my death.”

“It’s indeed ruthless of the assassins. Oh, my apologies… I didn’t mean to speak of you when I said that.”

“By the way, I’ve also heard news about the leader.”

Han So Cheon brightened up at the news.

Since escaping from the branch of the Black Merchants, she and Ki Jin-hwi had moved to remote locations, leaving them cut off from outside news.

“I can’t confirm his exact whereabouts, but it seems he broke through Heaven and Earth Net and headed north.”

Lee Gwak was now a well-known figure in the Jianghu.

Unless he deliberately kept his movements secret, his whereabouts were bound to be exposed. Especially since he had been moving hastily due to Lee Cheong’s condition, many people had seen him.

“Have you heard anything about the children?”

“I’m sorry, no one seems to know about that. But don’t worry too much. The Leader I know would never abandon them, no matter the circumstances.”

“Then trust in the leader. If you find him, you will surely meet the children as well.”

Han So Cheon nodded at Ki Jin-hwi’s words.

Her face was filled with longing.

She wanted to see Lee Gwak as soon as possible and also meet the children. If she could see them all together, she would have no regrets, even if it meant losing her life.

‘Just wait a little longer. I’ll be there soon.’

Han So Cheon’s gaze turned northward.

Lee Gwak suddenly looked back. He could see the face of Lee Cheong, who was asleep on his back. Lee Cheong had buried his face against Lee Gwak’s back, sleeping.

Now, Lee Cheong spent much more time asleep than awake. He was only alert when taking the Life Saving Pills; the rest of his time was mostly spent in sleep.

Even in his sleep, the pain seemed relentless, as his furrowed brow never eased.

Lee Gwak bit his lip slightly.

Just seeing Lee Cheong in pain was heart-wrenching.

‘Just hold on a little longer. I will definitely find the divine physician to cure your illness.’

Lee Gwak moved carefully, ensuring that Lee Cheong wouldn’t be disturbed by any shocks.

They were now not far from Yeosan.

Finding the divine physician in Yeosan was another challenge, but reaching Yeosan was an achievement in itself.

One problem was that there was no branch of the Hao Clan in Yeosan. From now on, they would have to search for a healer without their assistance.

It was a daunting task, yet Lee Gwak never despaired.

Despair comes only when one gives up.

Throughout his life, Lee Gwak had faced numerous hardships but never let go of hope. Even when everyone else saw a situation as hopeless, he always managed to find a way through.

Such experiences had fortified Lee Gwak’s resolve.

For Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah, he had to become even stronger.

With that thought, Lee Gwak continued on his way.

They arrived at Yeosan in the evening.

Yeosan, located between Xi’an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, and Huayin County, was predominantly covered with cypress trees. Hidden throughout the mountains were various Taoist temples, the most famous of which was the Nomo Palace.

Because of this, people flocked to Yeosan year-round, seeking its temples and hot springs, making it a bustling place.

After securing a suitable inn, Lee Gwak spoke to Cheol Gwang Woo.

“I will go out to look for the divine physician. Stay here and take care of the children.”

“How do you plan to find the divine physician in such a vast area?”

“I’ve already thought of a way. Just take care of the children.”

“Understood. Don’t worry. I will protect the children with my life if necessary.”

Lee Gwak then turned his gaze to Lee Soo-ah.

“Can you take care of Cheong-ah while I’m away?”

“Don’t worry about Cheong-ah. I’ll take good care of him.”

Lee Soo-ah smiled at Lee Gwak.

Just seeing her smile made all the fatigue that had accumulated in Lee Gwak feel as though it had dissipated.

After patting Lee Soo-ah’s head, Lee Gwak left the inn.

His first task upon leaving the inn was to find a restaurant known for its taste in the area.

“If you’re in Yeosan, you must visit the Five Great Inns. There’s no match for its flavor.”

“Five Great Inns is indeed the best in the world.”

People unanimously praised the cuisine of Five Great Inns as the best in the world. According to them, there were five famous inns, both large and small, around Yeosan, known for their cuisine, each unparalleled and incomparable.

Lee Gwak’s first stop was the Seowol Inn, one of the Five Great Inns. It seemed the recommendations were not exaggerated, as the inn was packed with people, not a single table left empty.

“What should we do? We’re fully booked and can’t accommodate more guests.”

The innkeeper looked apologetic.

“I’m not here to eat. Has a girl named Bang Ye-in ever visited here?”

“She might seem ordinary, but she has a very expressive face and a deep knowledge of food. If she’s been here, she would have ordered everything on the menu. She might have even asked the chef for their secret recipes.”

The innkeeper looked perplexed, and Lee Gwak did not miss his reaction.

Bang Ye-in would naturally have visited all the Five Great Inns.

The fastest way Lee Gwak thought to find the divine physician was to trace Bang Ye-in’s steps.

Since Bang Ye-in was also searching for the divine physician, finding her would naturally lead him to the physician’s whereabouts.

Lee Gwak tossed a silver coin to the hesitant innkeeper, who then spilled everything he knew.

“Actually, a girl like that visited not long ago. She was so knowledgeable about food and even bothered our chef, so I still remember her.”

“Did she mention where she was going?”

“Think carefully. Any small detail she mentioned could be helpful.”

The innkeeper ultimately couldn’t recall anything specific.

Lee Gwak left the Seowol Guesthouse.

Fortunately, the other innkeepers also remembered Bang Ye-in. Finally, at the last inn, he found a clue about her whereabouts.

“Our chef doesn’t usually lend the kitchen to anyone, but for some reason, he did for that girl. She made a lunchbox in the kitchen and said she was going to Hua Qing Chi when I asked her where she was headed.”

“It’s a famous hot spring located at the base of Yeosan. It has been renowned for its efficacy since ancient times, even the emperors used it.”

“When did she say she was going to Hua Qing Chi?”

“It’s been a while. Probably about ten days ago.”

If ten days had passed, Bang Ye-in might have already left. Knowing her wanderlust, it was possible. But Lee Gwak couldn’t give up.

Finding Bang Ye-in was the only way to locate the physician now.

Despite the late hour, Lee Gwak did not return to the inn where Lee Cheong and the others were staying but headed straight to Hua Qing Chi.

Lee Cheong’s condition was worsening by the day. Lee Gwak had to find Bang Ye-in and the healer as soon as possible.

Utilizing his qigong, Lee Gwak made his way to Hua Qing Chi.

In his urgency, he moved as fast as the wind and soon arrived at Hua Qing Chi.

Fitting for a place used by emperors, Hua Qing Chi was adorned with splendid pavilions.

Lee Gwak knocked on the door of Hua Qing Chi. After a moment, the door opened, and a worker peeked out.

“We’re closed for the day. Please come back tomorrow.”

As the worker tried to close the door, Lee Gwak wedged his hand in the door gap. The worker was startled.

The door wouldn’t close, and the worker realized Lee Gwak was a martial artist.

“It’s urgent. I’m looking for a girl named Bang Ye-in who came here about ten days ago.”

Lee Gwak described Bang Ye-in’s appearance to the worker, who then became wary.

“Why are you looking for her?”

“She’s my sister. She said she was traveling here, but something happened, and I haven’t heard from her, so I came looking.”

Lee Gwak resorted to a lie in his urgency. The worker believed his story and opened the door wide.

“Ah, your sister. Yes, she did stay here, but she left a few days ago after a big fight with someone.”

“It was a guest staying here. A girl around your sister’s age who for some reason picked a quarrel with her.”

“Oh, don’t even ask! The fight was so fierce that furniture was broken, and a pavilion nearly collapsed. If your sister hadn’t managed to subdue that girl, Hua Qing Chi would have been ruined. After subduing her, your sister paid for the damages and left.”

“I’m not sure… Ah, she mentioned Immortal Cloud Valley. Maybe she went there.”

“It’s a valley to the north of Yeosan. It’s quite rugged, with many wild animals and hardly any people.”

The worker detailed how to find the Immortal Cloud Valley, and Lee Gwak absorbed every word.

“Thank you. This has been very helpful.”

Lee Gwak handed him a silver piece before leaving. However, the worker’s next words caught Lee Gwak’s attention.

“Actually, her master also inquired about your sister’s whereabouts.”

“Yes! A frightful old hag. Her gaze was so menacing that just looking at her made my legs weak and scared me to death.”

“Could you describe the old hag?”

“She was exactly as horrific as one could imagine. And she carried a bizarre staff.”

“Yes! The staff had a dragon motif on the handle. That’s why I still remember it vividly.”

“So, did you tell her where my sister went?”

“I had to… I thought she would kill me if I didn’t…”

Lee Gwak’s intuition told him there was only one old hag with such a staff.

If his guess was correct, then the girl Bang Ye-in fought must be Spirit Granny’s disciple, Yeom So-so.

Both of them were known for their narrow-mindedness and persistence, they never forgot even the smallest grudge. Once they harbored a vendetta, they would pursue it to the ends of the earth to exact revenge.

‘If it’s really Spirit Granny and her disciple, Yein is in danger.’

Lee Gwak hurriedly left Hua Qing Chi and returned to the inn where the children were staying.

Lee Gwak spoke as he picked up Lee Cheong.

Cheol Gwang Woo looked puzzled.

“Now? In the middle of the night?”

“I’ll explain on the way. Quickly, carry Soo-ah.”

Cheol Gwang Woo quickly woke Soo-ah, picked her up, and followed Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak clenched his teeth, filled with determination.
