The middle-aged man blinked.

At first, he thought it was a mistake. The face before him belonged to a man who had died six years ago.

After rubbing his eyes, the middle-aged man looked at Lee Gwak again.

Although he had matured in appearance, his face was identical to the man in the middle-aged man’s memory.

“Is that you… master Lee?”

“Cha Moo-gyeong, it’s been a long time.”

Lee Gwak responded with a faint smile, showing no sign of surprise.

Just as the middle-aged man recognized Lee Gwak, Lee Gwak immediately recognized him as well.

Cha Moo-gyeong, the Bloodhound Leopard.

A prominent vagrant who used to operate in the vagrant market of Siege Fortress.

He had accompanied Lee Gwak and Yong Cheon Myeong on their mission to the Celestial Demon Troupe. When all other vagrants shunned Lee Gwak, he was the only one who showed kindness to him.

Upon confirming it was Lee Gwak, Cha Moo-gyeong let out a soft sigh.

Seok Mo-sam instinctively realized something had gone wrong the moment he heard the sigh.

He slowly started to back away.

“Seok Mo-sam!”

In that instant, Cha Moo-gyeong glared at Seok Mo-sam, raising his voice.

“Why, why do you say that? Boss.”

“Who said I’m your boss, Seok Mo-sam?”

“What do you mean?”

“Say it again. What happened? You were ambushed cowardly, and that’s how you were beaten? Is that true?”

“That, that’s…”

Overwhelmed by Cha Moo-gyeong’s presence, Seok Mo-sam was rendered speechless. His normally quick wit failed him.

Cha Moo-gyeong stepped towards Seok Mo-sam.

“The man I know, although smart, is not one to concoct schemes. Even less so, he is not someone who would cowardly ambush and overpower someone. He ambushed you for no reason? Do you really think that makes sense?”

“Yikes! I’m dead!”

Unable to think of any excuse and seeing no way to escape, Seok Mo-sam opted for a surprise attack.

His sword was drawn with terrifying speed. However, Cha Moo-gyeong’s reaction was faster.

Suddenly, a fountain of blood erupted from Seok Mo-sam’s forehead.

The hole in his forehead was as large as a coin. Cha Moo-gyeong’s sword had pierced through Seok Mo-sam’s forehead, creating the hole.

It was a fearsome display of swift swordsmanship.

Among those present in the inn, only Lee Gwak and Seop Yu-saeng had seen Cha Moo-gyeong draw his sword, pierce Seok Mo-sam’s forehead, and then retract it.

Even Cheol Gwang Woo was blinking in confusion, not to mention the other vagrants.

Seok Mo-sam collapsed without even a chance to scream.

Cha Moo-gyeong looked coldly at Seok Mo-sam’s body then turned to the other vagrants and said, “Get rid of this trash. And it would be wise for you not to appear before me for a while. I’m in a particularly bad mood right now.”

“Yes? Yes!”

The vagrants hastily wrapped up Seok Mo-sam’s body and scrambled out of the inn.

Watching this, Seop Yu-saeng exclaimed in admiration,

‘Heh, what a fine technique. You’ve really expanded my horizons today.’

“I hope my modest skills have not troubled your eyes, Grandmaster Seop.”

“Do you know me?”

Cha Moo-gyeong smiled at Seop Yu-saeng’s puzzled expression, “In the Jianghu, where martial artists are as numerous as grains of sand on the beach, the only person who has mastered the lute and sword to a mystical level is the esteemed Master Seop Yu-saeng. Am I wrong?”

“No, you are quite remarkable. To deduce my identity with just those two clues. But how unfortunate for me! You know who I am, yet I have no idea about your identity.”

“It would be more surprising if Grandmaster Seop knew of someone as insignificant as me. My name is Cha Moo-gyeong. My comrades call me Bloodhound Leopard.”

“Ah! Bloodhound Leopard Cha, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”

“I’m also pleased to meet Grandmaster Seop. And it’s an honor to see this master Lee again.”

“Ah! So, you two were acquainted before.”

“We traveled together once. I received great help from master Lee at that time.”

He wanted to ask more about the nature of their relationship, but it would be impolite to probe any further.

Intrigued, Seop Yu-saeng looked at Lee Gwak, wanting to know more about their connection, but refraining from prying further as it would be impolite.

Lee Gwak then invited Cha Moo-gyeong to join them,

“If you haven’t had dinner yet, please join us.”

“Ha! I wonder if that’s okay.”

Though he said so, Cha Moo-gyeong naturally joined them.

Once Cha Moo-gyeong sat down, Seop Yu-saeng offered him a drink.

“Please, have a drink.”

“It’s an honor, Grandmaster Seop.”

“Ha! The honor is all mine.”

Seop Yu-saeng laughed and filled Cha Moo-gyeong’s cup to the brim with alcohol.

Cha Moo-gyeong, having been a vagrant for many years, was accustomed to leading the mood at such gatherings.

“Master Cha’s eloquence is extraordinary. Ha ha ha!”

“Grandmaster Seop’s discernment is also remarkable.”

Laughter erupted frequently, and they praised each other. Regardless, Cheol Gwang Woo was too busy devouring the food piled on the table to pay much attention.

Lee Gwak too smiled and drank from his cup.

Cha Moo-gyeong was quick-witted. He skillfully steered the conversation without delving into Lee Gwak’s past, ensuring Seop Yu-saeng learned nothing about it.

Cha Moo-gyeong then addressed Cheol Gwang Woo.

“Don’t worry about a thing. As long as I’m in Leizhou, no other vagrants will dare bother you.”

“Thank you.”

“Thank you for what…”

Cha Moo-gyeong glanced at Lee Gwak, who was silently drinking his liquor.

Lee Gwak’s face, which retained some youthfulness six years ago, now showed no signs of it. Instead, it revealed traces of the passage of time and experience. Yet, it was still hard to gauge his strength just by his appearance.

‘After all, judging that man merely by his appearance would be foolish.’

It was the same six years ago.

Who could have imagined that a mere outer hall squad leader could inflict a wound on the face of Jade Heaven Alliance’s Young Master?

Time had passed since then.

He was strong back then, but how much stronger he might have become now was beyond guess. That’s why Cha Moo-gyeong gave up trying to gauge Lee Gwak’s strength.

The drinking session ended late into the night.

Seop Yu-saeng and Cheol Gwang Woo went up to their rooms, while Lee Gwak and Cha Moo-gyeong stepped outside the inn.

Once they were alone, Lee Gwak suddenly said something.

“I often launch surprise attacks. And I’m good at scheming too.”

“I know, but it’s not something I can admit openly, right?”

Both burst into laughter simultaneously, a reaction they had held back when they were with Seop Yu-saeng and Cheol Gwang Woo.

Suddenly, Cha Moo-gyeong gave a fist-and-palm salute to Lee Gwak, thanking him,

“You saved my life. Thank you, Master Lee.”

“What happened?” Lee Gwak asked, puzzled.

He was unaware of what had happened after parting ways with Yong Cheon Myeong and was curious about the subsequent events.

“After you left, Young Master Yong was distraught for a while. I never imagined that a defeat could shatter the spirit of someone of such high status and martial prowess.”

“The situation was resolved by Grandmaster Seo Jong Myeong of the Diancang Sect.”

While Yong Cheon Myeong was lost in his own world, Seo Jong Myeong showed his true value.

He knew Lee Gwak’s thorough nature well and guessed that Lee Gwak would have prepared an escape route and a safe haven for the weaker 13th squad.

His guess proved correct. He inquired within the 13th squad and fully utilized the escape route Lee Gwak had prepared.

Although there were considerable losses, a significant number of warriors included in the envoy were saved.

“What happened to the 13th squad?”

“They safely returned to Siege Fortress. I don’t know much about what happened after that. I left as soon as we arrived in Siege Fortress.”

“Who knows what Young Master Yong, who was so arrogantly fearless in the world, would do after being wounded by a mere outer hall squad leader?”

“So, you’re saying there was a massacre?”

“Though the warriors formally affiliated with the Jade Heaven Alliance might be silenced by force, how could one silence the mouths of wandering vagrants?”

“The influence Young Master Yong holds within the Jade Heaven Alliance is immense. There’s a clear atmosphere that he’s to be the next sect leader. What would happen if rumors spread that he was wounded not by a martial artist of the Celestial Demon Troupe but by a mere outer hall leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

It wasn’t speculation but certainty.”

Cha Moo-gyeong had left Siege Fortress as soon as he arrived, not looking back, and had since stayed far from the battlefield, settling down here.

“What about the other vagrants?”

“There’s been no news. Though the world of vagrants isn’t vast, and news about well-known figures usually travels fast.”

“So, they were…”

“Likely massacred. Since then, I’ve lived in silence.”

Cha Moo-gyeong offered a bitter smile.

Given Jade Heaven Alliance’s extensive intelligence network, it was unlikely they were unaware of Cha Moo-gyeong’s life as a vagrant here.

“My continued survival is probably because I’ve kept secrets and lived discreetly. The moment I recklessly speak or rumors about Young Master Yong start circulating among others, I’d be as good as dead.”

Lee Gwak murmured thoughtfully, once again realizing the fearsome nature of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

He was also worried about what harm Yong Cheon Myeong might have inflicted on the 13th squad, given his temperament.

Reading the concern on Lee Gwak’s face, Cha Moo-gyeong offered some reassurance, “Don’t worry too much. To Young Master Yong, vagrants like us are as insignificant as flies, but the 13th squad is practically his own people, isn’t it? And since there were others who went together, he wouldn’t have treated them rashly. Instead, they would have been strictly sworn to secrecy.”

“I hope so.”

“And what about you, Master Lee? We hadn’t heard from you in six years, and I thought you were dead.”

“I almost died. It was luck that I survived. I had severe injuries and spent a long time recovering before I could come out.”

“How severe were your injuries?”

“They’re all healed now. You don’t need to worry. But, I have something I’d like to ask.”

“Please, go ahead.”

“Do you know what became of the Hidden Blood Squad?”

“I have no idea.”

Reflecting on it, Lee Gwak’s return, despite the risk of injuring Yong Cheon Myeong, was partly because of the Hidden Blood Squad.

More precisely, it was because of a woman in the Hidden Blood Squad, but that was irrelevant.

A shadow fell over Lee Gwak’s eyes. He had hoped to hear some news of her through Cha Moo-gyeong.

‘It seems I must find out for myself.’

One comforting thought, however, was that while he didn’t know for sure if she was alive, there was no evidence of her death.

Lee Gwak believed that Han So-cheon must be alive somewhere.

Cha Moo-gyeong said,

”In any case, it’s a relief to see you alive and well like this.”

“Thank you.”

“Are you planning to return to the Jade Heaven Alliance now?”

“Yes, that’s the plan.”

Lee Gwak nodded.

“How will you go? I heard that you contributed towards moving Cheol Gwang Woo’s mother and are out of travel funds.”

“Well, something will come up.”

“I can introduce you to a courier service.”

“A courier service?”

“Yes! There happens to be a courier service departing near the Jade Heaven Alliance the day after tomorrow. They’re transporting valuable goods, and the task even came to me.”

“Why not join them directly?”

“I’ve just returned today and would like to rest a bit. I’ve been paid well, and my body has taken quite a beating, so I plan to recuperate and take it easy for a while.”

Lee Gwak understood that Cha Moo-gyeong was considering him, and he appreciated the gesture.

“Thank you. I owe you my life, Master Cha.”

“Compared to the life-saving grace you’ve shown me, Master Lee, this is nothing.”

“Then I’ll gratefully accept your kindness.”

Lee Gwak respectfully gave a fist-and-palm salute to Cha Moo-gyeong.

“I’m sorry this is all I can offer. I hope everything you wish for comes true, Master Lee.”

“Your words are thanks enough.”

“I will pray for fortune in all your future endeavors, Young Master Lee.”

“Well then…”

Lee Gwak turned and headed back to the inn.

As he watched Lee Gwak’s retreating figure, Cha Moo-gyeong muttered to himself, “I wonder what storms you will stir up this time.”

Though Lee Gwak claimed to have spent the last six years merely healing his wounds, Cha Moo-gyeong didn’t believe it.

The Lee Gwak that Cha Moo-gyeong knew was more meticulous and thoughtful than anyone. It was unlikely such a person would reappear in the Jianghu without any preparations.

The storm that began six years ago hadn’t stopped.

Perhaps it had merely quieted down temporarily, gathering strength to blow even harder and more fiercely.
