Manhwa: Chapters 40-41

Episode 5. Dragons and Tigers Gather (1)

The eyes of the sole female member of the Tempest Three Demons trembled.

I didnt see it.

She was a master in her own right.

A martial master who possessed enough power to act as she pleased without fear of repercussions.

Whats more, she was not alone. With her being part of a group of three, she had nothing to fear.

At least, that had been the case until now. Today, she used the excuse of not being able to enter the Jade Heaven Alliance on time as an excuse to take out her frustration on the inn servant. She thought doing so would turn out fine.

Even when the mysterious woman intervened, she initially scoffed. But now, she couldnt.

The earring in her ear was shattered as a warning, but she didnt manage to react in time. Had the other person been truly hostile, she would have been dead.

The beautiful woman in front of her was a master, a level far above her own.

Who are you?

Her tone involuntarily changed.

It doesnt matter who I am, what matters is that your actions tonight have caused trouble to everyone.

But, you have no reason to interfere.

Im also a guest at this inn. I have every right to be involved.

The female of the Tempest Three Demons gritted her teeth in frustration, her face contorted in displeasure.

At that moment, the first demon intervened.

I heard that there are as many remarkable warriors in Jianghu as there are grains of sand, but I didnt expect there to be such a person here. Since its fate that we met, why dont we tell each other our names?

Despite his friendly tone, the woman didnt answer. She was blatantly ignoring him.

The first demon exchanged a look with the third, the burly man.

Even if they didnt know the womans identity, they couldnt just retreat with their tails tucked between their legs like a frightened dog.

In the world of Jianghu, showing weakness meant being devoured by others.

Whats more, they aimed to gain fame and favor in the Jade Heaven Alliance. If they curled their tails here, they would not just be able to advance within the Jade Heaven Alliance but rather be trampled upon by others.

Let me introduce myself first. I am Go Chang-sun, the first hero of the Tempest Three Heroes.

Just as the first demon finished his introduction with a palm and fist salute, the third demon slyly moved behind the woman, preparing for a surprise attack.

The third demons fist, as big as a pot lid, aimed to strike down the woman.

Simultaneously, the first and second demons moved, swords in their hands, targeting the womans vital points.

How cowardly!

The others belatedly shouted out as they watched. To their eyes, it looked like the woman was helplessly pierced by the sword.

Bang bang bang!

The next moment, a series of heavy blows echoed chaotically.

Simultaneously, screams from the three assailants filled the air.

As people regained their senses, they saw the Tempest Three Demons sprawled on the inns floor.

A deep gash had appeared on the first demons handsome face, and the second demons pretty face became unsightly and swollen. The third demon, who had attacked the woman from behind, had both of his arms dislocated, dangling limply.

In contrast, the woman stood proudly, hands clasped behind her back.

No one managed to discern what martial art she used to defeat the Tempest Three Demons.

Except for one person, Lee Gwak.

What a fast hand technique.

What the woman had displayed was undoubtedly a hand technique.

However, the speed was beyond imagination.

Her counterattack began simultaneously with the third demons surprise attack. She twisted both the third demons arms, dislocating them, and then followed by a blow to his chest while simultaneously striking the first and second demons as well.

Despite this, her breathing remained steady, and her expression was calm. It was proof that she hadnt used her full strength.

She was a master far beyond the likes of the Tempest Three Demons.

The third demon coughed up blood as he fell to his knees. Then the woman spoke in a cold voice,

You better circulate your internal energy so that your injuries will heal quickly. I hope that in the future, you wont use your strength to bully others.

We will never forget this grudge, you bitch! If you are not afraid of the Tempest Three Heroes, then reveal your true identity!

The first demon spat out venomously. At this, the womans gaze grew even colder.

My name is Muk Seon-wol.

Muk Seon-wol? Could you be the Dark Moon Fairy of the Dragon Sky Valley?!

Thats right.

Instantly, the complexion of the Tempest Three Demons turned deathly pale.

The Dragon Sky Valley was one of the Ten Supremes. It was one of the most powerful sects in Jianghu and was called the Ruler of the West because it was located to the west of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Muk Seon-wol was the only daughter of Muk Jin-myung, the master of Dragon Sky Valley, and was widely known as the Dark Moon Fairy.

Both her background and martial prowess were incomparable to the likes of the Tempest Three Demons. If she harbored ill intentions, there would be no place for the Tempest Three Demons to hide.

W, Why are you here?

Do I need to tell you why I came to the Jade Heaven Alliance?

No, no, of course not!

Are you still planning to enter the Jade Heaven Alliance?

No, we definitely wont be entering the Jade Heaven Alliance!

The first demon quickly helped the second and third demons to their feet and rushed out of the inn without looking back.

Like her nickname, the Dark Moon Fairy, Muk Seon-wol watched them leave with a dignified demeanor.

The people inside the inn could hardly breathe as they looked at her, their faces filled with both envy and admiration.

The same was true for the members of Squad 13.

In particular, the recently joined members of Squad 13, Go Cheon-gwang and Woo Il-yeong, couldnt take their eyes off Muk Seon-wol.

To them, she was like the moon in the high sky, an unreachable existence.

Suddenly, Muk Seon-wol let out a soft sigh and then looked at Lee Gwak.

She opened her red lips.

Youre Lee Gwak, the leader of Squad 13 of the Outer Hall, right?

Thats right.

You sure have a lot of determination. Even though you belong to the Outer Hall, it must not have been easy for you to intervene.

But you were too hasty. They werent the kind of people you could handle with your abilities.

But I couldnt just stand by and do nothing, could I?

No one would care if you end up dying a dogs death. You always have to take care of your own life.

I will remember Lady Muks advice.

Muk Seon-wol looked intently at Lee Gwak, seemingly surprised by his calm response.

Like her nickname, the Dark Moon Fairy, she was beautiful. And yet, Lee Gwaks expression didnt change even under her gaze. This unexpected reaction from Lee Gwak brought a curious spark to Muk Seon-wols eyes.

May I ask you for a favor?

Please, go ahead.

I have taken a room here in this inn since the city gates were closed, but considering the current situation, it seems I wont be able to rest comfortably.

Now that everyone knew she was the Dark Moon Fairy, it was no longer possible for her to stay comfortably in this place.

Lee Gwak nodded.

How can I assist you?

Can you escort me and let me in the city?

Right now?

After whats happened, I think Id be better off resting inside the city.

This time, surprise flickered in Lee Gwaks eyes.

Given Muk Seon-wols status, even if the city gates were closed due to the late hour, they would have surely let her through.

She was not just any late-stage martial artist of Jianghu. She was the heir of one of the Ten Supremes and a member of the Ten Young Heavens, the elite young martial artists of Jianghu.

If she wished, she could enter the Jade Heaven Alliance at any time. For her to politely ask a mere squad leader for help was a refreshing experience for Lee Gwak that broke his prejudices.

Its not difficult to get you inside, but finding a place for you to stay might not be easy.

Ill take care of that myself.

Understood.

Eventually, Lee Gwak nodded.

Then lets go.

Right now?

Is it a problem?

No, not at all.

Then lets go.

Muk Seon-wol quickly gathered her small belongings and walked out of the inn. Before Lee Gwak left, he took out the money and handed it to Seok Yi-cheon.

Continue drinking, use this to settle the bill.

Youre going by yourself?

Theres no need for everyone to come. Just sit comfortably and drink. Take care of the squad members for me.

After speaking a word to each of his squad members, Lee Gwak stepped outside of the inn.

Muk Seon-wol, who was waiting outside, said,

I hope I havent disrupted your pleasant time.

Not at all. They all understand.

Thats good then.

Lee Gwak led the way.

Following him, Muk Seon-wols eyes sparkled. Lee Gwaks steps were remarkably stable.

His stride was steady and consistent, and his weight was well-distributed. This indicated that he was trained to react instantly to any situation at any time.

Muk Seon-wol recalled the moment inside the inn when Lee Gwak stepped forward.

Was he confident that he could protect himself?

One could say that it was a fearless move by an Outer Hall martial artist, but one could also think that it was because he was actually somewhat confident in his own abilities.

Lee Gwak escorted Muk Seon-wol to the outer city gate.

Hey, isnt your squads shift over?

Upon reaching the gate, Cho Mu-tak, the leader of Squad 12, looked at Lee Gwak with a puzzled expression. It was rare for Lee Gwak to enter the Jade Heaven Alliance at such a late hour after finding a house outside the city.

Lee Gwak glanced back at Muk Seon-wol behind him and replied,

I have a guest tonight.

Lady Muk Seon-wol from the Dragon Sky Valley wishes to enter the city.

Dragon Sky Valley?

Cho Mu-taks expression changed instantly.

A guest from the Dragon Sky Valley, one of the Ten Supremes, was a significant matter. Moreover, if the guest was Muk Seon-wol, the young leader of the Dragon Sky Valley and one of the Ten Young Heavens, she was a VIP among VIPs.

Are you really from the Dragon Sky Valley?

Muk Seon-wol held out a small plaque from her waist. It was a gold plaque with a flying dragon on it.

The soaring dragon was the symbol of the Dragon Sky Valley, and depending on the persons status, their plaques could either be made of gold, silver, or copper.

Only the direct lineage of the leader of the Dragon Sky Valley could possess a gold plaque. And currently, the only person in the direct lineage of the Dragon Sky Valley leader, Muk Jin-myung, was Muk Seon-wol herself.

Outer Hall Squad 12 Leader Cho Mu-tak welcomes the distinguished guest from the Dragon Sky Valley.

Thank you for your hospitality, Leader Cho. Do you think I can come inside?

Of course. I will notify the Inner Court immediately.

No need to stir up a fuss. Just quietly inform Li-yeon from the alliance leaders residence.

When you say Li-yeon, do you perhaps mean Lady Dan Li-yeon?

Cho Mu-taks eyes widened.

Dan Li-yeon was the third disciple of the alliance leader, Ja Hong-cheon. Known as the Black Martial Empress, she was a well-known martial enthusiast who rarely appeared in public due to her intense focus on martial arts training. It was surprising to hear that Muk Seon-wol had a connection with her.

Muk Seon-wol then replied with a calm expression,

Thats right.

Understood. Ill send a message inside right away. Well also assign someone to accompany you to the inner city.

No need for anyone else. Id prefer if Leader Lee continues to escort me.

Leader Lee? Understood.

Cho Mu-tak signaled Lee Gwak with a nod. Lee Gwak sighed softly, having hoped to hand over Muk Seon-wol and depart at this point. But with her request, he couldnt just leave.

Please follow me.

In the end, Lee Gwak led the way into the outer city.

He was followed by Muk Seon-wol, who gave a slight nod to Cho Mu-tak before trailing behind Lee Gwak. Cho Mu-tak watched her leave and then quickly ordered his subordinate.

Hurry and inform Lady Dan of her arrival.

The subordinate replied and dashed off, taking a shortcut.

Looking at the scene, Cho Mu-tak mumbled to himself,

A big fish has arrived. But how did that kid Gwak get involved with such an important person?

His voice was filled with envy.

Muk Seon-wol, who had been silently following Lee Gwak, suddenly asked,

How long have you been here, Leader Lee?

Im not sure. I suppose its been over ten years now.

Then you must know everything about the Jade Heaven Alliance?

Not really. Outer Hall warriors like me dont know much.

Still, you must have some knowledge about the internal affairs, right?

Ive been deployed outside for several years, so Im actually quite unfamiliar with the inner workings of the alliance.

Is that so?

No, its fine.

Muk Seon-wol quietly shook her head in response to Lee Gwaks apology.

An awkward silence lingered between them for a while. During this time, they arrived at the main gate of the inner city.

At that moment, a figure who was standing in front of the gate greeted them warmly.

Oh my, is it really you?

The woman rushing towards Muk Seon-wol was Dan Li-yeon. Muk Seon-wol also smiled broadly.

How come youre here all of a sudden without any notice? Im surprised.

It just happened that way.

The two women joyfully caught up with each other, their faces bright with smiles.

While they were happily reunited, Lee Gwak cautiously began to step back.

Thank you, Leader Lee, for guiding me here.

It was no trouble.

Muk Seon-wol suddenly expressed her gratitude.

Dan Li-yeons gaze turned towards Lee Gwak.

And you are?

Interest flickered in her eyes. She recognized Lee Gwak.
