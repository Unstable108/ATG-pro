News that an envoy from the Jade Heaven Alliance had arrived the previous night quickly spread among the people.

No one had expected the Jade Heaven Alliance to send an envoy, not even the Wudang Sect, who had invited them.

At present, the Jade Heaven Alliance was practically the public enemy of the Jianghu.

Because of that, many sects shunned them.

And after their defeat in the battle against Dragon Heaven Valley, the Jianghu’s attitude toward the Jade Heaven Alliance grew even colder.

Throughout the winter, the Jade Heaven Alliance had tightly shut its gates and rarely showed themselves. As a result, few in the martial world had even seen a warrior from the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Because it was such an unexpected event, many were surprised at the appearance of their delegation, particularly the Wudang sect, who had invited them.

To discern the Jade Heaven Alliance’s intentions, the elders and first-class disciples were immediately summoned. However, no matter how much they deliberated, they couldn’t figure out the Jade Heaven Alliance’s motives.

Ultimately, they concluded that the alliance had sent the envoy merely to save face. Still, they didn’t let their guard down completely.

They reinforced security around the guest quarters where the envoy was staying, deploying three times as many guards as usual to form an impenetrable surveillance net.

Whether or not they sensed the wary gazes from Wudang and other sects, the Jade Heaven Alliance’s delegation remained holed up in their annex and did not come out.

The mere fact that the Jade Heaven Alliance had sent an envoy further elevated the Wudang Sect’s prestige. It was proof that the Wudang Sect’s status was significant enough for the Jade Heaven Alliance to take notice.

By the next morning, sects and martial artists who hadn’t arrived the previous day began streaming in.

The delegation from the Sky High Castle, who had arrived in Sipyeon a few days earlier, also entered the Wudang Sect around noon.

With this, most of the major sects invited by the Wudang Sect had arrived.

Only then did the Wudang Taoists, including Master Cheongsong, breathe a sigh of relief. They had at least maintained appearances. However, this was far from their ultimate goal, so they remained tense.

With so many sects and martial artists arriving, Wudang buzzed with activity. Even an ordinary house would draw a crowd when holding a feast.

And this was the Wudang Sect’s grand reopening ceremony.

The Wudang Sect’s grounds were so crowded that there was hardly any space to walk. People walked around and marveled at the areas open to the public.

“Whoa! So the Taoists of Wudang built all of this themselves?”

“They say they rebuilt everything on their own after sealing the gates, without any outside help. Impressive.”

“It looks like Wudang really put their heart and soul into this.”

“If they want to reclaim their past glory, they’d need that kind of determination.”

There was no doubt in people’s minds that Wudang would rise again. The energy and atmosphere of the sect spoke for themselves.

What particularly impressed them was the demeanor of the Wudang Sect’s disciples.

They carried themselves with the composure befitting disciples of a renowned orthodox sect.

Even Lim Ji-mun, who had passed through the mountain gate, couldn’t help but marvel at the Wudang Sect’s disciples.

“To recover to this extent in just a hundred years… The legacy of the Nine Great Sects truly isn’t to be underestimated.”

A hundred years ago, during the Great Heavenly Blood War, the Nine Great Sects suffered devastating losses.

Of the nine sects that had ruled the Jianghu for centuries, four were annihilated, leaving only five to plan for the future.

Among those five sects, one had endured years of hardship and was now reopening its gates to announce its presence to the world.

Lim Ji-mun calmly ascended the mountain path.

Many people were climbing the stone steps.

Blending into the crowd, Lim Ji-mun soon found Lee Gwak.

Locating Lee Gwak wasn’t difficult—he was staying in the largest room of the Heavenly Hero Hall within the Clear Heart Pavilion.

Lee Gwak welcomed Lim Ji-mun warmly.

“Welcome.”

“Nice room. The Wudang Sect must have gone all out.”

“They’re being almost uncomfortably attentive.”

“Well, you always fatten the pig before slaughtering it.”

“Hah!”

Lee Gwak burst out laughing at Lim Ji-mun’s sharp remark. But he couldn’t completely dismiss the comment.

While Lee Gwak had been on Mount Wudang,Lim Ji-mun had roamed Sipyeon with members of the Hao Clan, gathering intelligence.

He had uncovered several valuable pieces of information—unfortunately, most of them were not favorable for Lee Gwak.

“Brother, even if you leave the mountain now, no one would blame you. Just showing up here is enough to say you’ve fulfilled your duty.”

“True.”

Lee Gwak had accepted the Wudang Sect’s invitation and come here. If he claimed urgent business and left now, no one would criticize him. His presence alone had already upheld the Wudang Sect’s prestige.

Lee Gwak knew that.

If this had been the old Lee Gwak, he might have quietly slipped away to avoid unnecessary conflict. But now, he couldn’t do that.

He was the leader of a sect.

Although his sect was smaller than the Wudang Sect and others, his followers had formed it and were watching him.

They trusted him, depended on him, and followed him.

He was their guiding light, their pillar of strength.

If he showed weakness, their morale would plummet.

Lee Gwak could not show weakness—not for their sake.

This was the most critical time for Mad Martial Sect. Their future depended on how they overcame this moment. Lee Gwak couldn’t afford to back down.

“Sigh…”

Lim Ji-mun let out a quiet sigh.

Just from Lee Gwak’s expression, he could guess what he was thinking.

Though he’d said otherwise, he didn’t truly expect Lee Gwak to leave.

If Lee Gwak had actually decided to leave, Lim Ji-mun would’ve been disappointed.

“Well, if it’s come to this, we should take full advantage of the situation.”

“How?”

“Leave that to me. You focus on Wudang’s events.”

“Alright.”

Just as Lee Gwak nodded—

“Hero Lee!”

A second generation disciple called from the outside.

“What is it?”

“Brother Gyeongmyeong has arrived from the main mountain. He asks if he may enter for a moment.”

“Tell him to come in.”

“Yes!”

As soon as the reply came, the door opened, and Gyeongmyeong entered.

“Hero Lee!”

He bowed respectfully to Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak looked puzzled.

“Taoist Gyeongmyeong, weren’t you guarding the mountain gate?”

“Most of the expected guests have arrived, so I’ve handed over duties to the disciples.”

“I see. But what brings you here?”

“Yes! It’s regarding your seating arrangement for tomorrow morning. Our sect has specially prepared a seat for you below the platform—”

“Hold on.”

Lim Ji-mun abruptly interrupted Gyeongmyeong.

Gyeongmyeong’s expression stiffened slightly at the boy’s interference—such behavior was unimaginable within the Wudang Sect.

But Lim Ji-mun paid no heed.

“I am Lim Ji-mun, the sect leader’s sworn younger brother and external affairs head of the Mad Martial Sect. Any matters concerning the sect leader’s protocol should be discussed with me.”

“……”

Gyeongmyeong blinked in surprise.

He glanced at Lee Gwak as if asking if this was serious. Lee Gwak nodded, confirming Lim Ji-mun’s words.

Lee Gwak himself was hearing the title ‘Chief External Affairs Officer’ for the first time, but if Lim Ji-mun claimed it, he had no objection to endorsing it.

Lim Ji-mun asked Gyeongmyeong,

“Aside from the Wudang Sect’s members, are any of the invited guests seated on the platform?”

“Well…”

Gyeongmyeong visibly hesitated.

The platform seats were reserved for the envoys from the Seven Great Sects and the Nine Dragons Clan.

With so many guests invited but limited space on the platform, the Wudang Sect had prioritized seating representatives from the most powerful factions on the platform, while others would be placed below based on importance.

The Wudang Sect knew Lee Gwak was modest and assumed he wouldn’t protest being seated below the platform.

They had come to inform him of his placement in a prime spot below the platform, only to hit an unexpected obstacle.

Lim Ji-mun’s expression turned cold and stern.

‘Sigh.’

Gyeongmyeong unconsciously let out a soft sigh. It was clear at a glance that this boy was no pushover.

Lim Ji-mun spoke.

“Though our Mad Martial Sect is small, we are a proper established sect, and our sect leader stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the leaders of the Seven Great Sects. Does it make sense to seat him below the platform?”

“Well… We were hoping for your understanding…”

“I won’t mince words. Unless you prepare a seat for him on the same level as the Seven Great Sect’ envoys, the sect leader and I will withdraw from the Wudang Sect immediately.”

“That can’t happen.”

Gyeongmyeong was startled by the blunt declaration.

Lim Ji-mun continued with his dry tone.

“If you extend an invitation, you must offer hospitality worthy of it. Our sect leader is too kind to protest poor treatment, but to his disciples, his dignity reflects the Mad Martial Sect’s standing. Please keep this in mind and reconsider.”

“But this has already been decided. If you could just accommodate our sect’s circumstances…”

“We can compromise on other matters, but not this one. If our request is denied, the sect leader and I will leave the Wudang Sect.”

“I… understand. I’ll convey this to the sect leader.”

“Just remember: I don’t make empty threats.”

“…Right.”

In the end, Gyeongmyeong left without accomplishing his task.

Lim Ji-mun muttered coldly,

“Who do they think they’re fooling with this nonsense?”

In the Jianghu, showing weakness invited endless probing, and appearing like easy prey made others eager to take a bite.

Though young, Lim Ji-mun understood the ways of the Jianghu better than anyone. That’s why he had treated Gyeongmyeong with such icy ruthlessness.

Lee Gwak grinned.

“You’re better at this than I am. Threatening the Wudang Sect and all.”

“I can act tough because you’re behind me, Brother. Besides, when else would we get a chance to stand firm against Wudang? They have their own guilt, so they won’t push too hard.”

“I trust you’ll handle it well.”

If Lee Gwak hadn’t trusted Lim Ji-mun, he wouldn’t have brought him into his circle.

Lim Ji-mun was someone he could rely on. That’s why Lee Gwak didn’t question his actions.

A short while later, Gyeongmyeong returned, his face flushed.

He told them that there had been a slight oversight and that Lee Gwak’s seat had been reassigned to the platform. He then offered an apology and left.

Though it was just one protest, it made the Wudang Sect realize that Lee Gwak and the Mad Martial Sect were not to be taken lightly.

Lim Ji-mun’s strategy had worked.

‘I’ll make sure no one dares to look down on the Mad Martial Sect .’

Looking out through the wide-open window at the full view of the Wudang Sect, Lim Ji-mun made a firm vow.

The third day of the Wudang Sect’s Gate-Opening Ceremony had arrived.

From early morning, the Grand Martial Arena of Wudang, where the ceremony was being held, was packed with people.

A large platform had already been erected, and entertainers hired by Wudang performed around it to liven the atmosphere.

Even the martial artists, capable of feats far beyond ordinary people thanks to their training, couldn’t help but marvel at the performers’ acrobatic movements.

“Wow!”

“Incredible!”

The crowd broke into a chorus of admiration.

Young boys carried the food that the chefs had prepared since dawn into the great hall.

With so much to see, eat, and enjoy, the crowd’s excitement reached its peak.

People waited with eager eyes for the Wudang Sect and the specially invited guests to appear. But they did not reveal themselves so easily.

Instead, the Wudang Sect’s Taoists made their entrance first.

When Cheongun, the sect’s second-in-command, appeared with his disciples, the crowd burst into cheers.

“Wooaaah!”

At the thunderous cheers, emotion washed over the faces of Cheongun and the other Taoist disciples.

To be greeted with such enthusiasm after a full century… it was enough to make them emotional.

Cheongun took a moment to compose himself before surveying the gathered martial artists.

It was time to show them the power Wudang had quietly built up over the years.

Cheongun offered a martial salute and addressed the crowd:

“I am Cheongun, an elder of the Wudang Sect. I sincerely thank everyone who has come to celebrate our sect’s opening ceremony. As you all know, Wudang is ending over a century of seclusion and re-entering the Jianghu. To mark this occasion, we have invited fellow martial artists from across the land and are honored to host this ceremony.”

“……”

The gathered martial artists held their breath as they watched Cheongun Jinin.

His voice grew even stronger, infused with internal energy.

“Our sect leader, elders, and specially invited distinguished guests will now ascend the stage. Please greet them with a thunderous round of applause.”

At Cheongun’s introduction, people began making their way up the platform.

Leading the way were Master Cheongsong and the elders, followed by martial artists from the Thousand Kingdom School, Nine Dragons Clan, and Dragon Heaven Valley.

Each time Cheongsong introduced a figure, the crowd responded with cheers.

When Mok Seon-wol stepped up as Dragon Heaven Valley’s representative, the crowd reached a fever pitch.

Though her face was half-covered with a veil, her graceful presence was enough to captivate the onlookers.

But the loudest cheers erupted for an unexpected figure.

“Wooaaah! It’s Hero Lee Gwak!”

“The Sura Blade!”

It was the moment Lee Gwak stepped onto the stage.

The crowd’s reaction was beyond what the Wudang Sect members had anticipated, and their expressions visibly stiffened.

The cheers for Lee Gwak far exceeded their expectations.

The benevolent expression on Cheongsong’s face hardened into resolve.

‘As expected, that man…’

Suddenly, his gaze shifted toward Jinghae, standing behind the elders.

At that moment, Jinghae was glaring at Lee Gwak as if he wanted to tear him apart.
