The Unsan Escort Agency had a long history of successfully completing countless missions. Their experience, accumulated over 150 years, was so extensive that other agencies could hardly match it.

Their true worth especially shone when camping outdoors.

Hm!

A gleam of admiration appeared in Lee Gwak’s eyes.

A wooden fortress had appeared in the barren wilderness.

There was no other way to describe it but as a fortress.

When it was time to camp, the porters arranged the wagons in a circle to form walls. The lower parts of the wagons were loaded with planks of unknown purpose, and when these were inserted into the connecting parts between the wagons, they became a seamless fortress wall.

Creak

When a handle on the outer wall of a wagon was turned, another wall rose from the existing one. Its height reached nearly ten feet.

The group was surrounded by a barrier that even a skilled martial artist would find difficult to cross. It was difficult to get out from the inside, but even more impossible to get in from the outside.

In other words, a small castle or fortress had been built in the middle of the wilderness.

Seol Cheon-bok approached Lee Gwak.

“Surprised?”

“Honestly, I’m amazed.”

“It’s no wonder the Unsan Escort Agency is considered the best in the region. Even a single, ordinary-looking wagon contains 150 years of accumulated experience. Individually, they might not seem like much, but when you connect more than ten wagons like this, it becomes a magnificent fortress. Thanks to that, we can post just a couple of guards, and everyone else can rest comfortably inside the safe fortress.”

“That’s certainly true.”

Lee Gwak nodded in agreement.

The porters, who had quickly connected the wagons to form the fortress, then began to prepare dinner.

Until now, the merchant bands or escort agencies Lee Gwak had traveled with typically relied on simple meals such as dried rations or jerky. So he thought the Unsan Escort Agency would be the same, but he was mistaken.

The porters took out pots and bowls from the wagon at the very rear and started cooking. They poured the contents of a sack into a pot filled with water and boiled it vigorously.

The sack contained a mixture of dried grain powder, vegetables, and smoked meat. Without any additional seasoning or cooking, the contents cooked into a hearty meat porridge.

The wagon at the very rear was stocked with such supplies.Thanks to that, even when camping like this, they could enjoy a great meal without any troublesome processes.

First, the members of the Unsan Escort Agency received their portions, and then food was provided to the hired vagrants.

“Wow! This is delicious.”

Lee Cheong cautiously took a bite and exclaimed in amazement.

Although it wasn’t as tasty as a properly made meal, it was unbelievably good for something eaten in the wilderness.

“It’s really delicious.”

Lee Gwak couldn’t help expressing his admiration.

Song Jae-Gyeong, who was beside him, burst into hearty laughter.

“Ha ha! Isn’t it? That’s why I love being temporarily hired as an escort by the Unsan Escort Agency.”

“I can understand that.”

Lee Gwak agreed with Song Jae-gyeong’s enthusiasm.

The Unsan Escort Agency was undeniably impressive.

If you invest over a hundred years into a single profession, you can develop this much. It’s the same with martial sects. The so-called prestigious sects have developed their teachings over more than a hundred years, so it’s natural that new sects can’t catch up.

This thought darkened Lee Gwak’s expression momentarily, but he quickly dismissed it and focused on his meal.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong ate their meal with great enjoyment. The quantity seemed a bit lacking, but Lee Gwak thought this amount was just right.

Eating too much would only lead to sluggishness, a rare and dangerous drawback for a martial artist.

Lee Gwak hadn’t held a blade in his hand for the past three years.

While he had achieved deeper insight during that time, his body was no longer as finely tuned as that of a seasoned martial artist. The silver lining was that his physical condition was quickly returning to its former state since re-entering the Jianghu.

It was a positive sign.

No matter how profound one’s insights, they were meaningless without a capable body.

Fortunately, Lee Gwak had not yet met an opponent who required his full strength, but he couldn’t guarantee that would always be the case.

The Jianghu was vast, and the saying that “the world is full of martial masters like grains of sand” wasn’t said for nothing.

Maintaining friendly relations with them would be fine, but since human affairs don’t always go as planned, he needed to be fully prepared in advance.

Lee Gwak took Lee Cheong to a secluded spot. He then began to loosen up Lee Cheong’s body by practicing the Eight Snakes Art

Stretching and twisting his muscles, Lee Gwak utilized the Eight Snakes Art to strengthen his son’s meridians and qi flow.

Incorporating elements of the Yoga Secret Manuals, the Eight Snakes Art made muscles both strong and flexible while reshaping the skeleton to optimize it for martial arts.

Lee Gwak always had Lee Cheong loosen up his body like this before practicing martial arts. He firmly believed in their effectiveness, based on his personal experience. However, to others, their actions looked somewhat ridiculous.

The way they twisted and bent resembled the stunts of acrobats or entertainers rather than martial artists. They wondered how such actions could help in learning martial arts.

Some of the vagrants and escorts openly ridiculed the actions of Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong.

“Tsk! In this day and age, teaching with such primitive methods. He’ll miss the crucial period for building a proper foundation in martial arts.”

“Exactly. At this rate, the father’s just ruining the boy’s future.”

“Tsk tsk! That’s why they say, ‘A strict teacher produces outstanding disciples.’ Without a capable master, how can the child grow strong?”

They thought they were whispering quietly, but their words sounded like thunder in Lee Gwak’s ears. However, he didn’t pay any attention to what they were saying.

It didn’t matter what others said or criticized.

He had already seen sufficient results with his own methods and was confident he could guide Lee Cheong correctly based on his own experience.

Some might see this as rather arrogant, but because he had confidence in himself, he wasn’t swayed by others’ words.

The same went for Lee Cheong.

No matter what others said, he loosened up his body in the way Lee Gwak had taught him.

In truth, Lee Cheong was so engrossed that he didn’t even hear their derogatory remarks.

“Hoo!”

Finally, Lee Cheong finished his warm-up exercises, breathing heavily.

Lee Gwak smiled. In his eyes, it seemed that Lee Cheong had properly loosened up his body.

Lee Gwak nodded and spoke.

‘Let’s get started.’

‘Yes!’

Lee Cheong replied and drew his blade.

When the young boy wielded a real blade, those who had been watching nearby looked on with intrigued eyes.

“Hmm!”

Go Chang-seon, the head escort of the Unsan Escort Agency, looked at Lee Cheong with an interested expression.

Unlike the vagrants and escorts who had been gossiping earlier, he did not make the mistake of evaluating Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong with their limited perspectives.

He didn’t know the true extent of Lee Gwak’s skills, but he was aware that the branch leader of the Hao Clan had written a recommendation letter for him, indicating that he was an excellent martial artist.

There was no way such a martial artist would teach his son useless methods. This made him observe Lee Cheong even more carefully, trying to gauge Lee Gwak’s level through the martial arts his son was practicing.

It was then.

Thud!

With a powerful forward step, Lee Cheong thrust his blade with all his might.

Mountain Splitting Slash

It was the first technique of the Eight Sects Sword Art.

The first move of the Eight Sects Sword Art, its name aptly described a straight thrust piercing through a mountain. However, it contained the profound principles that Lee Gwak had contemplated his entire life.

Without understanding such profundity, it would appear no different from any ordinary third-rate martial art.

“Heh heh! What’s that supposed to be?”

“Isn’t he cute?”

Some of the vagrants and escort guards burst into laughter.

Whoosh!

Following the Mountain Splitting Slash, Lee Cheong executed the next technique, Raging Tidal Force.

It was a technique imbued with a fierce momentum, as if angry waves were crushing a massive rock.

Lee Gwak always told Lee Cheong that the mindset was important.

He insisted that the momentum would change depending on what mindset one used when executing the sword technique.

As if I myself am the angry wave…

Lee Cheong didn’t forget Lee Gwak’s teachings.

Though his internal energy wasn’t yet sufficient to unleash the technique’s full power, the ferocity in his movement was undeniable.

“Mm!”

“Hmm!”

Those who had been laughing at Lee Cheong tilted their heads. Instinctively, they sensed that there was something different about his movements. However, not knowing exactly what was different, they could only wear puzzled expressions.

Swish!

Lee Cheong then performed the third technique, Shadowless Strike.

Not having fully mastered it yet, his movements were still clumsy. However, the momentum was extremely intense.

“Ha!”

Go Chang-seon unknowingly let out an exclamation.

He could somewhat recognize how powerful the seemingly simple techniques executed by Lee Cheong were. That’s why he was impressed.

This is not a martial art to be taken lightly. If the son is at this level, then the father must be…

Go Chang-seon looked at Lee Gwak with a renewed expression.

Only now did he get an idea of Lee Gwak’s level.

“Hmm! Perhaps he’s around the same level as me?”

Go Chang-seon furrowed his brows.

If his estimation was correct, Lee Gwak wasn’t someone he could easily use and discard.

“Well, I can consider it as having a decent card hidden up my sleeve.”

That was more than sufficient.

The question was whether Lee Gwak was truly trustworthy, but since the Hao Clan’s branch leader vouched for him, there was no issue.

“Good.”

Having organized his thoughts, Go Chang-seon smiled.

With a more relaxed mind, he continued to watch Lee Cheong train.

Lee Cheong repeatedly performed the initial three techniques.

He knew all eight forms of the technique, but since he hadn’t fully grasped their essence yet, he couldn’t execute them properly.

Lee Gwak hoped that, even if it took longer, Lee Cheong would properly go through each stage to master the martial arts. Because of that, he put the most effort into teaching the initial three techniques of the Eight Sects Sword Art.

As the latter techniques required more complex principles and insights, they were essentially extensions of the initial three. Thus, Lee Gwak took special care in teaching the basics.

Fortunately, Lee Cheong understood and faithfully followed Lee Gwak’s intentions.

He didn’t care about the gazes of others.

In any case, just by watching the techniques, they couldn’t grasp the profundity of the Eight Sects Sword Art. What others saw was merely the surface—they couldn’t possibly know about the internal energy manipulation.

Knowing this, Lee Cheong could train with his full effort even in front of everyone.

Swish!

Each time he executed the forms, sharp whistling sounds filled the air.

As time passed, Lee Cheong’s skills became more refined and sharper.

“Ahem.”

Only then did those who had initially underestimated Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong feel a twinge of embarrassment, their expressions turning awkward.

Even those with untrained eyes could sense that Lee Cheong’s movements were extraordinary.

Although his techniques were incomplete and many aspects were clumsy, his firm resolve was clearly revealed in his momentum.

Lee Cheong’s entire body was drenched in sweat. But the sweat immediately evaporated into steam. The heat from within his body was released externally, evaporating the sweat.

His practice continued nonstop for nearly half an hour.

“Truly impressive.”

“For such a young child to practice continuously without rest.”

Now, many looked at Lee Cheong with expressions of admiration. They themselves weren’t confident they could practice without resting for such a long time.

Those who had initially ridiculed Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong were too embarrassed to say anything. Some even quietly slipped away among the crowd.

At that moment, Lee Gwak’s voice echoed.

“That’s enough! We’ll stop here for today.”

Thud!

Instead of replying, Lee Cheong stomped his foot powerfully, finishing all his movements.

“Hoo!”

He exhaled the breath he had been holding in.

His face was flushed red as he gasped for air.

Lee Gwak handed him a towel.

“Use this to wipe your body.”

“Yes!”

“You did well.”

“Really?”

“You’ve improved compared to before.”

“Hehe!”

A joyful expression appeared on Lee Cheong’s face. He was happy to be praised by Lee Gwak. Above all, he was glad to hear that he had made progress compared to before.

Since there was no suitable place nearby to wash, he meticulously wiped his sweat with the towel.

By the time he had wiped off all his sweat, his heavy breathing had somewhat stabilized.

Lee Cheong savored the pleasant exhaustion he felt.

Though his body was tired, he liked this kind of exhaustion.

Holding a wooden bowl, he walked over to the campfire in the center.

Near the campfire, a large water container was set up. Those who were thirsty would scoop water from here to drink.

As Lee Cheong scooped water from the container and brought it to his lips—

“What was that clumsy movement of yours?”

A cold voice reached him.

When he looked up, he saw a boy about fourteen or fifteen years old standing with his arms crossed.

Looking down at him with an arrogant expression was Nam Jin-woon, the nephew of Nam Woo-chang, the owner of the Unsan Escort Agency.
