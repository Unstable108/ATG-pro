Manhwa: Chapter 16

Episode 5. Alone and Motivated (1)

The new leader of Squad 13 introduced himself as Seo Jong-myeong.

Lee Gwak looked at Seo Jong-myeong with a slight frown. He felt an inexplicable discomfort.

Though the organization had been restructured, the Outer Hall had its unique atmosphere. This casual aura was typically visible in ones demeanor and actions. But Seo Jong-myeong didnt exhibit any of the Outer Halls unique atmosphere.

His sharp eyes and aura suggested that he came from a place where tension was pervasive.

He must have come from the Inner Court.

Lee Gwak didnt know why a martial artist from the Inner Court would be dispatched to the Outer Hall, but he felt uneasy about it.

It was then.

Look at this. Are you sizing me up?

The corners of Seo Jong-myeongs eyes lifted slightly.

No, Im not.

You little! With that look in your eyes, what do you mean, no?

Seo Jong-myeongs voice rose slightly. Lee Gwak instantly felt tense, realizing that the new leader was not someone to be taken lightly.

Seemingly sensing Lee Gwaks internal change, Seo Jong-myeong suddenly chuckled.

Its okay, man. Relax. I wont eat you.

Im not here to mess with you. I just came to see you because youre the only member of the squad. I heard you were paralyzed, so I had to check if you were still alive. Hehe!

Seo Jong-myeong suddenly chuckled with a hehe. His laugh was strangely twisted.

Then, Lee Gwak asked,

Im the only member of the squad?

Like I said, its just you for now. They said theyll assign more members later.

What happened to you, anyway? I heard you were lying down because of paralysis.

I was lucky enough to get up recently.

Hmm! Youre damn lucky, then. If you have any luck to spare, share it with me.

Though he said so, he didnt look convinced.

He turned away.

If you can move, then come back to the dormitory. Im the squad leader after all, its a little embarrassing for me to be all alone.

Understood.

Seo Jong-myeong waved his hand and walked away.

Lee Gwak stood still, watching the retreating figure of Seo Jong-myeong.

As if waiting for him to change, everything around him also began to change.

No matter how the world changes, I must not be shaken.

When Lee Gwak returned to the Outer Hall, many things had changed. The most significant changes were the atmosphere and the buildings of the Outer Hall.

In the past, they all lived together in the dormitory without distinction between squads. But now, they were given separate living quarters. Each area was separated by a high wall and affiliation was strictly distinguished.

The relaxed atmosphere from before could no longer be found anywhere. Strict discipline was enforced, and even the martial artists of the Outer Hall looked tense, their faces unreadable and unrecognizable.

While Lee Gwak was practicing the Eight Snakes Art in a cramped room, something big was happening in the outside world.

The Jade Heaven Alliance and the Celestial Demon Union had clashed.

The reason for this is unknown, but both sides have suffered considerable losses, and the atmosphere was becoming increasingly hostile.

While it was still just sporadic battles for now, the prevailing public opinion was that if things continued at this rate, it could become a replay of the Great Heavenly Blood War from a hundred years ago.

Because of this, the martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance were also quite anxious.

In this unfamiliar atmosphere, even Lee Gwak couldnt help but be slightly flustered. However, that was only for a moment, he soon regained his usual composure.

The biggest change after mastering the Eight Snakes Art was being able to calm his mind at any time.

Have you arrived?

Seo Jong-myeong, who was sitting in the front yard of the lodging, recognized Lee Gwak as he approached.

Dont just stand there idly, sit down somewhere.

Are we really the only ones here?

I told you, Squad members have not been assigned yet. So until then, you are exempted from all duties, just rest.

Just rest is that okay?

As long as you dont bother me.

Upon hearing Seo Jong-myeongs words, Lee Gwak blinked his eyes. He couldnt quite grasp what was going on.

Seo Jong-myeong waved his hand dismissively.

Snap out of it. Stop rolling your eyes and go somewhere where I cant see you.

Lee Gwak replied and went to the opposite side of Seo Jong-myeong. It was a place where training weapons were kept.

There were single-edged swords, spears, double-edged swords, polearms, and other weapons of various kinds.

As Lee Gwak looked at the weapons, his eyes lit up with excitement.

It had been a year since he saw any weapons.

The fact that he had once thought he might never hold one made it all the more impressive.

What Lee Gwak reached out and grabbed was a simple-shaped single-edged sword or a dao.

The dao was the most common weapon used by the Jade Heaven Alliances Outer Hall martial artists. It was easier to learn compared to double-edged swords, and most importantly, it was the most convenient to carry.

Lee Gwak had also learned dao techniques. So he was more familiar with it than any other weapon.

Shing! Shing!

Lee Gwak swung the sword lightly.

It had been so long since hed held the sword that it felt unfamiliar. Still, he didnt stop swinging.

Everything felt foreign.

Basic movements, thrusts, defensive stances, all the things he had learned over the past five years were a mess. He hadnt achieved much even back then, and since he hadnt touched a weapon in a year, it was only natural that his body had forgotten.

Lee Gwak let out a deep sigh.

He was prepared for this, but seeing it for himself was even more disappointing. However, he was not discouraged.

He would just have to take it one day at a time.

Just as he had desperately learned the Eight Snakes Art, he could relearn sword techniques from the beginning. Thats what Lee Gwak thought.

If he wasnt going to be sent on a mission for a while, he would have time to spare. Time was plenty.

Lee Gwak rummaged through his memory and began to unfold sword techniques.

Luminous Sword Art.

It was a basic move that any martial artist in the Outer Hall would know.

The technique was designed to maximize the use and versatility of the dao, such as slashing and stabbing. It also didnt consume much internal energy, so it was perfect for lower-ranked martial artists to learn. However, it clearly had its limitations, so those who aspired to higher realms were advised to stay away from it.

Lee Gwak knew that, but he had no other choice right now.

The Luminous Sword Art consisted mainly of seven basic movements.

Lee Gwak performed the first basic movement up to the seventh in sequence.

In an instant, his face flushed bright red. He was quickly out of breath.

Although he had worked diligently on his physique over the past winter, moving and performing martial arts was a different matter altogether.

Although his muscles and bones had become flexible enough to make the execution of movements easy, his breathing was still off. In the end, Lee Gwak had to lie on the ground, unable to complete even half of the sequence, catching his breath.

Huff! Huff!

Gasps came out of his mouth.

It was tempting to just lie on the ground and rest. But he barely resisted the temptation.

If he rests now, he will go back to his old self, back to the days when he gave up on everything easily.

Lee Gwak forced himself back to his feet, a look of determination on his face.

Lets start again from the beginning.

He unfolded the Eight Snakes Art again from the start.

Even though he was tired, there was more strength in his movements compared to the beginning. But he still wasnt satisfied.

Lee Gwak truly gave it his all. This was the first time in his life that he had ever practiced martial arts with such vigor.

Though his body was exhausted and his breath was on the edge of his lungs, Lee Gwak was happy. Then, a voice broke his moment.

You! What are you doing?

The owner of that disdainful voice came from none other than Seo Jong-myeong. Coming to his senses, Lee Gwak found Seo Jong-myeong looking at him with contemptuous eyes.

Excuse me?

Are you doing a crippled sword dance or something? How would that be useful when youre so slow?

Upon Seo Jong-myeongs harsh words, Lee Gwak bit his lips.

Is my Luminous Sword Art really that terrible?

Its so bad it rots my eyes.

Why should I?

Arent you the squad leader?

Seo Jong-myeong made a face as if he couldnt believe it.

But Lee Gwak didnt give up and asked,

So you wont?

Of course not.

Why not? There are no other members in Squad 13 besides me. Isnt it beneficial for you if I become stronger?

Lee Gwaks gaze was uncharacteristically provocative. However, it wasnt enough to provoke Seo Jong-myeong.

Ha! Do you think such high-sounding logic will work? I told you not to bother me.

Squad leader!

Lee Gwak shouted loudly, but Seo Jong-myeong pretended not to hear him and walked back inside his room.

Left alone, Lee Gwak stared at Seo Jong-myeongs door for a long time. But the firmly closed door showed no sign of opening.

No matter what you say, I wont give up.

The moment he gives up here, he will once again become a dog.

He couldnt go back to those days when he was only mediocre and lacked ambition.

Lee Gwak once again gripped the handle of his sword. Then, he began to unfold the Luminous Sword Art.

Swish, swish, swish!

In the deserted courtyard, only the sound of Lee Gwak swinging his sword could be heard.

By the time Lee Gwak finished his training, it was almost evening. He was so exhausted he couldnt even lift a finger. He desperately wanted to lie down and sleep right there. However, he forced himself to resist the temptation and began practicing the Eight Snakes Art.

The first snake that had been dormant woke up and moved.

As the first snake moved, the second snake woke up, and the third and fourth snakes responded as well.

By now, Lee Gwak clearly understood the roles each of the four snakes played.

If the first snake was heavy and provided balance, the second snake was violent and fueled his energy. The third snake expanded his senses, and the fourth snake greedily pulled in qi. Because of this, Lee Gwaks qi was growing day by day.

Lee Gwaks day was simple.

He trained in the Eight Snakes Art at dawn and night, and during the day he mastered the Luminous Sword Art.

Since there were only two of them in the dormitory, he didnt have to worry about anyone seeing him, so he focused even more on mastering the Luminous Sword Art.

Seo Jong-myeong frowned as he watched Lee Gwak.

He found Lee Gwak, who was soaked in sweat yet still smiling, somewhat annoying. Lee Gwak seemed like a man obsessed with martial arts.

Seo Jong-myeong couldnt understand what was so enjoyable about mastering the Luminous Sword Art, a martial art which nobody in the Jade Heaven Alliance cared about.

Crazy bastard.

That was Seo Jong-myeongs impression of Lee Gwak.

But that didnt mean he thought highly of Lee Gwak. No matter how diligently Lee Gwak learned the Luminous Sword Art, there were clear limits.

Among the martial arts in the Jade Heaven Alliance, hardly any were weaker than the Luminous Sword Art. Even the weakest martial art Seo Jong-myeong knew was far stronger than the Luminous Sword Art.

The biggest problem was that the path to advancing the Luminous Sword Art was blocked. Even if one mastered the Luminous Sword Art, they would still just remain an average martial artist. Yet Lee Gwak continued to swing his sword every day without giving up.

Finally, Seo Jong-myeong couldnt hold back and spoke,

Dont waste your time practicing such a useless martial art.

What do you mean?

Even if you master the Luminous Sword Art, theres a clear limit to how high you can climb with it. Youre ultimately limited to being an Outer Hall martial artist with something like that. No one will recognize you.

Im not doing this to be recognized.

W are you training so hard then? Every human has the desire to be recognized by others. Do you think youre any different? But theres an obvious limit to what that martial art can do. No matter how desperately you try, youre still just a pawn on a chessboard.

But I should at least try, shouldnt I?

Youre a stubborn fool. Fine, Ill show what reality is like.

Draw your sword and attack me.

Seo Jong-myeong drew his sword and aimed at Lee Gwak.

Come at me. Ill show you your limits.

There was a hint of irritation in his voice.
