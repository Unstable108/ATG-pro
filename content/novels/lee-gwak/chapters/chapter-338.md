In the Dragon Heaven Valley, there was a forbidden area that no one could access.

Surrounded by a year-round gray mist, this forbidden area was filled with layers of mechanical traps and hidden experts, effectively preventing any outsiders from entering.

Only those bearing the surname Muk were permitted entry. Currently, the only martial artist in Dragon Heaven Valley with the surname Muk was Muk Seon-wol.

As Muk Seon-wol stepped into the gray mist, it clung to her body as if it were a living entity, causing her to shudder slightly.

Despite having experienced this several times, the unpleasant feeling never became familiar. However, entering the forbidden area was a necessity.

The gray mist could differentiate between those of the Muk lineage and others. It allowed those with Muk blood to pass, but it was a deadly poison to those who were not.

Muk Seon-wol did not understand the principle behind this phenomenon. As far as she knew, the forbidden area had existed since the founding of Dragon Heaven Valley.

If one was not recognized by the gray mist, numerous traps and mechanisms within the forbidden area would activate, leading to the intruder’s death.

Once she passed through the mist, a world of beauty unfolded before her.

It was hard to believe that such a breathtaking landscape was hidden behind the gloomy gray fog.

A small waterfall cascaded into a clear pond, and a variety of exotic flowers and plants formed a scene so picturesque it resembled a celestial realm.

Muk Seon-wol bit her lip gently.

Despite the beauty of the scenery, one thing was missing.

Life.

Despite the abundance of flowers, there were no bees or butterflies. There was plenty of food, but not a single deer or rabbit in sight.

Muk Seon-wol knew the reason.

A man was sitting cross legged on a large stone platform next to the pond.

His long grey hair covered his face and fell down to his waist. His thick beard covered the lower half of his face and reached down to his chest.

Uniquely, his arms and legs were restrained by chains as thick as a child’s arm. These chains were firmly attached to the stone platform, which was carved from a massive rock.

The visible part of the stone platform was merely the tip of a huge rock.

Amidst the strands of grey hair, the man’s eyes flickered fiercely.

The intense aura emanating from him prevented any living creatures from approaching.

As Muk Seon-wol drew closer, she felt a suffocating sensation but maintained her composure and knelt on one knee before the man.

“Father.”

In Dragon Heaven Valley, there was only one man who Muk Seon-wol would call father.

Seven-Colored Martial Emperor Muk Jin-myeong.

He sat on the stone platform, appearing like a madman.

“Have you come?”

“Yes, Father. How are you feeling?”

“Not bad.”

Muk Jin-myeong’s reply made Muk Seon-wol’s expression stiffen slightly.

The world believed that Muk Jin-myeong was in seclusion, undertaking intense meditation to reach a higher state of enlightenment.

This was only half true.

He was indeed in deep training, but it was not to gain enlightenment—it was to suppress his heart demon.

Muk Jin-myeong was a Martial Maniac.

He lived obsessively for the martial arts and trained fiercely every day to attain higher enlightenment. However, he overtrained himself into madness.

If he had taken care of himself when the symptoms first appeared, he would have quickly overcome the heart demon. But Muk Jin-myeong did not stop training, and eventually, he missed the opportunity to heal.

The Heart Demon manifests in various ways. In his case, it resulted in violent fits triggered by excess yin energy—meaning that every full moon, he would lose control and rampage.

To prevent himself from harming the Dragon Heaven Valley, Muk Jin-myeong had voluntarily confined himself within the forbidden area and shackled himself in chains.

A desperate measure to protect those around him.

During moments of clarity, he continued training relentlessly, seeking a way to overcome his affliction. His condition had improved significantly, but he had not yet completely freed himself from it.

That’s why Muk Jin-myeong had vanished from the public eye.

Since his affliction took hold, Muk Seon-wol had done everything in her power to lead Dragon Heaven Valley. She had given it her all, but there were times when the burden was too great.

In those moments, she sought out Muk Jin-myeong.

Though half-mad, he was still her father by blood.

Seeing him brought her a sense of peace.

Muk Jin-myeong stared at Muk Seon-wol for a while before speaking.

“So, what is the situation in the valley? Are we still at a stalemate with the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

“Yes, that’s why we decided to strengthen our ties with the Martial Sword Troupe.”

“With the Martial Sword Troupe?”

Muk Jin-myeong frowned, clearly displeased.

He neither liked nor trusted Yu-mun sang, the leader of Martial Sword Troupe.

Muk Seon-wol explained, somewhat defensively.

“It was a necessary decision. Recently, the Jade Heaven Alliance has been concentrating its forces near our Valley. It seems they intend to settle things once and for all.”

“Hmph! If only my body were whole, I would sweep those pests away in an instant.”

A fierce, oppressive qi burst forth from Muk Jin-myeong’s body.

The sheer intensity of it was enough to make even Muk Seon-wol shudder.

“Never let your guard down. For now, necessity may force us to align with them, but neither the Martial Sword Troupe nor Yu Mun-sang are to be trusted.”

“I understand.”

Muk Seon-wol nodded.

Muk Jin-myeong studied her face in silence.

“My daughter.”

“Yes, Father?”

“I regret placing such a heavy burden upon you. But once I achieve my grand breakthrough, I will cast away this affliction for good. Just hold on a little longer.”

“I will.”

“I trust you.”

Muk Jin-myeong firmly gripped Muk Seon-wol’s small shoulders.

The weight of his hands made her bite her lip.

After the supply convoy was ambushed, the atmosphere in Hundred Eyes Fortress changed dramatically.

Laughter vanished from the faces of the people, replaced by the heavy air of impending battle.

An Pyeong-san, the lord of Hundred Eyes Fortress gathered the leaders to discuss countermeasures, but there were no immediate solutions.

Ultimately, An Pyeongsan decided to reinforce the fortress’s defenses and increase patrols.

Lee Gwak had wanted to join the scouts, but An Pyeong-san refused to allow the Black Wind Squad to participate.

After all, the attackers had been wandering mercenaries.

Although the Black Wind Squad had successfully completed their mission, all the other mercenaries had perished. Under such circumstances, trusting them completely was impossible.

In the end, Lee Gwak had no choice but to return to Taegang with the Black Wind Squad, achieving nothing.

An Pyeong-san stood atop the fortress wall, watching their retreating figures.

He turned to Ma Yeon-san, who stood beside him.

“Send a messenger pigeon to the main stronghold. Have them keep a close eye on the Black Wind Squad.”

“Keep an eye on them? Do you suspect something?”

“Does it make sense to you that they repelled the Mad Wolf Squad on their own?”

“Well….”

“I don’t understand it either. But I can’t interrogate those who have contributed to our cause, so we will observe them instead.”

“Understood. I will send the message.”

“Hmm.”

An Pyeongsan nodded, watching the Black Wind Squad disappear into the distance.

Lee Gwak scratched the back of his head.

The stares he felt on his back were intense, as if they were burning holes into him.

‘As expected, they’re suspicious.’

He shook his head slightly.

It was inevitable. Things might get annoying in the future, but the information he had gained made it worth it.

Seeing the Hundred Eyes Fortress first hand had been a powerful experience.

Somewhere beyond that battlefield, Seok Yi-cheon was out there. The thought of him gnawed at Lee Gwak.

But for now, all he could do was wait in Taegang.

Meanwhile, Lee Chi-sang and the Black Wind Squad glanced at Lee Gwak.

They didn’t understand him.

Had they possessed his skills, they would have revealed their true abilities and claimed the rewards they deserved.

If a master like Lee Gwak declared himself, even Dragon Heaven Valley would shower him with wealth and women just to recruit him.

To a wandering warrior, there was no greater luxury.

And yet, for some reason, Lee Gwak remained silent.

Lee Chi-sang made up his mind.

‘As soon as we return to Taegang, I’ll cancel our contract with the Dragon Heaven Valley and return home.’

The lower-ranked vagrants were always more sensitive to the shifting tides of war. Moreover, the Black Wind Squad had clashed directly with the Wild Wolf Corps.

“Soon, this entire region will be engulfed in war. And people like us—wandering vagrants caught in the middle—will be the first to die.”

No matter how much money was at stake, it wasn’t worth more than one’s life.

Over time, Lee Chi-sang had accumulated a fair amount of wealth through his contract with the Dragon Heaven Valley. But if he died, that wealth would be meaningless.

He resolved to return home and spend his money freely.

His subordinates felt the same way. None of them wanted to linger here and end up dying a dog’s death.

Though it had taken three days to reach Hundred Eyes Fortress, the return trip to Taegang took only half that time.

It seemed that word of the attack on the Black Wind Squad and the other mercenaries had spread, as the atmosphere in Taegang had noticeably stiffened.

Lee Gwak parted ways with the Black Wind Squad and walked through the streets alone.

During the few days he had been away, the town seemed to have become more crowded with martial artists.

Just as he was observing the people moving about, he heard a murmur.

“That’s the Martial Sword Troupe.”

“Martial Sword Troupe has sent reinforcements!”

“Wooooah!”

Suddenly, a roar of cheers erupted from the opposite side of the street.

Naturally, Lee Gwak’s gaze followed.

Martial Sword Troupe?

His brows furrowed.

He had a bad history with them.

When he returned to the Jianghu, the fleet that had attacked his ship had been supported by none other than the Martial Sword Troupe.

Martial Sword Troupe’s leader, Yu Mun-sang, had used a pirate fleet to amass a fortune, and with that wealth, he had expanded the Martial Sword Troupe to what it was today.

Yu Mun-sang hadn’t built the Martial Sword Troupe through honorable means, but rather through underhanded schemes.

The murmurs of the crowd grew louder.

The procession of the Martial Sword Troupe approached the spot where Lee Gwak was standing.

Lee Gwak stood among the people and watched the procession of the Martial Sword Troupe.

There were over a thousand men, an overwhelming force crossing the streets.

At the front of the procession, he saw a familiar face.

A young martial artist sat atop a massive horse, his piercing eyes sweeping over the surroundings like those of a tiger. His presence alone was overwhelming. The soaring black dragon emblem on his arm guard was particularly clear.

“Woo Mun-pae!”

It was Woo Mun-pae, the Young Master of Martial Sword Troupe.

Woo Mun-pae sat on the horse with his arms crossed, not even holding the reins. His posture exuded arrogance, yet it suited him perfectly.

From his high vantage point, Woo Mun-pae surveyed the crowd that had gathered to see him.

His aura exuded supreme confidence—there was nothing he feared, nothing that could stand in his way.

Those who met his gaze instinctively lowered their heads or shrank back.

“He truly is incredible.”

“They say the Young Master of Martial Sword Troupe is a dragon among men, and it seems the rumors were true.”

“This is reassuring. I feel safe now.”

Although Dragon Heaven Valley and the Martial Sword Troupe had been allied against the Jade Heaven Alliance for some time, this was the first time such a massive force had entered Taegang.

And to top it off, their leader was Woo Mun-pae himself.

That fact alone reassured many.

A subtle smile played at the corner of Woo Mun-pae’s lips.

He tried to hide it, but he couldn’t deny that he enjoyed being the centre of attention.

He thrived on admiration.

At that moment –

“It’s the young master.”

“Dragon Heaven Valley’s leadership has come to welcome them.”

The crowd stirred once more.

From the opposite side, Muk Seon-wol approached, leading the leadership of Dragon Heaven Valley.

Woo Mun-pae’s brow twitched slightly at the sight of her.

He had met countless women, embraced just as many.

But never before had he seen a woman so stunningly beautiful and yet radiating such noble dignity.

As she drew closer, Woo Mun-pae slowly dismounted.

Muk Seon-wol was the first to greet him.

“I am Muk Seon-wol, Young Master of Dragon Heaven Valley. I greet Young Master Woo Mun-pae of Martial Sword Troupe. Thank you for personally leading reinforcements here.”

“Haha! A pleasure to meet you, Lady Muk. How could I stand idly by when facing such a great evil as the Jade Heaven Alliance? Fear not—I have brought our finest martial artists.”

“That alone is reassuring. Please, let us proceed to the valley.”

“Haha! Let’s do that.”

With a hearty laugh, Woo Mun-pae walked beside Muk Seon-wol.

Behind them, a thousand elite martial artists of the Martial Sword Troupe followed.

It was an awe-inspiring sight.

“Wooooah!”

“Incredible!”

The people cheered as they passed.

But amidst the excited crowd, Lee Gwak’s eyes gleamed sharply.

While most were focused on Woo Mun-pae and Muk Seon-wol, he was watching someone else entirely.

Among the Martial Sword Troupe martial artists, there was a lone woman walking silently.

She wore a wide bamboo hat that obscured her face, making it impossible to discern her identity.

Yet, there was something unmistakably familiar about the aura she exuded.

She carried herself with the calm stillness of a tranquil sea—an unshakable serenity.

Lee Gwak had encountered such a presence once before.

“Sa Yeon-hee”
