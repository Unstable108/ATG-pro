Ahn Yu-san’s eyes fluttered nervously.

“The Nine Shadows Fleet…”

He had already been considering developing land routes because of the Nine Shadows Fleet. Such was the burden the Nine Shadows Fleet represented.

Ahn Yu-san’s gaze turned towards the captain.

“What should we do?”

“I don’t know if it’s possible, but I’ll try to shake them off.”

The captain gritted his teeth.

They had prepared for such a situation by having numerous martial artists on board, but there were only dozens of them at best. In contrast, the Nine Shadows Fleet filled four ships with their crew.

The difference in power was too great. The overwhelming disparity in power was so great that it was not even a comparison.

“Damn it! Nine Shadows Fleet.”

“We might as well mark next year’s today as our memorial day.”

Even the martial artists of the Azure Maritime Company looked frightened. The notoriety of the Nine Shadows Fleet was that significant.

They left no survivors and plundered everything, taking away even their will to resist.

The captain ordered the crew to sail the ship at full speed.

All the sails were unfurled, and the ship moved at its highest speed with the wind. However, no matter how much they accelerated, the Nine Shadows Fleet was leisurely closing the distance.

The structure of the ships was too different.

The ships of the Azure Maritime Company were stable and suitable for long sea voyages, but the ships of the Nine Shadows Fleet were streamlined for fast movement.

If they traveled the same distance, the Nine Shadows Fleet would undoubtedly be faster.

The captain shook his head.

“It seems impossible to shake them off.”

“How long can we last?”

“At best, only half a day. They’ll probably catch up to us by then.”

Ahn Yu-san’s face twisted in despair at the captain’s answer. He looked at the trading company’s martial artists.

“Can we win if we fight them?”

“We’ll do our best, but…”

The leader of the martial artists, Do Sang-yeon, trailed off.

He too was a seasoned martial artist who had faced numerous life-or-death situations and had protected the Azure Maritime Company, but he could not guarantee the outcome this time.

“If we surrender and hand over our goods, can we save our lives?”

“I’ve never heard of the Nine Shadows Fleet leaving any survivors.”

“Maybe if it were one or two ships, we could try to fight, but against four, we stand no chance.”

“It seems today might be the last day for the Azure Maritime Company.”

Eventually, Ahn Yu-san hung his head in defeat.

No matter how much he thought, he couldn’t find a solution.

The only thing left to consider was asking for help from the Martial Sword Troupe, but it would take three more days to reach Haenam Island from here.

The captain spoke to Ahn Yu-san.

“Still, just in case, we’ll head towards Haenam Island. Sometimes, the Martial Sword Troupe patrols the coast.”

“We have no choice but to cling to that sliver of hope.”

Ahn Yu-san nodded his head.

He seemed to have aged ten years in an instant.

With a somber expression, Ahn Yu-san looked around the ship.

Everyone on board could be considered his family. His heart was filled with nothing but despair, knowing he could no longer protect his family.

His deep sigh echoed on the deck.

Ahn Yu-san’s despair spread across the entire ship like a plague.

“We’re going to die.”

“Shit! The kids aren’t even fully grown yet, what about my wife?”

A gloomy atmosphere enveloped the faces of the crew.

Such was the fear they felt towards the Nine Shadows Fleet.

Lee Gwak stood quietly at the bow, looking at the Nine Shadows Fleet.

The Nine Shadows Fleet was in no rush.

They were closing the distance with the Azure Maritime Company little by little. Even Lee Gwak, who knew little about ships, could guess that at this rate, they would eventually be caught by the Nine Shadows Fleet.

It was then.

“I’m sorry about this.”

Mok So-pung spoke to Lee Gwak with a look of exhaustion.

“What do you mean?”

“Here I was, bragging about giving you a ride, but it turns out I’ve put you in a coffin.”

“Is the Nine Shadows Fleet that terrifying?”

“You might not know, but to those of us who use the sea routes, they are no different from the grim reaper. They never leave any survivors. Shit! My poor wife.”

“Especially since I’m hardly home, If I get killed she’ll probably meet some other guy and start a new life. Heck, for all I know, some other guy might already be taking over my bedroom at home. Damn it!”

Mok So-pung shivered as if feeling a chill.

“Sopung! There’s no time to dawdle there. Quickly, grab the sail ropes. Something’s off about their movement.”

That’s when the captain called for Mok So-pung.

“Yes! On my way.”

Mok So-pung returned to his post after responding.

As the captain said, the atmosphere around the Nine Shadows Fleet was ominous. They suddenly increased their speed, drastically reducing the distance between the Azure Maritime Company’s ship and theirs.

The Azure Maritime Company’s ship struggled in vain to escape the Nine Shadows Fleet.

Now the distance had narrowed to the point where they could see the faces of those aboard the Nine Shadows Fleet.

The Nine Shadows Fleet consisted of four ships.

The lead ship was the largest and fastest. Dozens of martial artists were sitting on the deck of the lead ship, looking at them.

There was not a trace of tension on their faces; they were as relaxed as a leopard looking at a flock of sheep.

It was clear to them that the crew on the other ship were panicking.

No predator fears a frightened prey. The same was true of the Nine Shadows Fleet.

They had pirated countless times and killed an uncountable number of people. For them, pirating at sea was nothing special.

In their eyes, the Ship of Azure Maritime Company was like fattened lamb. All they cared about was how much riches they could find once they cut open the hulls and cut the boats.

To them, the Azure Maritime Company’s ship was no different from a sheep ripe for slaughter. All they cared about was how much riches they could find once they cut open the hulls and loot the ship.

As they neared the Azure Maritime Company’s ship, the man at the head of the Nine Shadows Fleet waved his hand, and the other three ships scattered and surrounded the Azure Maritime Company’s ship.

The captain screamed.

“Shit! Prepare for battle.”

The martial artists of the Azure Maritime Company drew their weapons, and the crew prepared for battle with harpoons and spears.

At that moment, the flagship of the Nine Shadows Fleet came close to the side of the Azure Maritime Company ship. Only then did the people of the Nine Shadows Fleet stand up.

Suddenly, the atmosphere on the flagship changed.

The previously loose and relaxed atmosphere disappeared, replaced by a chilling killing intent.

They were already accustomed to such plundering.

They knew when to conserve their strength and when to use it. Now was the time to exert their power.

A man in his late thirties aboard the flagship shouted.

“Stop the ship and throw away your weapons while you still can. Those who resist will be gruesomely killed and thrown to the fish. Heh!”

His voice thundered across the vast sea.

At that moment, the people on the Azure Maritime Company’s ship turned deathly pale. His voice was so powerful that it not only made their eardrums vibrate but also seemed to scramble their brains.

This was proof of his profound internal energy.

No one aboard the Azure Maritime Company’s ship possessed such a level of internal strength.

“It seems that man is the leader of the Nine Shadows Fleet.”

“What kind of internal energy is that…”

Do Sang-yeon and the other martial artists murmured among themselves, instinctively realizing the extraordinary level of the opponent’s internal energy.

Mad Shark Yu San-ok.

As people guessed, he was not the leader of the Nine Shadows Fleet but the deputy leader.

Yu San-ok always led the plundering, exerting ruthless violence and becoming a source of fear.

Yu San-ok prepared to jump onto the Azure Maritime Company ship with a large sword in his hand. Pirates from the other ships were also eyeing the Azure Maritime Company ship, weapons in hand.

The people aboard the Azure Maritime Company’s ship went pale.

No matter how much they braced themselves, the difference in power was too great. Yet, they couldn’t just sit there and be slaughtered, so they tried to suppress their fear.

Finally, the Nine Shadows fleet rammed into the side of the ship Lee Gwak and the others were on. As the ship rocked from the impact, the pirates of the Nine Shades Fleet jumped over.

“Slaughter them all and plunder everything!”

“Block them!”

“Don’t let a single one onto the ship.”

The Azure Maritime Company’s martial artists resisted desperately.

They swung their weapons, and the crew fought back with harpoons and other tools. Blood splattered on the deck, and the cries of people filled the air.

“How can this be?”

Ahn Yu-san’s eyes wavered.

The difference in power was too great. The people of the Azure Maritime Company were fighting desperately, but they were outmatched in both strength and numbers.

His precious people were falling one by one.

“Please, spare us!”

Their cries pierced Ahn Yu-san’s ears.

Ahn Yu-san tried his best to help them, but even his own life was in immediate danger.

Yu San-ok, the deputy leader of the Nine Shadows Fleet, sauntered over.

Like his nickname, the Mad Shark, he openly displayed his ferocious aura.

Ahn Yu-san trembled under Yu San-ok’s killing intent. Being an ordinary person, he couldn’t withstand the killing intent of someone skilled in martial arts.

“Are you the owner of this trading company?”

“Yes, that’s me.”

“Order them to stop resisting and hand over all the goods.”

“Will you spare us if I do?”

“Heh! I promise to kill you without pain.”

“How could…”

“If you continue to resist, I will torment you to death.”

Yu San-ok revealed his yellow teeth with a smile.

The nickname “Mad Shark” was not given without reason. Everyone he had killed had become shark food.

He had no intention of leaving a single survivor today.

Occasionally, one or two might jump into the sea and survive, but leaving no survivors was a long-standing rule of the Nine Shadows Fleet. This was why they had prospered for so long.

Fear breeds more fear, and those who become objects of fear dare not resist.

Yu San-ok was clever enough to use this fact to his advantage.

A martial artist from the Azure Maritime Company attempted a surprise attack on Yu San-ok. However, Yu San-ok easily dodged the attack and struck down the martial artist with his large sword..

Ahn Yu-san murmured as he saw the martial artist, with whom he had been friendly, sprawled on the ground with a huge wound in his chest.

Rage filled his eyes.

“I would rather die than hand over our goods to you.”

“Tsk! What a nuisance. Can’t be helped then.”

Yu San-ok raised his sword high into the air and swung it down with force towards Ahn Yu-san. Ahn Yu-san closed his eyes, waiting for death.

A stifled groan followed the sound of clashing metal.

Expecting pain but feeling none, Ahn Yu-san cautiously opened his eyes. To his surprise, someone was standing in front of him, blocking Yu San-ok’s path.

Ahn Yu-san blinked, not understanding the situation. But soon, he realized what had happened.

“Are you alright?”

The man blocking his path was Lee Gwak.

With Lee Gwak’s calm voice, Ahn Yu-san snapped back to reality. He then remembered that Lee Gwak was a martial artist.

Lee Gwak spoke again.

“Please step back.”

Despite Ahn Yu-san’s hesitation, Lee Gwak did not urge further and instead turned to face Yu San-ok.

Yu San-ok glared at Lee Gwak with eyes brimming with murderous intent.

“Who are you?”

“Aren’t you going to answer, you insolent fool?”

As Lee Gwak remained silent, Yu San-ok’s eyebrows shot up. However, Lee Gwak looked at him without any change in expression.

Normally, Yu San-ok would have attacked someone showing such disrespect. He had never tolerated anyone looking down on him.

But the reason Yu San-ok did not hastily attack was that Lee Gwak had deflected his sword with bare hands.

There wasn’t a single scratch on Lee Gwak’s hands that had deflected the steel blade. It was rare to find someone skilled enough to deflect a sword with bare hands, which was why Yu San-ok was being extremely cautious.

Lee Gwak then said to Yu San-ok.

“Take your men and leave the ship.”
