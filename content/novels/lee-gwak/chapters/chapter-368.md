“Finally, the boat is coming in.”

Seok Yi-cheon’s face lit up when he saw the boat approaching the dock.

It was an Unmado riverboat that could carry horses and cargo at the same time.

Having walked for several days, the mere thought of traveling comfortably by boat brought a great relief to Seok Yi-cheon.

It had been four days since they had left Taegang.

A thick layer of dust settled on their shoulders.

Thump!

Finally, the boat docked at the pier with a dull thud.

After the passengers who had been on board disembarked, Lee Gwak and his group boarded.

“Phew! Let’s rest now.”

Seok Yi-cheon plopped down on the deck, letting out a sigh of relief. Cheol Gwang-woo scolded him.

“Big brother, your stamina has always been a problem. What are you going to do if you get tired so easily?”

“Do you think I’m as mindlessly strong as you?”

Seok Yi-cheon snapped back, but Cheol Gwang-woo just chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. Frustrated by that response, Seok Yi-cheon let out a sigh.

He knew that arguing with him would only make him tired.

Whenever Seok Yi-cheon was exhausted, Cheol Gwang-woo would provoke him like this, and even though Seok Yi-cheon knew it was a trick, he couldn’t help but fall for it.

“Tch! You’re like a fox in a bear’s skin.”

“Hehe!”

Cheol Gwang-woo laughed and set down the large bundle he had been carrying on his back.

Inside the bundle were various tools and items that Bang Ye-in used. They were her most precious treasures. The fact that she had entrusted them to Cheol Gwang-woo spoke volumes about their relationship.

Cheol Gwang-woo looked at Bang Ye-in with warm eyes.

“Are you okay?”

“I’m fine.”

“Okay!”

Cheol Gwang-woo smiled at Bang Ye-in’s answer. His gaze then turned to Lee Gwak who was standing at the bow of the boat looking out at the river.

‘What is brother thinking about?’

Throughout the journey, Lee Gwak had hardly spoken. Ever since they decided to head to the Bang Clan’s Inn, he seemed to have become lost in thought. Cheol Gwang-woo and Bang Ye-in, sensing his mood, refrained from asking questions.

Lee Gwak’s decision to go to the Bang Clan’s Inn had been entirely at Bang Ye-in’s urging. As far as Bang Ye-in was concerned, it was for Lee Gwak’s sake—and indeed for the world’s—but to him, it must have felt like a heavy load. Sensing his concern, Bang Ye-in gently took Cheol Gwang-woo’s hand.

“He’ll be fine—he’s strong.”

Her words carried multiple meanings.

Lee Gwak wasn’t just physically strong. He wasn’t some naive youngster who knew nothing of the world. He had risen from the bottom, becoming strong through his own efforts. He knew how to care for those weaker than himself and never bowed to those stronger. He had climbed to his current position through sheer willpower.

His mental fortitude was even stronger than his martial arts. Bang Ye-in believed in Lee Gwak’s spirit and determination.

Just then,

“Get on the boat quickly.”

“Move the luggage onto the deck.”

Suddenly, the deck grew noisy. Bang Ye-in snapped out of her thoughts and saw a group of people boarding the boat.

Soon, the spacious deck was filled with their cargo.

Only after the last piece of cargo was on board did the group breathe a sigh of relief.

Lee Gwak’s eyes fell on a small triangular flag one of them was carrying. The triangular flag had the words “Jeon Gong Escort Agency” embroidered in bold red letters.

It was an escort agency he had never heard of before. But Lee Gwak didn’t pay much attention. There were dozens of well-known large escort agencies in the Jianghu, and if you counted the smaller ones, there were thousands.

It would be impossible to remember all of them.

Judging by the small number of escorts, it was clearly a minor agency.

“Whew! Glad we made it on time.”

Oh Jung-gyeong, the master of the Jeon Gong Escort Agency, breathed a sigh of relief.

Oh Jung-gyeong was a promising martial artist who had risen to become the head escort of a large agency. Three years ago, he grew disgusted by its corrupt ways.

Unable to endure the injustices, he left the agency and started his own. Using the salary he had earned from the previous agency and investments from acquaintances, he established the Jeon Gong Escort Agency and ambitiously began operations. But the world was not kind.

The merchants who promised to support his business after he started the agency often broke their promises. They would undercut him with unreasonable prices, causing him considerable losses. It was only with the help of really good people that he was able to keep the agency afloat. Without their help, the Jeon Gong Escort Agency would have collapsed and Oh Jung-gyeong would have been left penniless, wandering the streets of Jianghu.

“If this escort mission succeeds, I can breathe for a while.”

Oh Jung-gyeong muttered as he looked at the pile of luggage on the deck.

It had been commissioned by the most prominent person in the region where the Jeon Gong Escort Agency was located. If they could complete this mission safely, they would be able to secure a stable trade route.

Oh Jung-gyeong had staked the survival of the Jeon Gong Escort Agency on this mission.

His eyes scanned the deck for any possible threats.

“Hmm!”

His gaze fell on Lee Gwak’s group. Among the passengers on the boat, they stood out the most. At a glance, they were clearly not an ordinary group.

‘I should keep an eye on them.’

He couldn’t tell if they were a real threat, but it didn’t hurt to be cautious.

Oh Jung-gyeong cautiously approached Lee Gwak, who seemed to be the leader of the group.

When he got close, Lee Gwak looked up at him. Oh Jung-gyeong then spoke carefully.

“I hope I’m not disturbing you.”

“Not at all.”

“Since we’re on the same boat, why don’t we introduce ourselves? I’m Oh Jung-gyeong, the master of Jeon Gong Escort Agency.”

“I’m… Lee Jin-mun.”

“Nice to meet you, Brother Yi!”

“Likewise.”

Lee Gwak gave a slight smile. Oh Jung-gyeong didn’t seem to have any ill intentions.

“Are you on an escort mission?”

“Yes! An urgent matter has come up, and I’m on my way to Kaifeng.”

“I see.”

“May I ask where you’re headed, Brother?”

“I’m headed to Lu’An.”

“Lu’An? That’s in Anhui Province, right?”

“That’s right. As expected of someone who runs a courier agency—you’re good with geography.”

“Haha! Working in the escort business, I’ve been all over the place. I know most of the major locations. Lu’An is a beautiful place, especially along the outskirts, by the river, the plum blossoms are spectacular. In spring, they bloom in full, and their fragrance is simply enchanting. It’s nice to visit any time, but I’d recommend going in spring.”

“Thank you. I’ll make sure to visit in spring.”

The two continued to chat casually.

Lee Gwak and Oh Jung-gyeong were around the same age, so they got along well. However, neither revealed their deeper thoughts. Both had extensive experience in the martial world and knew how dangerous it was to reveal one’s true intentions upon first meeting. Nevertheless, Oh Jung-gyeong was convinced that Lee Gwak was not a threat.

It was because of Lee Gwak’s eyes.

At first glance, they seemed ordinary, but Oh Jung-gyeong had never seen anyone with clearer eyes than Lee Gwak. There was no selfishness or impure desire in his gaze.

Having met countless people while running the escort agency, Oh Jung-gyeong prided himself on his ability to read people.

Oh Jung-gyeong smiled and said,

“I should get back to my group. Let’s have a drink together if we have time later.”

“Sure!”

Oh Jung-gyeong returned to his escorts.

Lee Gwak watched him for a moment before approaching Seok Yi-cheon.

“That escort leader seemed quite anxious.”

“That’s right.”

Seok Yi-cheon, who had been through countless battles, was sharp. He had noticed why Oh Jung-gyeong had approached them.

Lee Gwak gave a small nod.

“These are uncertain times. It’s natural to be cautious. But he didn’t seem like a bad person.”

“Yeah, he seemed like a good guy.”

Seok Yi-cheon agreed with Lee Gwak’s assessment.

“Did you manage to rest a bit?”

“Yes, a bit of rest helped.”

“That’s good.”

“I’m still not at full strength, but once I’m healed, I can walk endlessly without trouble.”

Seok Yi-cheon was still recovering from his battlefield wounds and grew tired after only a little walking. He’d forced himself along this far, unwilling to become a burden on Igwak—and Igwak understood that well.

Just then, Cheol Gwang-woo and Bang Ye-in approached them.

Seok Yi-cheon glared at Cheol Gwang-woo.

“Where do you think you’re going, you big oaf?”

“Shall I go away, then?” Cheol Gwang-woo asked, casually shaking something in his hand. . Instantly, Seok Yi-cheon’s eyes followed the movement.

It was a bottle of alcohol.

“What’s that?”

“Big brother Dae-san told me to bring it for you to drink while resting.”

“Where do you think you’re going? Sit down here.”

Seok Yi-cheon tugged at his hand urgently, but Cheol Gwang-woo didn’t budge.

“You just told me to go, didn’t you?”

“Who said that nonsense? Not me.”

Seok Yi-cheon hastily shook his head.

Witnessing his almost pitiful appearance, Bang Ye-in couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

The liquor in Cheol Kwang-woo’s hand was specially brewed by Cheol Dae-san. Knowing how excellent Cheol Dae-san’s brew was, Seok Yi-cheon changed his attitude.

If it meant getting a taste of Cheol Kwang-woo’s liquor, he could endure being teased.

Saliva was already dripping from the corners of Seok Yi-cheon’s mouth.

Cheol Kwang-woo chuckled and set the bottle down on the floor.

“Then, I’ll let it slide this time.”

“Thank you!”

“Hehe!”

Cheol Kwang-woo filled Seok Yi-cheon’s cup to the brim.

Pleased by the fragrant aroma of the alcohol, Seok Yi-cheon smiled happily.

“Men really are…”

Despite shaking her head in disbelief, Bang Ye-in rummaged through her pack and pulled out some jerky.

“Have this with your drink.”

“Wow!”

Seok Yi-cheon exclaimed before even tasting it.

Even if it was just simple jerky, he knew that anything made by Bang Ye-in was incomparably superior to what others made.

After sipping the liquor, he chewed on the jerky.

“Ah! This is just like heaven.”

Seok Yi-cheon looked ecstatic.

Lee Gwak also smiled, lifting his glass.

The flavor lingering in his mouth was exceptional, just as expected from the alcohol specially prepared by Cheol Dae-san.

Sitting on the boat and sipping like this, it felt like there was nothing in the world to envy.

‘If only I could live like this…’

Lee Gwak’s smile was tinged with bitterness.

He knew all too well how difficult it was to fulfill such a simple dream.

It was a time of chaos.

The old order was collapsing, and a new one was emerging.

At its center was Lee Gwak.

Whether he liked it or not, people would not let him go.

If he truly wanted to retire in peace, he needed to end these troubled times as soon as possible.

That’s when Cheol Gwang-woo cautiously called out to Lee Gwak.

“Brother!”

“Hmm?”

“Why isn’t brother Woo-gyeong coming with us?”

“He has urgent matters to discuss with the Dragon Heaven Valley.”

“It seems he’s planning to join hands with them.”

“That’s likely.”

“It must have been a difficult decision.”

The Hao Clan traditionally advocated neutrality.

They collected and sold information without getting involved in the affairs of the martial world.

They feared taking sides could provoke the wrath of other martial factions.

Nam Woo-gyeong had always tried to adhere to these principles. However, the current martial landscape made it challenging to maintain such a balance.

For example, the Nine Dragons Clan had gone so far as to use Poison on Nam Woo-gyeong to take control of the Hao Clan, and other sects were also eyeing them.

In such circumstances, it was impossible to remain neutral indefinitely.

They needed to take a clear stance and come up with self-defense strategies.

In this regard, Dragon Heaven Valley could become a solid ally for the Hao Clan.

Everyone knew the Dragon Heaven Valley lacked an information network, and the Hao Clan lacked martial strength.

They could be mutually beneficial.

Lee Gwak had introduced Mook Seon-wol and Nam Woo-gyeong, and they immediately entered into negotiations.

That’s why Nam Woo-gyeong could not accompany Lee Gwak.

It was regrettable that Nam Woo-gyeong couldn’t come along, but it couldn’t be helped.

Lee Gwak lifted his cup.

“Me too!”

Bang Ye-in quickly raised her glass.

Cheol Gwang-woo and Seok Yi-cheon also raised their glasses to clink with Lee Gwak’s.

Chang!

The clear sound of the cups echoed across the deck.

A smile played on Lee Gwak’s lips.

Even though Nam Woo-gyeong wasn’t there, he didn’t feel lonely with the others around.

With them by his side, the journey to Lu’an didn’t seem too long.
