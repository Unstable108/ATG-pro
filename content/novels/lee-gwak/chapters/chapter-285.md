The Unmado River Boat arrived at the dock.

Lee Gwak boarded the riverboat with Lee Cheong and Cho Ryu-jin.

“Goodbye!”

As soon as Lee Cheong stepped onto the deck, he waved towards the dock.

At the dock stood Yoo Sa-hee and her husband, both waving back at him.

“Take care.”

“Stay safe. We’ll see you next time, Ryu-jin.”

They offered warm words not only to Lee Cheong but also to Cho Ryu-jin.

Cho Ryu-jin bowed deeply to show his gratitude. Although he kept his words to himself, the gratitude in his eyes was evident as he looked at them.

Yoo Sa-hee leaned her head on her husband’s shoulder.

Without saying a word, Lee Gwak made a fist-palm salute toward her. Yoo Sa-hee smiled and nodded slightly in response.

Even as the Unmado Riverboat departed, the two remained in the same posture. They only parted ways after the boat disappeared from sight.

The old man looked at Yoo Sa-hee and spoke.

“So many guests have come and gone, but this is the first time I’ve seen you so concerned. You must feel a strong attachment.”

“Yes, I can’t help but worry. If we had met a little earlier, we might have had a child like him.”

“Don’t talk nonsense. We’re happy as we are; why bother with children? Let’s just live happily together.”

The old man looked at Yoo Sa-hee as if she were saying something silly.

“I’m sorry.”

“For what now?”

“Because of me…”

“Enough! I don’t want to hear it. Hmph!”

The old man waved his hand dismissively and turned away.

Yoo Sa-hee watched his back with a slight look of pity.

If not for her, he might have married an ordinary woman and had children of his own.

Would he be happier now if that had happened? This thought made her feel all the more sorry.

Just then, the old man suddenly reached out his hand to her.

“What are you waiting for? Hold my hand already.”

“Yes!”

The warmth she felt from his hand blew away all her guilt.

Hand in hand, the two walked side by side towards the inn.

It was then.

Thud-thud-thud!

Suddenly, two men on horseback appeared.

They had swords at their waists, clearly indicating they were martial artists.

At their appearance, the old man stiffened slightly. Being an ordinary person, the arrival of martial artists was unwelcome.

At that moment, Yoo Sa-hee gently squeezed his hand signaling him not to worry.

Only then did relief appear on the old man’s face.

The woman he lived with had once been a figure who ruled the Jianghu with fear. With her by his side, he had no reason to fear them.

Relieved, the old man spoke to her.

“I’ll go inside first.”

“Don’t worry, go on in.”

“Alright!”

The old man strode into the inn.

After watching his back for a moment, Yoo Sa-hee turned her attention to the martial artists.

By then, the group of martial artists had already arrived in the inn’s courtyard.

They were the Ghost Sword Squad martial artists who had been tracking Lee Gwak.

Without even dismounting, they asked Yoo Sa-hee, “Old woman! Have you seen any suspicious people?”

“Suspicious people?”

“Yes! We’re looking for a group consisting of an adult and two boys.”

Surprisingly, they had found out that Cho Ryu-jin was traveling with Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong to this place.

Although they didn’t know Lee Gwak’s true identity, they had learned from witnesses that Cho Ryu-jin was traveling with a wealthy man.

Yoo Sa-hee asked, “Why are you looking for them?”

“Mind your own business and answer the question, old woman! If you’re hiding something, we won’t go easy on you.”

A sinister aura emanated from the Ghost Sword Squad martial artists.

They had come all the way here tracking Cho Ryu-jin without proper rest. As a result, they were exhausted and highly irritable.

They were an advanced party. Following the traces they left, Dan Li-yeon and Ok Mu-yeon were leading the entire Ghost Sword Squad after them.

If they failed to find Cho Ryu-jin, the main force would have wasted their time. This had to be avoided at all costs.

Yoo Sa-hee pointed upstream with her finger.

“They boarded a boat and went upstream.”

“Are you certain?”

“Why would an old woman like me lie? It’s certain.”

“Damn! They already took the Unmado Riverboat? Did they mention their destination?”

“How would I know that? I’m just telling you what I saw.”

Yoo Sa-hee lied calmly.

It was true that Lee Gwak had boarded the Unma Do Riverboat, but he was heading downstream, not upstream. But the Ghost Sword Squad martial artists who had just arrived at the port had no way of knowing that.

They hurriedly drove their horses upstream.

Watching them recede into the distance, Yoo Sa-hee muttered to herself.

“That should buy them some time.”

She calmly entered the inn.

The journey on the Unma Do Riverboat was smooth.

Although the boat rocked greatly in places where the current was rapid, it was not particularly dangerous.

Even while traveling by boat, Lee Cheong did not neglect his martial arts training. Lee Gwak used the boat to have Lee Cheong practice balancing.

The violently rocking deck was the perfect training ground.

Lee Cheong assumed a horse stance on the swaying deck and practiced the Eight Techniques. Maintaining balance wouldn’t have been easy, but he managed to endure.

It was proof that all his training hadn’t been in vain.

Lee Gwak watched his son’s growth with a pleased expression.

At that moment, he noticed Cho Ryu-jin watching Lee Cheong with envious eyes.

If the Cho Family Manor had not collapsed, Cho Ryu-jin would have received such training from his father. But now, Cho Ryu-jin will never have that opportunity again.

The Cho Family Manor had burned down, and his father was no longer in this world.

Lee Gwak knew that Cho Ryu-jin was watching with envy, but he couldn’t teach him martial arts.

Teaching one’s secret techniques was something passed only to direct disciples or blood relatives, and Lee Gwak was no exception.

Moreover, Lee Gwak’s martial arts deviated from the norms of the Jianghu, so unless one learned thoroughly from the basics, one was likely to suffer from qi deviation.

Thus, he allowed Lee Cheong to continue his training and approached Cho Ryu-jin.

“Uncle!”

“How are you feeling?”

“I’m fine now.”

“That’s a relief.”

“It’s all thanks to you, Uncle. I’ll repay this kindness once we reach the Hwang Family Manor.”

“You don’t need to think of it as a favor, and there’s no need to repay it. Just take care of yourself.”

“I was taught to always repay kindness and to repay enmity many times over. A martial artist of the Cho family never forgets either kindness or enmity.”

Cho Ryu-jin raised his head proudly.

The Cho Family Manor had collapsed, but the spirit of the Cho family had not crumbled.

Cho Ryu-jin was the last heir to carry on the spirit of Cho Family Manor, and until his death, Cho Family Manor was not completely destroyed.

The killing intent that had once filled his face had now subsided a lot. However, the sharp glint in his eyes remained.

After watching Cho Ryu-jin for a moment, Lee Gwak suddenly reached into his robe. When his hand reappeared, he was holding a small wooden box.

It was the box containing the White Spirit Divine Pill.

“Take it.”

“This is?”

“Something I came across by chance. If you take it, it will help you.”

“Un… Uncle?”

“Hurry and take it. My arm is getting tired.”

“I’ve already received so much. I can’t accept anything more. Perhaps it would be better for Cheong to have it.”

Cho Ryu-jin shook his head.

The scent emanating from the box was rich and fragrant, signaling it was a rare medicine.

Though tempted, he didn’t want to accept it so easily out of pride.

Lee Gwak forced the box into Cho Ryu-jin’s hand.

“This medicine isn’t suited for Cheong. It’ll be more beneficial for you.”

“Thank you… then I’ll accept it with gratitude.”

“Good.”

Lee Gwak smiled, gently patted Cho Ryu-jin’s head.

Cho Ryu-jin held the box tightly to his chest.

His shoulders trembled slightly. He thought he had no tears left, but his eyes grew moist once more.

Afraid that Lee Gwak would see, Cho Ryu-jin quickly wiped his tears and ran into the cabin.

“I will definitely repay this kindness.”

The Unma Do Riverboat moved leisurely along the flowing river. Having passed all the rapids, its speed had slowed, but the rocking of the boat had significantly decreased.

Thanks to that, Lee Gwak and his group could rest comfortably.

Boom!

At last, the Unma Do Riverboat arrived at the port of Yangzhou. As the massive hull touched the dock, a gangplank was lowered, and people busily disembarked.

Lee Gwak waited for the rush to die down, then disembarked with the children.

On the dock stood a man holding the reins of Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong’s horses.

Lee Gwak gave him a tip and took over the horses.

Though they had arrived in Yangzhou, there was little time to spare. To get from Yangzhou to Lake Hong, they had to choose between river or land routes. Taking another boat would not fit their schedule, and the land route would take more time.

Lee Gwak chose the land route over the river route. He judged that going by land would save time compared to waiting for another boat.

As soon as they set foot on land, vitality returned to Cho Ryu-jin’s face.

He had spent his childhood in Hwang Family Manor and was familiar with the terrain. The familiarity of the terrain made him feel a little better.

Cho Ryu-jin said to Lee Gwak, “From here on, I’ll guide the way.”

“Alright! Please do.”

Lee Gwak readily agreed.

Cho Ryu-jin switched places with Lee Cheong and sat at the front of the horse.

“Hold on tight! I’m going to run as fast as I can.”

“Okay, hyung.”

As Lee Cheong grabbed Cho Ryujin’s waist, he nodded.

“Hiyah!”

With a spirited shout, Cho Ryu-jin lightly kicked the horse’s side. The horse shot forward like an arrow.

Lee Gwak spurred his horse to follow behind Cho Ryu-jin.

Cho Ryu-jin drove the horse at a terrifying speed. Knowing the terrain well, he could push the horse to its limits.

The horse, having felt cooped up on the boat, responded to Cho Ryu-jin’s urge, galloping at full speed.

The wind rushed past them with needle-like intensity. But Cho Ryu-jin didn’t slow down.

The wild ride continued for nearly half a day, until the horses’ mouths frothed and Lee Cheong’s body began to ache from the bouncing.

Finally, Cho Ryu-jin slowed his pace, allowing the horse to catch its breath. Lee Gwak was a bit behind, unable to keep up with Cho Ryu-jin’s relentless pace.

Cho Ryu-jin looked back at Lee Cheong sitting behind him.

“Thank you!”

“For what?”

“For letting me ride your horse. Thanks to you, I feel much better.”

“That’s good.”

“You’re really generous. That’s why I like you.”

“Hyung!”

“I’ll try to become such a person when we meet again later.”

As Cho Ryu-jin gave a warm smile to Lee Cheong, it happened.

Thud!

Suddenly, there was a small explosion from Cho Ryu-jin’s head.

Cho Ryu-jin’s pupils shook.

Suddenly, his consciousness began to fade in and out.

“Hyung?”

Lee Cheong’s eyes widened.

An arrow had pierced through Cho Ryu-jin’s temple, protruding from the other side. But Cho Ryu-jin didn’t even seem to notice.

“Th…ank…”

Cho Ryu-jin’s lips twitched.

“To… ngue…?”

Lee Cheong reached out to Cho Ryu-jin.

In that instant, Cho Ryu-jin’s body collapsed, falling off the horse.

“Brother!”

Lee Cheong shouted and jumped off his horse. He quickly rushed to catch Cho Ryu-jin, but by the time he held him, Cho Ryu-jin’s breath had already ceased.

“This can’t be… How can this be…?”

Lee Cheong sobbed, holding Cho Ryu-jin in his arms.

Hiss!

At that moment, another arrow flew.

The target was Lee Cheong’s head, still holding Cho Ryu-jin. But this time, the arrow did not meet its mark.

Lee Gwak suddenly appeared and blocked Lee Cheong’s path. The arrow that was flying towards Lee Cheong was split in two by Lee Gwak’s blade and fell to the ground.

Lee Gwak’s face hardened as he looked at the unexpected death of Cho Ryu-jin. He had never anticipated an ambush here. He had noticed the signs of an ambush, but there had been too much distance between him and Cho Ryu-jin to prevent it.

Then, a group appeared in Lee Gwak’s line of sight.

The moment he saw them, Lee Gwak’s eyes narrowed with rage.

They were the Ghost Sword Squad, the very ones who had been chasing Cho Ryu-jin. At the head of the group was one of the martial artists, holding a bow. This was the man who had fired the arrow at Cho Ryu-jin and Lee Cheong.

His name was Jo Jinwi, a master archer renowned in the Ghost Sword Squad.

Jo Jinwi was often entrusted with the opening strikes in battles. His role was to shoot enemies from a distance, breaking their spirits with his precise marksmanship. This was one of the battle tactics of the Ghost Sword Squad.

“You missed one.”

Jo Jinwi clicked his tongue in disappointment.

Beside him, Ok Mu-yeon sneered.

“You’re getting rusty.”

“It’s not my fault. We’ve been chasing around aimlessly after being tricked by lies. How could I have any strength left to pull the bowstring?”

Jo Jinwi offered an excuse.

The faces of the Ghost Squad martial artists were filled with killing intent.

They had been deceived by Yoo Sa-hee’s lies and spent a whole day chasing the wrong trail. Only later did they realize that there were no boats heading upstream. They had to rush on horseback non-stop, arriving here exhausted.

Because of that, the team members who had originally pursued them had received severe punishment from Ok Mu-yeon.

And so, in frustration, Jo Jinwi had taken matters into his own hands and shot the arrow that killed Cho Ryu-jin.

He was venting his anger at the source of their misfortune.

“This time, I’ll do it right…”

Jo Jinwi drew another arrow, preparing to take a more accurate shot.

He intended to finish the job he had missed earlier.

But then, it happened.

Thud!

With a dull sound, Jo Jinwi suddenly staggered backward.

“What?!”

Piercing Leaf Technique.

Ok Mu-yeon muttered, recognizing the technique.

As the name suggested, it was the method of throwing leaves to kill the enemy. However, even for a master, the power of Piercing Leaf Technique could only be effective within a dozen or so paces.

The thin leaves, which were as fragile as paper, could carry internal energy, but that energy dissipated over distance. Beyond a certain range, it was almost impossible for them to inflict harm on a person.

The distance between the Ghost Sword Squad and Lee Gwak was still over twenty paces. Yet, despite this considerable gap, the technique had managed to fatally strike the master archer, Jo Jinwi.

It was then that Ok Mu-yeon realized that the prey they had been chasing was no ordinary target.

Ok Mu-yeon shouted.

“Who are you?”

Ssss!

Lee Gwak responded.
