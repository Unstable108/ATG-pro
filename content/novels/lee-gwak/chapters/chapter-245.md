Her entire body was drenched in sweat, her clothes torn here and there, revealing pale skin and fresh scratches. Yet, Bang Ye-in had no leisure to fix her attire as she had to keep moving.

The whole incident started from her act of kindness.

While enjoying a bath in the Hua Qing Chi hot springs, she brought a lunchbox from the inn to eat.

Enjoying good food and making it was her only pleasure. She liked food prepared by others, but it was even better to eat what she had made.

So there she was, soaking in the hot spring, eating the lunch box she had packed. As she had made it with the excitement of a picnic, the lunch box was particularly elaborate and tasty.

With the relaxation of the hot spring and the added delight of a delicious meal, it felt like she was in paradise.

A girl was watching Bang Ye-in enjoying her fairy-like leisure. She seemed to be around Bang Ye-in’s age, a beautiful girl with exceptionally sharp eyes.

The girl asked Bang Ye-in if she could have some of Bang Ye-in’s lunchbox, and Bang Ye-in gladly shared the remaining food with her.

The girl was shocked after tasting Bang Ye-in’s lunchbox .

The lunchbox Bang Ye-in had prepared had the effect of boosting a person’s internal energy, and the girl noticed it.

She asked Bang Ye-in to join her and cook for her, but Bang Ye-in naturally refused. This led the girl to attack Bang Ye-in.

At that time, Bang Ye-in was not very worried. She was confident in her martial arts skills.

Indeed, she gained the upper hand against the girl and was eventually able to subdue her. The problem was that the girl had a master.

A decrepit and hideous old woman.

The old woman persistently pursued Bang Ye-in.

After a direct confrontation, Bang Ye-in regretted her recklessness.

The old woman was no ordinary expert.

She was Spirit Granny, one of the Eight Great Martial Artists of Jianghu.

The girl who fought with Bang Ye-in was Spirit Granny’s disciple, Yeom So-so. Bang Ye-in had seen her once in Siege Fortress.

But time had passed, and Yeom So-so had matured, so she hadn’t recognized her at first.

Realizing too late that the girl was Yeom So-so, the situation had already spiraled out of control.

Though Bang Ye-in was strong among young martial artists, she was no match for the Eight Great Martial Artists who had dominated the Jianghu for so long.

Spirit Granny, notorious for her unrestrained ways and immense martial prowess, feared nothing except the Supreme Master of the Ten Sects.

Spirit Granny thought that if she had Bang Ye-in by her side preparing food, she could easily enhance her internal energy.

She might be too old to achieve significant improvements, but her disciple, Yeom So-so, could gain tremendous internal energy.

That’s why Spirit Granny attacked Bang Ye-in.

Luckily, Bang Ye-in managed to escape from Spirit Granny’s clutches. However, Spirit Granny persistently pursued her.

“If this keeps up, I’ll be caught by that old monster before long.”

She thought she had shaken them off, but she felt a cold killing intent and hostility. It was proof that Spirit Granny was still doggedly pursuing her.

Bang Ye-in regretted giving the lunchbox to Yeom So-so. She had offered it out of kindness, but now, blinded by greed, they were pursuing her with malice.

“Given the situation, escaping to Immortal Cloud Valley is the only option. I hope my sister is there…”

After entering Yeosan, she had been steadily gathering information about the Divine Doctor. As a result, before stopping at Hua Qing Chi, she was able to obtain a crucial clue.

An old hunter, active mainly around Yeshan, had been severely injured by a giant boar, but a fairy appeared and healed him.

The old hunter showed the wounds he had received from the boar to people at the inn, and Bang Ye-in was also present.

When Bang Ye-in asked the old hunter where he met the fairy, he said it was Immortal CLoud Valley, located in the deepest part of Yeoshan. She had been planning to visit the Immortal Cloud Valley soon, but then this disaster struck.

As Bang Ye-in raced towards Immortal Cloud Valley with all her might, a sharp sound pierced the air.

Suddenly, a sharp sound of cutting air echoed.

Almost instinctively, Bang Ye-in twisted her body to the side.

In an instant, a fist-sized rock whizzed past her and collided with a rock ahead, boring a large hole into it. It was something that defied common sense. However, there were beings in the world who defied common sense, and Spirit Granny was one of them.

Cold sweat trickled down Bang Ye-in’s back.

If Spirit Granny had truly aimed that rock at her, Bang Ye-in would have been unable to dodge it. Spirit Granny had adjusted her internal energy just enough for Bang Ye-in to be able to react.

It was like a fox playing with a mouse.

“Hehe! So, this is where you’ve run to?”

A chilling voice echoed from afar. The crow-like voice belonged to none other than Spirit Granny.

Next to Spirit Granny stood a girl with fierce eyes. It was her disciple, Yeom So-so.

“Kekeke! Master, Look at her running for her life. So arrogant before, and now look how pathetic she is.”

Yeom So-so burst into harsh laughter.

Looking at Bang Ye-in’s retreating figure, her eyes were filled with a cruel intent.

She had kindly offered Bang Ye-in to join her, but Bang Ye-in didn’t even hesitate to refuse.

Yeom So-so was not used to being refused by anyone, especially not when she had made an offer from her heart, her fury was sky-high.

“I won’t be satisfied until I make that bitch my servant, Master.”

“I’ll break her legs so she can’t go anywhere, and then I’ll do just that.”

Their conversation, carried by the wind, reached Bang Ye-in’s ears clearly. They had deliberately amplified their voices with internal energy.

Bang Ye-in shuddered, feeling a chill run down her spine. She knew they wanted to provoke this kind of reaction from her, but she couldn’t help feeling scared.

Bang Ye-in gathered all her remaining energy to enhance her speed. Even though she sped up, Spirit Granny and her disciple were gradually closing the gap.

Bang Ye-in clenched her teeth.

Spirit Granny and Yeom So-so were underestimating her. They were content with just cornering her into desperation, without delivering a decisive attack.

They were waiting for Bang Ye-in to become exhausted and surrender on her own. However, Bang Ye-in had no intention of giving up under any circumstances.

She was a chef as well as a martial artist.

Since her childhood, she had been taught never to give up first in any situation, and she adopted this as her life’s principle.

Bang Ye-in leaped over rocks and branches, moving at a terrifying speed. Even though she couldn’t shake off Spirit Granny and Yeom So-so, she was gradually getting closer to Immortal Cloud Valley.

Spirit Granny’s eyes narrowed.

Normally, those being pursued lose their composure and panic. However, Bang Ye-in was moving straight ahead without a hint of wavering.

It meant she had a clear destination or plan in mind.

‘Perhaps it’s time to stop playing with her.’

Even a rat will bite a cat when cornered.

Especially since the opponent was a martial artist, and not just any martial artist, but a young one with an extraordinary background.

It wouldn’t be surprising if she had some trump cards up her sleeve.

Spirit Granny let out a strange cry and launched herself forward.

She flew towards Bang Ye-in with terrifying speed, like a beam of light.

Spirit Granny closed the distance in an instant and swung her palm towards Bang Ye-in’s back.

Bang Ye-in screamed as she tumbled to the ground.

She was hit in the back, and blood flowed from her nose and mouth, evidence of severe internal injuries.

Bang Ye-in couldn’t easily stand up and gasped for breath.

The pain was so intense she couldn’t even scream. She just trembled, clenching her fists.

Spirit Granny reached out and grabbed Bang Ye-in by her hair.

“If you thought you could escape from this old lady’s grasp, you were sadly mistaken. I have never lost a prey I’ve set my sights on. Hehe!”

At that moment, Bang Ye-in gathered all her strength and delivered a powerful palm strike to Spirit Granny’s chest.

Bang Ye-in knew from the start that she had no chance in a direct confrontation. From the moment she allowed Spirit Granny to land a blow, she endured the pain and waited for an opportunity to launch a surprise attack.

However, Spirit Granny seemed to have anticipated Bang Ye-in’s attack, dodging it effortlessly and instead grabbing her wrist.

Spirit Granny looked at Bang Ye-in, who wore a look of despair, and laughed grotesquely.

“Hehe! Looks like we need to start by taming that temper of yours.”

She mercilessly broke Bang Ye-in’s wrist.

Bang Ye-in let out a harrowing scream.

Spirit Granny looked satisfied as she watched Bang Ye-in roll on the ground in agony. In the meantime, Yeom So-so arrived.

“Hmph! Serves her right. That’s what she gets for not listening when spoken to nicely.”

“Her eyes are still filled with defiance, so stay back.”

“Isn’t that dangerous, Master?”

“If I break both her legs, what threat would she be? You don’t need to worry about anything; just watch what your master does.”

Spirit Granny, after watching her disciple with a moment of pleasure, raised her palm high, aiming for Bang Ye-in’s legs.

Her words were not an empty threat. She genuinely planned to break Bang Ye-in’s legs and then take her with her.

She was aware that Bang Ye-in was from the Bang Family Inn. Considering the influence of the Bang Family Inn, it was risky to mess with Bang Ye-in carelessly. Normally, it would be risky to harm someone with such ties, but they had already crossed the point of no return.

Bang Ye-in was alone, and this place was far beyond the reach of the Bang Family Inn’s influence. There was no way for the inn to find out what happened to Bang Ye-in here.

After breaking her legs and using her to enhance her disciple’s internal energy, they planned to dispose of her quietly.

Spirit Granny struck down with her palm towards Bang Ye-in’s legs.

‘My carelessness has led to this disaster.’

Bang Ye-in regretted her carelessness as she clenched her eyes shut.

A loud explosion sounded, and Bang Ye-in’s frail body jerked violently. The fierce wind pressure distorted her face slightly, but she felt no pain.

Slowly, Bang Ye-in opened her eyes. Then, she saw someone blocking her view, standing in front of her.

Spirit Granny’s palm strike was stopped by his blade, hanging in the air.

He asked without looking back. The moment Bang Ye-in heard his voice, she felt a wave of relief wash over her. It was a voice she recognized.

Bang Ye-in let out a sigh of relief unknowingly.

The person who had stopped Spirit Granny was Lee Gwak.

How Lee Gwak knew of her peril and arrived to help her was unknown, but just his presence was comforting.

Contrary to Bang Ye-in’s relief, Spirit Granny’s eyes were filled with a terrifying killing intent.

“Who are you? Daring to interfere with this old deity’s affairs, you must be itching for death.”

“It’s been a long time, Spirit Granny.”

“I saw you long ago in Siege Fortress.”

“Siege Fortress? That would be six years ago.”

Spirit Granny tilted her head, puzzled.

Lee Gwak did not linger in her memory from their encounter in Seige Fortress. At that time, he was merely an outer hall squad leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance, a position far beneath her notice. Spirit Granny did not bother to remember those she considered unworthy of her attention. To her, Lee Gwak was just one of many faces she had encountered. However, Lee Gwak had never forgotten her.

Spirit Granny was the person who inflicted a fatal wound on his master, Gwang Noh-ya, ultimately leading to his death.

Although Gwang Noh-ya himself had accepted his death with no grudge, his disciple, Lee Gwak, could not remain indifferent.

The moment he saw Spirit Granny, his blood boiled with suppressed rage. Yet, contrary to his emotions, his mind was colder and more calculating than ever.

Now was not the time to confront Spirit Granny.

It was time to find the divine physician urgently.

“How dare you tell me to step back?”

“Master, this man is clearly mocking you.”

Yeom So-so glared at Lee Gwak with her eyes narrowed.

Even after all these years, Yeom So-so remained malicious and deceptive. Despite her innocent and beautiful appearance, she was like a venomous snake coiled inside.

At that moment, Cheol Gwang-woo appeared, carrying the children in each arm.

Seeing Bang Ye-in’s broken wrist, Cheol Gwang-woo’s eyes widened in shock.

“Did this old monster do this to you?”

A suffocating aura of killing intent emanated from Cheol Gwang-woo. Just seeing Bang Ye-in injured was enough to trigger his killing intent and madness.

Bang Ye-in tried to suppress her pain as she spoke, but her distorted expression betrayed her true condition.

Cheol Gwang-woo set down the children and glared at Spirit Granny.

“Hmph! How dare a bear of a man spread his killing intent to me?”

Spirit Granny snorted with disdain.

As one of the Eight Great Martial Artists, she was not intimidated by Cheol Gwang-woo.

She didn’t even consider Cheol Gwang-woo a threat. However, Lee Gwak was a different matter.

Although she hadn’t exerted her full power, the fact that her significant strike was blocked indicated that he possessed considerable internal energy.

Her palm throbbed from the impact, indicating the substantial shock she received, which only fueled her anger further.

“You dare obstruct me? I’ll tear off your head and feed it to the dogs.”

Her palm unleashed a tremendous force.

The force swept towards Lee Gwak like a tidal wave.

At that moment, a beam of blade light cut through the wave.
