The next day, news spread that delegations from Dragon Heaven Valley and Sky High Castle had arrived in Sipyeon.

Already, four of the Seven Sects had entered Sipyeon.

The people were thrilled by the news.

Although it wasn’t known who Dragon Heaven Valley and Sky High Castle had sent, it was certain they were masters rarely seen in the Jianghu.

The opportunity to witness the top masters of the Jianghu gathered in one place was incredibly rare. It was a once-in-a-lifetime chance for many, which only fueled their excitement.

And now, everyone was curious to see which sect would send their delegation next.

The atmosphere in Sipyeon grew increasingly heated.

Even Lee Gwak, walking alone through the streets, could sense the growing excitement.

He stopped in the middle of the street and looked around.

The voices of passersby filled his ears.

“The prestige of the Wudang Sect truly hasn’t faded. So many people have come to celebrate them.”

“Well, Wudang was one of the pillars of the Nine Great Sects alongside Shaolin. This level of celebration is only fitting.”

“But this still isn’t enough. The Jade Heaven Alliance should also send their delegation to truly restore their dignity.”

“The Jade Heaven Alliance… Do they even have the face to show up? The Jianghu is in this state because of them.”

“Still, wouldn’t they send someone? The Wudang Sect hasn’t openly opposed them yet.”

People gathered in small groups, engaging in heated debates.

Some insisted the Jade Heaven Alliance would come, while others argued that they wouldn’t.

Jade Heaven Alliance!

Lee Gwak furrowed his brows.

Just thinking about them made his head throb.

If they sent their delegation here, it was impossible to predict what might happen.

“Sigh.”

Lee Gwak shook his head, dispelling his thoughts.

Nothing had happened yet.

There was no point in agonizing over something that hadn’t occurred. For now, he needed to clear his mind and focus on the present.

Lee Gwak continued walking.

He was heading to where the Dragon Heaven Valley’s delegation was staying. Fortunately, he had a friendly relationship with them and was going to pay his respects.

Fortunately, finding their lodgings wasn’t difficult.

Upper World Manor.

It was a large manor built on a hill overlooking a lake. The Dragon Heaven Valley had rented out the entire manor.

Their wealth permitted such extravagance—something unthinkable for most sects.

Dragon Heaven Valley’s martial artists stood guard at the main gate of Upper World Manor.

When they spotted a stranger approaching from afar, their expressions became alert.

“State your identity!”

“If you do not stop—”

They suddenly trailed off and stared at Lee Gwak.

Recognition flashed on their faces.

“Master Lee Gwak!”

“Wait, isn’t that Master Gwak?”

They had recognized him.

Lee Gwak was the benefactor of Dragon Heaven Valley.

There wasn’t a single person in the Dragon Heaven Valley who didn’t recognize him.

They sheathed their weapons and greeted him with beaming smiles.

“Welcome, Hero Lee Gwak!”

“We’ve been waiting for your visit!”

They greeted him warmly.

“It’s been a while. I hope you’ve been well?”

“Thanks to you, we’ve been doing well. Are you here to see Lady Mok?”

“Is Miss Mok here as well?”

“Yes! Only someone of her rank can represent our sect appropriately.”

“Is she inside now?”

“She’s meeting a guest, but if you wait inside, you’ll be able to see her soon.”

“So she has a visitor.”

“Yes. The guest arrived half an hour ago and hasn’t left yet. It seems they’re deep in conversation. Please, come in. I’ll escort you.”

“I can find my way.”

“I’d be honored to guide you. If not for you, I’d never have seen my family again.”

The middle-aged martial artist’s name was Gu Yeon-sang.

He had been present during the Martial Sword Troupe’s betrayal of Dragon Heaven Valley.

Had Lee Gwak not arrived in time, he would have surely died. Since that day, Gu Yeon-sang considered Lee Gwak his benefactor.

“This way, please.”

Gu Yeon-sang personally led Lee Gwak to Muk Seonwol’s quarters, which overlooked the most beautiful garden in the manor.

Lee Gwak couldn’t help but admire the breathtaking scenery.

“This place is truly beautiful. How did you find it?”

“We were lucky. The owner was acquainted with one of our elders. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have been able to stay here.”

“That’s fortunate.”

“Here we are. If you wait here, you’ll soon be able to meet Lady Mok.”

Gu Yeon-sang left Lee Gwak waiting in a small pavilion near the garden, then rushed off to inform Mok Seon Wol of his arrival.

Left alone, Lee Gwak sat and looked around.

It was clear the owner had poured immense effort into maintaining the manor. The buildings were arranged in harmony, and rare flowers and plants bloomed vibrantly, showcasing their beauty.

Such harmony couldn’t have been achieved in just a year or two.

The sunlight was warm, and the scenery was breathtaking.

A smile naturally formed on Lee Gwak’s lips.

Just then—

From the direction Gu Yeon-sang had gone, a young monk in gray robes appeared.

Lee Gwak knew instinctively that this monk was the guest visiting Mok Seon Wol.

The monk walked straight toward him.

As he came closer, his features became clear.

He looked to be in his early twenties, with a kind and innocent face. His large, gentle eyes were enough to put one at ease.

But from the moment he appeared, Lee Gwak didn’t let down his guard.

Because the monk was failing to fully suppress a powerful, overwhelming energy.

It could be due to incomplete training, or he might be doing it deliberately.

Lee Gwak believed it was the former.

The monk didn’t seem to be doing it on purpose.

As he approached, the young monk paused and looked at Lee Gwak. A flicker of surprise crossed his face before he settled into a composed bow.

“Amitabha. I was lost in thought and didn’t realize a guest was present. I am Yonghwa.”

“I’m Lee Gwak, Master Monk!”

“Please, don’t call me Master. Just Yonghwa is fine, Master Lee.”

“Yonghwa, are you from Shaolin by any chance?”

“What makes you say that?”

“Just a feeling.”

“You’re impressive. Yes, I am from Shaolin.”

“Hmm…”

Lee Gwak let out a soft sound.

When Wudang announced that it would reopen its gates, he had wondered if Shaolin might do the same.

But to actually meet a monk from Shaolin—it was unexpected.

“Is Shaolin opening its gates as well?”

“No. I only left the temple for a special task. Shaolin has no plans to open its gates for now.”

“Even though Wudang has?”

“Each sect has its own circumstances. Our head abbot believes the time has not yet come.”

“I see.”

Lee Gwak nodded.

Yonghwa didn’t seem to be lying.

At least, there was no reason to lie here and now.

Yonghwa’s eyes sparkled as he looked at Lee Gwak.

“To think I’d meet you here, Master Lee Gwak. What brings you here?”

“I’ve had ties with the Dragon Heaven Valley for some time. I heard they were here, so I came to pay my respects.”

“I see.”

“And what brings you here, Yonghwa?”

“Given the long history between Wudang and Shaolin, I couldn’t ignore it. I came here to observe.”

“Hmm.”

“I’ve been hoping for a chance to meet you, Hero Lee Gwak, and I’m truly delighted that our paths have crossed like this”

“I’m honored to meet a revered monk from Shaolin.”

“Amitabha. If it’s not too much trouble… may I visit you again later?”

“Of course.”

Lee Gwak replied without hesitation, and a gentle smile formed on Yonghwa’s lips.

So the rumors were true. Most people become arrogant once they reach his level—but not him. There isn’t a trace of arrogance in him. It’s rare for someone’s reputation to align so perfectly with their true character

Since entering the Jianghu, Yonghwa had heard countless rumors about Lee Gwak.

In the current Jianghu, dominated by the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Seven Sects, Lee Gwak stood alone as a figure of undeniable presence.

His fame resounded throughout the Jianghu.

Naturally, Yonghwa had assumed he would be arrogant. But not a single negative rumor existed about him.

He’d thought the stories were overblown, but the Lee Gwak he met in person was exactly as the rumors described.

Such cases were exceedingly rare. And it left him somewhat bewildered.

At the same time, he was growing fond of Lee Gwak.

He wanted to be friends with him.

It wasn’t often that you met someone who was so genuine, both inside and out. Everyone would want to be friends with such a person.

Yonghwa gave Lee Gwak a polite bow.

“I must be taking up too much of your time. I’ll come visit you another day.”

“I’ll be looking forward to your visit.”

“Amitabha! Thank you. Then, I shall take my leave…”

Yonghwa said goodbye and left the Upper World Manor.

Lee Gwak watched him disappear for a moment, then turned and headed toward Mok Seon-wol’s quarters.

“Welcome, Master Lee Gwak!”

Mok Seon-wol greeted him with a bright smile.

In the few months they’d been apart, she had matured noticeably.

Her appearance was now firm and composed – fitting for the leader of a sect.

In truth, Mok Seon-wol had achieved remarkable progress in recent months.

Her father, Mok Jin-myeong, who had partially overcome his heart demon, had imparted his knowledge to her.

As a result, her martial arts skills had improved dramatically.

“It’s been a while, Lady Mok.”

“It truly has. I heard the news—you’ve established your own sect?”

“Yes.”

“It’s still too small to be called a proper sect.”

“Everything starts humbly. But a small seed, if it survives, grows into a mighty tree. I believe your sect will become just that.”

“Thank you. Your words mean a lot.”

Mok Seon-wol’s gaze was calm as she looked at Igwak.

Over the past few months, Mok Seon-wol had completely let go of her feelings for him. The inner turmoil that had started because of her father’s words had now been cleared.

Because of that, she could now face him with a calmer mind and gaze.

“Did you also receive an invitation from the Wudang Sect?”

“Taoist Jinghae brought the invitation personally. I couldn’t refuse.”

“He came to you directly?”

“Yes.”

“Hmm…”

Muk Seon-wol let out a quiet hum.

“Is something wrong?”

“Well… I heard he also visited Shaolin.”

“Really?”

“Yes. He urged Shaolin to reopen its gates and join forces with Wudang.”

“And what was Shaolin’s response?”

“They said they have no intention of reopening for now.”

“Hmm.”

“Instead, they sent Monk Yonghwa to observe what the Wudang Sect was planning.”

“So that’s why he came to see you?”

“Yes. He’s been diligently gathering information by traveling around the area. Visiting our sect was his last stop.”

“……”

“Hero Lee Gwak!”

“Please, speak.”

“Be careful. Something doesn’t feel right. Among the factions that have entered Sipyeon, only a few are friendly toward you. The rest are either openly hostile or have clashed with you at some point.”

“……”

“For some reason, Wudang seems to be targeting you.”

Muk Seon-wol’s eyes shone sharply.

She was really worried about Lee Gwak. And her concern was not lost on him.

Following Nam Woo-gyeong, Muk Seon-wol had also warned him to be wary of Wudang.

Both were individuals with exceptional insight and intuition. For them both to warn him like this—it couldn’t be a coincidence.

Lee Gwak looked up at the massive mountain rising behind Mok Seon-wol.

Mount Wudang.

The legendary peak, shrouded in centuries of mystery, seemed to glare down at Lee Gwak with hostility.
