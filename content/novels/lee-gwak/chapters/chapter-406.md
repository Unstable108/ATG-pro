Excluding the Lord of the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Seven Sects. Jang Hwak, the Five Yin Demon Hand, was considered one of the strongest among the Eight Great Martial Artists,

Though some of the Eight Great Martial Artists had already met their end, he remained alive and well.

His nature was cruel and self-centered, and he was particularly harsh toward others. As a result, even among the Eight Great Martial Artists, many feared him deeply.

Jang Hwak’s gaze toward Jang Musan was cold.

The contempt in his eyes made Jang Musan tremble.

Even though winter had passed, an unbearable chill seeped into his bones.

Jang Musan’s shoulders trembled slightly.

Though he had lived his entire life as Jang Hwak’s son, he could never get used to that look.

As a member of the Eight Great Martial Artists, Jang Hwak’s pride soared to the heavens. Naturally, he expected his son to be the same. But Jang Musan’s talent was nowhere near as exceptional as his father’s.

Jang Hwak was disappointed in his son’s talent, which fell short of his expectations. That didn’t mean Jang Musan was completely untalented, he just didn’t meet Jang Hwak’s high standards.

From then on, Jang Musan lived under his father’s scornful gaze.

The words he hated the most were being called “useless” by Jang Hwak.

Jang Musan kept his head lowered, staring at the ground.

Jang Hwak looked at him and said,

“Was the task I gave you that difficult? All I asked was to secure a room.”

“F-Father!”

“Useless fool! Just who did you take after…”

Jang Musan’s lips trembled.

Even Oh Jung-gyeong, who was watching, felt pity for him.

Jang Hwak no longer spared him a glance. Instead, he turned his eyes to Oh Jung-gyeong.

Though useless and incompetent, Jang Musan was still his blood. And he could not forgive the man who had defeated his son.

“Ugh!”

Under Jang Hwak’s oppressive glare, Oh Joong-gyeong let out a pained groan.

It felt as though thousands of needles were stabbing his chest simultaneously. Overwhelmed by the agony, he clutched his chest, struggling to breathe.

Jang Hwak was a martial artist on an entirely different level compared to Jang Moo-san—far beyond what Oh Joong-kyung could handle.

“Kgh!”

Oh Joong-gyeong face turned deathly pale as he groaned.

It felt as though thousands of needles were stabbing his chest simultaneously. The intense pain made it hard for him to breathe, and he clutched his chest in agony.

Jang Hwak was a master on a completely different level. Someone like Oh Jung-gyeong had no chance of enduring his presence.

“Argh!”

Oh Jung-gyeong’s face turned pale with pain.

He tried to gather his internal energy to resist Jang Hwak’s aura. But the more he tried, the heavier the pressure became.

The invisible force crushed his chest, making it impossible to breathe.

Just then—

“That’s enough,”

A calm voice cut through the tension.

“Huff…! Huff…!”

In an instant, the pressure on Oh Joong-gyeong vanished as if it had never existed.

He collapsed to the ground, gasping for air. In that short time, his entire body had been drenched in sweat.

Jang Hwak no longer looked at him.

His cold eyes were now locked onto the man who had stepped forward, as if he will devour him.

“I didn’t expect to find a master here. Who are you?”

“Lee Gwak.”

“Lee Gwak?”

A glint appeared in Jang Hwak’s eyes.

Though he was a man who feared nothing in the world, he always kept tabs on martial artists who could pose a threat to him.

‘So this is the one they call the Sura Blade?’

Lee Gwak was precisely such a martial artist.

He was a rising star who had surpassed even the Eight Great Martial Artists, threatening the leaders of the Seven Sects themselves.

Jeung Wi Hyeon, the Spirit Granny one of the Eight Great Martial Artists, along with countless other renowned martial artists, had fallen before Lee Gwak like autumn leaves in the wind.

Individually, none of those defeated by Lee Gwak were inferior to Jang Hwak.

Jang Hwak felt every nerve in his body tense up. His instincts were screaming at him to stay alert.

‘So the rumors were true.’

Honestly, when he first heard the rumors about Lee Gwak, he hadn’t believed them.

In his mind, it was inconceivable that someone so young could rival the leaders of the Seven Sects or the Eight Great Martial Artists.

But now, seeing Lee Gwak in person, he understood.

The rumors were completely true.

Lee Gwak was the first martial artist in decades to make him feel this level of tension.

Jang Hwak asked,

“What is your relationship with that man?”

“He’s my friend.”

“Friend? What an odd pairing. Friends should be of equal standing.”

Jang Hwak glanced again at Oh Jung-gyeong.

Oh Jung-gyeong’s lips trembled.

He already knew better than anyone that he and Lee Gwak were mismatched in status. But hearing it from someone else felt like a dagger twisting in his chest.

Then—

“And what about you, sir? What is your relationship with this foolish man? You hardly seem to be on equal footing.”

Lee Gwak’s sour words echoed through the air.

Jang Hwak’s face immediately darkened.

“I am Jang Hwak. That useless man is my son.”

“Oh, so you’re the Five Yin Demon Hand, Master Jang.”

“You know me?”

“How could I not know one of the Eight Great Martial Artists? As a junior, I greet you with respect.”

“Enough. I have no interest in insincere pleasantries.”

“Is that so?”

“What happened here? Why is my son rolling on the ground?”

“Wouldn’t it be quicker to ask your son directly?”

Jang Hwak’s eyebrow twitched at Lee Gwak’s answer.

Had it been anyone else, he would have cleaved their head in two on the spot. But since it was Lee Gwak, he held back.

Lee Gwak was a martial artist worthy of standing toe-to-toe with him.

Jang Hwak did not like to fight powerful enemies without preparation.

He turned to Jang Musan.

“What happened?”

“Well, that is…”

“Did you pick a fight first?”

“Yes.”

“Idiot!”

“…”

“If you’re going to start a fight, you should at least finish it properly! You rushed in without knowing your opponent’s strength and got defeated? Can you still call yourself my son?”

“I’m sorry…”

Jang Musan lowered his head deeply.

Even Oh Jung-gyeong, who had fought him, felt sorry. Jang Musan’s self-respect had been crushed into the dirt.

His blank eyes and the drool dripping from his slightly open mouth were proof enough.

Jang Hwak spoke to Lee Gwak,

“I’ll be taking my son.”

“Shouldn’t an apology come first?”

“An apology?”

“Your son mocked and attacked my friend simply because he needed a room. Shouldn’t he at least apologize for that?”

“Are you picking a fight with me?”

“I’m just stating the truth.”

Jang Hwak’s face hardened at Lee Gwak’s calm reply.

A subtle red hue appeared around his eyes.

It was killing intent. But Lee Gwak didn’t even flinch.

Gulp

The onlookers swallowed hard in the tense atmosphere.

Both Lee Gwak and Jang Hwak were among the strongest martial artists in the world.

A clash between such powerful figures, whose one move could alter the fate of the Jianghu, had everyone tense.

“…”

They stared at each other in silence.

The pressure was suffocating.

Then—a man quietly stepped between them.

It was Oh Jung-gyeong.

He bowed to Jang Hwak and said,

“Your son need not apologize. I, too, lost my temper, so I share some responsibility.”

Jang Hwak’s eyebrow twitched at the unexpected words.

But they gave him a way out.

Now he could take his son without apologizing, and Lee Gwak couldn’t demand one either.

Jang Hwak was reluctant to clash with Lee Gwak.

Victory would be sweet, but if he lost, he would forfeit the reputation and everything he had painstakingly built over the years.

The risks far outweighed the rewards. And Oh Jung-gyeong had just stepped in to settle it for him—he ought to have been grateful.

But he still felt uneasy.

It was because of the stark contrast between Oh Jung-gyeong’s generosity and his son’s disgrace.

He was already disappointed in his son’s failure, and now he was even more disappointed.

Jang Hwak looked at Jang Musan and said,

“What are you doing? Let’s go.”

“Y-Yes!”

Jang Musan scrambled to his feet.

Watching his stumbling figure, Oh Joong-gyeong muttered,

“They say everyone has their own story, but I never thought I’d feel sorry for that guy.”

“You had it rough.”

Lee Gwak lightly patted Oh Joong-gyeong’s shoulder.

Only then did Oh Joong-gyeong turned to Lee Gwak and ask,

“My neck’s still attached, right?”

“Perfectly fine.”

“Phew!”

He let out a deep sigh of relief.

It had been a nightmare of a moment.

If he hadn’t defeated Jang Musan, or if Lee Gwak hadn’t stepped in to stop Jang Hwak’s rage, the Jeonggong Escort Agency would’ve been wiped out that day.

He was struck again by how incredible Lee Gwak was.

Jang Hwak, one of the Eight Great Martial Artists, had backed down because of him. That spoke volumes about Lee Gwak’s presence.

Oh Jung-gyeong muttered without thinking,

“Thanks!”

“For what?”

“For helping…”

“We’re friends. No need for thanks. Now let’s go in. I’m starving—I haven’t eaten properly.”

“Haha! Got it. I’ll tell them to bring out the best food we’ve got.”

Oh Jung-gyeong laughed heartily.

Lee Gwak was about to follow when he suddenly paused.

An unexpected figure was staring intently at him.

It was the woman who had accompanied Jang Musan.

Though Jang Hwak and Jang Musan had left, she had stayed behind, silently watching Lee Gwak.

“Do you still have business?”

“My name is Ga Yeon-bing.”

“Excuse me?”

“My name. If I had known you were the Sura Blade, I would have greeted you properly sooner. What a shame.”

“…”

“I only happened to meet Master Jang and travel with him. So, I hope you won’t judge me based on him. Well then…”

Ga Yeon-bing bowed gracefully before leaving.

Lee Gwak watched her retreating figure for a moment.

Her slender, pale fingers stood out vividly in his mind.

Soon, she disappeared from sight.

After that Lee Gwak entered the inn. Inside, the owner was clearing the broken table while the chef had already begun preparing new dishes.

The moment Lee Gwak stepped in, the owner rushed over.

“Welcome, Hero Lee! I had no idea someone as esteemed as you was staying at our humble inn.”

The owner’s sparkling eyes were almost overwhelming.

And it wasn’t just the innkeeper. The eyes of the guests inside the inn, and even those peeking through the windows from outside, were filled with admiration.

Oh Jung-gyeong approached him.

“It must feel overwhelming. But what can you do? That’s the fate of a celebrity.”

“Sigh…”

“Enough sighing—have a drink instead. The innkeeper said he’ll bring out his finest liquor, something he’s been saving. Thanks to you, I get to enjoy a little luxury today.”

A satisfied smile had already formed on Oh Jung-gyeong’s lips.

The mention of the innkeeper’s best liquor had piqued his interest.

Lee Gwak didn’t scold him.

He could see how parched Oh Jung-gyeong’s lips were.

Though he was putting on a calm front, there was no doubt that Oh Jung-gyeong had been the most nervous person in the room.

Standing between Lee Gwak and Jang Hwak had taken a lot of courage.

In that brief moment, Oh Jung-gyeong had agonized over how to mediate the situation without bringing harm to his Trading Company.

In a way, it had been a life-or-death gamble—his entire body was still drenched in sweat.

His hands trembled slightly; the tension had not completely dissipated.

Lee Gwak nodded and walked over to the freshly set table.

“Drinking sounds good. Our destination isn’t far now, so let’s drink our fill today.”

“I’ll cover the bill.”

“I won’t refuse.”

Thud.

Lee Gwak and Oh Jung-gyeong took their seats.

Lee Gwak’s gaze fell on the shattered window.

It had been broken during the fight between Jang Musan and Oh Jung-gyeong, leaving a clear view of the outside.

Beyond the broken window, a massive silhouette loomed.

In the darkness, barely visible, was Mount Wudang.

Even from distant Dengzhou, the imposing aura of Wudang Mountain could be felt, like a finely forged sword piercing the sky.

‘Wudang.’

The Wudang Sect was now right before them.

Perhaps news of Lee Gwak’s arrival in Dengzhou had already reached them.

Lee Gwak quietly sipped his drink, his eyes fixed on the shadowed silhouette of Mount Wudang
