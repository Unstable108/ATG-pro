The inner and outer court gates of the Nine Dragons Clan were firmly shut.

The elite members of the Nine Dragons Clan were stationed at the main entrances to both the inner and outer courts, and a covert search for Nam Woog-yeong had begun.

Because the martial arts tournament was still underway, they could not conduct an open search. Instead, the martial artists of the Nine Dragons Clan scattered naturally throughout the area to find Nam Woog-yeong.

They quietly tailed anyone suspicious and kept a persistent watch on those who were not visible near the tournament grounds.

At first, the spectators watching the martial arts tournament were unaware of these developments. However, martial artists are far sharper than ordinary people.

“What’s going on?”

“It looks like they’re searching for something.”

They sensed that something unusual had occurred inside the Nine Dragons Clan. But the problem was that they could not determine what it was.

The Human-rank martial arts tournament was reaching its climax. Since it involved young talents, there was no major issue so far. But if this kind of behavior continued into the Earth-rank or Heaven-rank tournaments, it would certainly dampen the atmosphere, as if pouring cold water over it.

That was presumably why the Nine Dragons Clan had mobilized its elite in secret, as it was a task that couldn’t be openly addressed.

However, despite their searches, they could not find Nam Woo-gyeong. He had disappeared without a trace.

“It seems he has already escaped the fortress. I apologize.”

Eun Mu-yeong knelt before Gyeong Un-cheon.

They had sealed off both the inner and outer courts and conducted a thorough search, but Nam Woo-gyeong was nowhere to be found. Therefore, Eun Mu-yeong believed that Nam Woo-gyeong had already escaped from the Nine Dragons Clan.

Seated in his Dragon Throne, Gyeong Un-cheon looked at Eun Mu-yeong with cold eyes.

“What about the ‘Enemy’?”

“We have not identified him yet.”

“…….”

“I am sorry, Master!”

Eun Mu-yeong banged his head against the floor to apologize.

His forehead split open on the hard blue stone, and blood splattered in all directions. But he barely felt the pain.

Such pain was inconsequential to him at the moment.

“I am disappointed, Mu-yeong.”

“My apologies. Please give me another chance, Master!”

“Another chance? After making such a mess of things, you dare ask for more?”

“I am so sorry. I never thought that the Hao clan would move so quickly to rescue Nam Woo-gyeong.

Eun Mu-yeong believed the Hao Clan had rescued Nam Woog-yeong.

He couldn’t think of any other person or sect that could do such a thing.

Gyeong Un-cheon’s gaze grew colder.

“How do you intend to handle this? Not only have you failed to gain control of the Hao Clan, but you’re about to turn them into our enemy.

“I will apologize to them myself.”

“Apologize? Do you think Nam Woo-gyeong will forgive someone who tried to use poison on him?”

“I will pay a sufficient price.”

“What kind of price?”

“Thirty thousand nyang of gold and several of our sect’s secret manuals.”

“Ha! You mean you’d rip out the very pillars of our main sect? Fine, let’s say you did offer them. Would Nam Woog-yeong accept?”

“He will accept. He’s someone armed with cold logic. He values pragmatism over pride. The Hao Clan always lacks funds, so he’ll surely accept my offer.”

Eun Mu-yeong gritted his teeth.

In truth, he was not convinced Nam Woo-gyeong would accept. Even though Nam Woo-gyeong prioritized practicality over pride, it seemed nearly impossible that he would swallow such humiliation.

But he had to try something. If he could not resolve this situation, it would not just mean making an enemy of the Hao Clan, but also losing his master’s trust.

The latter was what he feared most.

He may be able to mend his relationship with Nam Woog-yeong later, but if he loses Gyeong Un-cheon’s trust even once, he could be removed from his hard-earned position as the young master of the sect.

He had to prevent that at all costs.

Gyeong Un-cheon’s icy gaze pierced Eun Mu-yeong’s heart like a dagger.

“Fine! You take care of this problem yourself. Whether you kidnap Nam Woo-gyeong again or kneel down and beg for forgiveness, do as you see fit. But if this incident adversely affects our sect, you will face corresponding disadvantages.”

“Leave it to me, Master!”

Thud!

Eun Mu-yeong banged his head against the floor once more.

Gyeong Un-cheon’s lips twisted into a sneer.

“Make sure the martial arts tournament isn’t affected. Handle it discreetly. Understood?”

“Of course, Master.”

“Leave now.”

“Yes!”

With Gyeong Un-cheon’s gesture, Eun Mu-yeong bowed again and left the hall.

Left alone, Gyeong Un-cheon stood up from his Dragon seat and muttered to himself.

“Who are you?”

While Eun Mu-yeong suspected the Hao Clan of rescuing Nam Woo-gyeong, Gyeong Un-cheon thought differently.

He had examined the martial artists guarding the northern side of the medicine hall.

“To leave no external trace and only injure their heart meridians, just enough to knock them unconscious….”

The delicate control of internal energy required for that feat surpassed his expectations.

Gyeong Un-cheon himself had no difficulty striking someone’s heart meridian to subdue them. But to do it so precisely that the victim would just lose consciousness was not easy.

“At least a master on the level of the Eight Great Martial Artists would be needed.”

His gaze sharpened.

Coincidentally, one of the Eight Great Martial Artists was currently inside the Nine Dragons Clan.

Gyeong Un-cheon’s suspicion turned toward her.

＊ ＊ ＊

Go Il-yeong walked among the people around the platform, his brow furrowed.

“What the hell happened here? The Hao Sect’s rumored leader?”

He was none other than the lord of Cloud Dragon Hall, Go Il-yeong.

Even he had not been told by Eun Mu-yeong why Nam Woo-gyeong needed to be captured. He had simply been ordered to do so.

Although he disliked Eun Mu-yeong’s secretiveness, he had faithfully carried out the command.

At that moment, his eyes fell upon a man watching the tournament with deep interest.

The man had his fists clenched as he watched the platform. He was none other than Lee Gwak.

On the stage, a boy who looked around ten years old was facing off against another boy who appeared three or four years older.

This boy was Lee Cheong.

This was the last match of the day. Surprisingly, Lee Cheong had made it into the final eight.

Lee Cheong’s last opponent was Nam Jin-woon, the nephew of the lord of the Unsan Escort Agency.

If Lee Cheong won again today, he would advance to the finals taking place three days later.

Go Il-yeong tapped Lee Gwak’s shoulder and said:

“Lucky you.”

“Pardon?”

“If he wins again, he’ll advance to the finals, right?”

“Ah, yes! Indeed.”

“When Lee Cheong makes it to the finals, you should treat me to a drink. I know a place with some great liquor.”

Go Il-yeong joked jovially. Yet despite his seemingly envious tone, his eyes were sharp as a hawk’s.

Eun Mu-yeong had ordered him to root out anyone who might have taken Nam Woo-gyeong.

But from the looks of Lee Gwak—cheering on his son from below—he didn’t seem like a suspect.

Lee Gwak smiled and responded:

“Understood. If Lee Cheong reaches the finals, I’ll buy the drinks.”

“Haha! Don’t forget that promise.”

“Of course not.”

“Well, I have some business to attend to, so I’ll be off.”

“Business?”

“Just something I need to do.”

Go Il-yeong waved off Lee Gwak’s question and moved away.

Lee Gwak watched Go Il-yeong’s retreating figure with disinterest, then turned his gaze back to the stage.

Nam Jin-woon glared at Lee Cheong and opened his mouth.

“You really made it up here, kid!”

His gaze carried a killing intent.

He had never really believed that Lee Cheong would reach this point.

Lee Cheong looked up at Nam Jin-woon.

If Nam Jin-woon hadn’t provoked him, Lee Cheong would never have come this far. In that sense, Lee Cheong was grateful to him.

Because of Nam Jin-woon’s taunt, he discovered the joy of wielding martial arts. He now had a flame burning in his heart.

Lee Cheong offered Nam Jin-woon a respectful bow.

“Lee Cheong of the Mad Martial Sect humbly requests a lesson from the Young Master of the Unsan Escort Agency”.

“Hmph!”

Nam Jin-woon responded to Lee Cheong’s polite request with a sneer.

It was a clear sign that he was looking down on Lee Cheong. But Lee Cheong was neither upset nor angry.

He just looked at Nam Jin-woon with eyes as clear as a calm lake. This calm behaviour only made Nam Jin-woon more angry.

“How insolent!”

Nam Jin-woon assumed his fighting stance.

His martial art was the Mad Tiger Thunder Light Fist from Bokho Martial Hall.

The Mad Tiger Thunder Light Fist was one of the top three techniques at Bokho Martial Hall.

Despite his twisted personality, Nam Jin-woon’s martial talent was considerable. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been taught the Mad Tiger Thunder Light Fist by the master of Bokho Martial Hall.

He had won all his matches using the Mad Tiger Thunder Light Fist.

No other prodigy had matched up to him so far, so his confidence was at its peak.

Lee Cheong took a deep breath and aimed his wooden sword at Nam Jin-woon.

‘Keep the heart hot, the head cool…’

Recalling Lee Gwak’s advice, Lee Cheong calmed himself completely.

As he stared at Nam Jin-woon with half-open eyes, he exuded the aura of a master.

Nam Jin-woon’s eyebrows twitched. He was provoked by Lee Cheong’s aura.

“I’ll crush you.”

Nam Jin-woon charged at Lee Cheong.

The strikes of his Mad Tiger Thunder Light Fist swirled around Lee Cheong like a storm. His assault was as fierce as a wild tiger on the rampage.

Thud thud thud!

A series of crashing sounds echoed out, pushing Lee Cheong’s tiny body backwards. Several people had pitiful expressions on their faces.

They were Lee Cheong’s supporters.

The sight of a tiny child defeating an opponent much bigger than him and winning a series of matches had touched their hearts. That’s why they had been cheering for him for some time now.

“Seems like he’s completely outmatched. Is this the end?”

“He did well enough to get this far. Even if he doesn’t make it to the finals, he still put up a good fight. I bet even Lord Gyeong (the sect master) of the Nine Dragons Clan will take note of him.”

The crowd assumed Lee Cheong would lose.

Nam Jin-woon’s onslaught was that fierce, and Lee Cheong seemed to be helplessly on the defensive. To their eyes, Lee Cheong was merely hanging on without counter attacking.

But there was one person, Lee Gwak, who thought differently.

He did not think Lee Cheong was in danger. Lee Cheong was faithfully employing the subtleties of Cloud Stride Art to evade Nam Jin-woon’s attacks.

Overpowered in both strength and momentum, Lee Cheong was stalling for time, waiting for Nam Jin-woon to tire. Although it looked dangerous now, if the match dragged on, Lee Cheong had a chance.

Sweat flew in all directions; his face was flushed red.

His ragged breaths echoed in Lee Gwak’s mind.

Lee Cheong seemed completely immersed in the match.

The Cloud Stride Art and the Eight Sects Sword Art were harmonizing perfectly.

‘Cheong-ah!’

Lee Cheong seemed to be genuinely enjoying himself.

All Lee Gwak had wanted from Lee Cheong was to buy time to save Nam Woo-gyeong.

Actually, it would help Lee Gwak if Lee Cheong lost now and did not advance to the finals. However, seeing Lee Cheong truly enjoying the match made such thoughts vanish from his mind.

Lee Cheong switched from defense to offense.

Thud thud thud!

“Haaap!”

Their wooden blade and fist collided, followed by a sharp cry.

Lee Cheong’s small body moved swiftly like a leopard.

His talent was finally blooming.

‘Yes! Go for it until the end.’

Lee Gwak cheered for Lee Cheong.

Lee Cheong was completely engaged in the fight.

As time passed, his Eight Sects Sword Art became even more refined.

“This kid!”

Nam Jin-woon’s face twisted like a demon’s.

His fists hurt every time they clashed with Lee Cheong’s wooden sword. His skin peeled and blood splattered. He had thought his fists were as solid as iron, yet they were battered by a mere wooden sword wielded by a kid.

Nam Jin-woon couldn’t accept that he was being so thoroughly defeated by a mere kid.

His rage boiled over, and his eyes rolled back.

“I’ll kill you.”

Nam Jin-woon unleashed the ultimate move of Mad Tiger Thunder Light Fist, the Fierce Tiger Slaying Dragon.

Even the master of the Bokho Martial Hall had sternly warned him never to use this move indiscriminately, especially against the innocent.

In fact, Nam Jin-woon had never used the Fierce Tiger Slaying Dragon move throughout the entire tournament. But anger blinded him and stripped away his reason.

Roar!

A strike of unprecedented power from the Mad Tiger Thunder Light Fist surged towards Lee Cheong.

“What’s that?”

“Dangerous!”

The seasoned martial artists who recognized Nam Jin-woon ’s lethal intent shouted out in concern. To their eyes, it looked as if Lee Cheong’s frail body would be torn apart at any moment.

That’s when something unexpected happened.

Lee Cheong’s body spun once in place, then using that momentum, he thrust his blade forward.

Ssshiaaak!

Lee Cheong’s blade shot out like a fearsome dragon.

It was the fourth form of the Eight Sects Sword Art, Blood Dragon’s Roar.

Blood Dragon’s Roar collided head-on with the Mad Tiger Thunder Light Fist of Nam Jin-woon.

Kwaaang!

“Grrk!”

With a deafening roar, a scream rang out simultaneously.

The one who flew through the air and fell below the platform was none other than Nam Jin-woon.

“Uwaaaah!”

“Amazing!”

The gathered crowd burst into cheers at the unbelievable result.

Anyone could see that Lee Cheong had been at a disadvantage and that Nam Jin-woon held the upper hand. It was only natural that they were shocked when the outcome was overturned.

Nam Jin-woon lay with his eyes rolled back, foam gathering at the corners of his mouth.

One of the Nine Dragons Clan’s senior figures watched his pitiful state and muttered to himself,

“He was someone we were considering bringing into the Nine Dragons Clan, and I kept an eye on him, but he’s just this much?”

There was a glint of contempt in his eyes as he looked at Nam Jin-woon. After being marked in this way, there was no chance Nam Jin-woon would be assigned a good master within the Nine Dragons Clan.

“It’s best just to send him somewhere appropriate and not bother.”

With that single defeat, Nam Jin-woon’s future prospects were decided.

Lee Cheong, his face flushed, looked around in surprise at what he had accomplished.

“The winner is Lee Cheong of the Mad Martial Sect!”

A martial artist from the Nine Dragons Clan declared Lee Cheong’s victory. However, his voice didn’t register in Lee Cheong’s ears.

As he looked down at the crowd below the platform, his eyes suddenly went wide.

There was a face he had been longing to see.

“Father!”

Lee Cheong jumped down from the platform and threw himself into Lee Gwak’s arms. Lee Gwak hugged him and said,

“Well done.”

“Heh heh!”

More than the thunderous cheers of the crowd, that single phrase of praise from Lee Gwak made Lee Cheong happier than anything else.
