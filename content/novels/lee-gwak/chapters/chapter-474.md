Gu Mun-hye stared silently at Go Geom-wol.

He sat motionless with his eyes closed, like a statue.

Though it was only a brief moment, to Gu Mun-hye, it felt like an eternity.

Finally, Go Geom-wol opened his eyes, having sorted through his thoughts.

His gaze was as calm as ever, but for some reason, Gu Mun-hye felt an inexplicable chill run down her spine.

Go Geom-wol spoke.

“What happened to Elder Yang’s remains?”

“The warriors of the main sect retrieved and cremated him with full rites.”

“Good! He devoted his life to the sect—it’s only right to honor him properly.”

Go Geom-wol nodded slowly.

Gu Mun-hye bowed her head in apology.

“I’m sorry.”

“For what?”

“For destroying the Endless Prison on my own. I was afraid of that man at the time.”

“You were afraid of Lee Gwak?”

“I think I was just overwhelmed by his presence. So, I lured him into the sealed chamber where the former sect leader had been held and collapsed the prison. I truly didn’t expect him to survive… or that he would end up killing Elder Yang.”

“How did Elder Yang end up confronting Lee Gwak?”

“Actually…”

Gu Mun-hye explained how Jeon Ma-ok and the Red Flame Squad had massacred innocent villagers. Two entire villages had been burned and wiped out.

Hearing this, Go Geom-wol only said one thing:

“They deserved to die.”

“…”

“If Lee Gwak hadn’t killed them, I would have.”

Though he spoke in a flat tone, it was terrifying.

He wasn’t even addressing her, but Gu Mun-hye felt true fear.

“So in the end, the Red Flame Squad brought Lee Gwak and Elder Yang together.”

“I’m sorry. I had no idea they were venting their anger like that.”

“How could that possibly be your fault? Don’t blame yourself.”

“Still…”

“It was just fate.”

First Jin Gwang-hon, now Elder Yang—both had been entangled with Lee Gwak and lost their lives.

Even if Go Geom-wol had personally subdued and imprisoned Jin Gwang-hon, the fact remained that he had once been his master.

Lee Gwak had killed Go Geom-wol’s master, and now Elder Yang too.

A blood-soaked bond had formed between them that could never be erased.

This wasn’t something that would be resolved by simply avoiding one another.

Until one of them died, the grudge would remain.

“So it’s come to this…”

“What do you intend to do? Should we send the Blood Demons to the Mad Martial Sect? With him gone, we could easily destroy it.”

“That would only benefit the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

Go Geom-wol was cold and rational.

He suppressed the rage boiling in his heart and analyzed the situation with clarity.

“Right now, we must focus on destroying the Jade Heaven Alliance. Mad Martial Sect comes after.”

“You’re saying Jade Heaven Alliance comes first?”

“Exactly!”

For a moment, Gu Mun-hye felt goosebumps rise all over her body.

It was a situation where anyone would understand if Go Geom-wol exploded in anger.

No one could blame him—not even her.

But instead, he suppressed his emotions and made sacrifices to ensure victory in the war.

Gu Mun-hye knew she could never do the same.

‘You alone are the true leader of the Celestial Demon Troupe.’

Go Geom-wol, who had endured all humiliation for the sake of the sect and even imprisoned his own master, Jin Gwang-hon. And now, he was setting aside his emotions once again, staking everything to win this war.

How could she not respect, admire, and follow such a man?

Gu Mun-hye silently vowed to dedicate the rest of her life to Go Geom-wol.

Go Geom-wol pressed his lips together and stared into the distance.

‘Soon, we will meet again, Lee Gwak!’

The journey with the Iron Order Escort Agency was smooth.

Their large group size discouraged troublemakers, and even forest bandits didn’t dare attack them.

As a result, Lee Gwak’s group could rest and travel comfortably in the carriages. And thanks to the young driver skillful handling, they could focus entirely on cultivation.

By the time they neared Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, the group was nearly fully recovered.

After learning Lee Gwak’s identity, Ji Sang-il, the agency’s leader, treated him with utmost respect. Lee Gwak repeatedly told him not to stand on ceremony, but it was no use.

In the distance, Taiyuan came into view.

They had almost reached the escort agency’s final stop.

A long line of people waited outside the city gates. As the capital of Shanxi Province, Taiyuan was always crowded, but even accounting for that, the number of people gathered was unusually large.

Ji Sang-il asked one of his escorts,

“What’s going on?”

“I’ll go find out.”

One of the escort guards rode ahead, then returned quickly with a report.

“They’re refugees.”

“Refugees?”

“Yes, people who’ve lost their homes due to the war between the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Celestial Demon Troupe. They’ve come here in droves seeking shelter.”

“Hmph!”

“Today alone, more than tens of thousands have arrived. It’s not just Taiyuan—every major city nearby is overwhelmed.”

The escort’s face was visibly angry.

The reason became clear moments later when they reached the city gates.

A crowd of wretched-looking refugees greeted them.

Emaciated and exhausted, they waited for a chance to enter the city. But the guards wouldn’t let them in.

Though Taiyuan was a historic city and the provincial capital, it had its limits. Letting in all the refugees would overwhelm the city and cause it to collapse.

Unable to enter, the refugees camped outside the gates or slept rough, barely surviving.

They looked pitiful. They barely covered their bodies with rags, and their faces looked emaciated.

No hope could be seen in their eyes—only emptiness.

“Tsk.”

“Ah…”

The escorts of the Iron Order Escort Agency couldn’t help but click their tongues at the sight. It pained them to see innocent people reduced to such misery because of the Jianghu’s conflicts.

The refugees didn’t even dare to ask for help. They just stared at the armed escorts with fearful eyes.

To them, any martial artist with a weapon was a killer—no different from the Celestial Demon Troupe or the Jade Heaven Alliance warriors who had destroyed their homes.

“Damn it. I can’t bear to look.”

Unable to take it any longer, Ki Ji-hwi turned his head away.

“Dad!”

Lee Soo-ah looked up at Lee Gwak with tearful eyes.

Lee Gwak patted her back and observed the refugees.

They were all ordinary people.

People who had lived their lives unrelated to the Jianghu, only to lose everything overnight.

Yet they didn’t even complain—just watched enviously as others entered the city.

Lee Gwak let out a heavy sigh.

“Hah…”

“It’s not your fault. There’s no need to blame yourself.”

“Brother?”

Lee Gwak looked up to see Seo Jong-myeong watching him with warm eyes.

“The blame lies with the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Celestial Demon Troupe for starting this war. You have no reason to feel responsible for what they’ve done. But if you’re troubled, it’s better to think about how to end this era of chaos as quickly as possible.”

“Thank you for the advice.”

“You would’ve realized it on your own anyway. I just said it out of caution.”

Seo Jong-myeong patted Lee Gwak’s shoulder before returning to his seat.

Meanwhile, their carriage passed through the city gates and entered Taiyuan.

The atmosphere inside was just as tense.

People on the streets were visibly on edge, eyeing outsiders with suspicion.

Lee Gwak bid farewell to Ji Sang-il.

“I think we should part ways here.”

“Won’t you come with us to Dragon Ship Dock? The master would be glad to meet you.”

“I’d love to, but I must return to Guangwu Sect as soon as possible.”

“I see.”

Ji Sang-il couldn’t hide his regret.

‘If only the Great Hero could stay with us, we’d be unstoppable.’

The leader of Dragon Ship Dock, Geum Cheong-hwan, was a close friend of Ji Sang-il’s.

A man of fiery righteousness, he had intended to join the war against the Celestial Demon Troupe. He had asked Ji Sang-il for weapons and manpower, which was why half of the Iron Order’s escorts were young recruits.

Lee Gwak’s group had noticed this early on.

After traveling together for over ten days, it would’ve been strange if they hadn’t. But they pretended not to know. Getting involved would only delay them further.

“If fate allows, we’ll meet again.”

“I’ll visit the Mad Martial Sect someday. Take care.”

After exchanging formal goodbyes, they went their separate ways.

Ji Sang-il gifted them horses.

Unable to refuse, Lee Gwak accepted.

Seo Jong-myung was now fully recovered and could ride alone, so their pace quickened.

After ten more days of riding, they finally arrived at Guangwu Sect.

“This is the Mad Martial Sect?”

Seo Jong-myeong looked at it with complex emotions.

This was where he would now live and protect.

His first impression was that it was solid.

The rushing Black River served as a natural moat, and the towering walls looked impenetrable. Behind the sect, a high mountain stood like a protective screen, making it resemble a fortress.

‘If used well, a hundred martial artists could hold off a thousand.’

Having long served as a fortress lord, Seo Jong-myeong immediately recognized its strategic value.

Plans for troop deployment and defense formed effortlessly in his mind.

He silently praised Lee Gwak’s foresight in choosing this location.

“Master, you’ve returned!”

“Welcome back, Master!”

The leaders rushed out to greet them.

“Mom!”

Lee Soo-ah, nestled in Han So-cheon’s arms, looked just like a little child.

Han So-cheon held Lee Soo-ah in his arms and quietly stroked her back. Her gaze was fixed on Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak smiled at Han So-cheon. Han So-cheon smiled back.

They didn’t say anything, but they could read and feel each other’s hearts.

“Master!”

“Brother!”

Next came Lim Sobo and Lim Jimun, the siblings.

Many others had also gathered to welcome Lee Gwak, but two figures stood out.

One man, large and strong; the other, a refined and beautiful woman.

Lee Gwak’s face lit up as he approached them.

“Brother Muk!”

“It’s been a while.”

The smiling man was Muk Cheon-gang. Beside him stood the Divine Physician Dam Surin.

Lee Gwak was truly surprised.

“How did you come here?”

“Surin insisted.”

“Divine Physician?”

“Yes. She said you’d need our help and brought us here.”

Lee Gwak looked at Dam Su-rin.

“It’s been a while, Master Lee!”

“I’m so glad to see you. How did you get here?”

“That man’s hometown is nearby. When we heard you’d founded a sect here on the Black River, we came.”

“Ah!”

Lee Gwak let out an exclamation.

Mok Cheon-gang’s roots were in Haedong, which wasn’t far from here. Geographically, it was much closer than other major sects.

Though they had left the Jianghu for a time, they had kept up with the news. That was how they learned Lee Gwak had founded the Mad Martial Sect by the Black River.

A man who had once wanted nothing more than to live quietly with his family had suddenly established a sect. The Lee Gwak Dam Su-rin knew was far from ambitious. There was no way he had done this for personal gain.

Understanding the circumstances, Dam Su-rin had come here to help him.

“I’ll stay here for a while and tend to the people.”

“Thank you. I will never forget this kindness.”

“If anything, I should be thanking you, Great Hero Lee. You could have lived in peaceful seclusion, yet you chose to step forward like this. The Mok family also wishes to support you, so don’t hesitate—use us wherever we’re needed.”

“Are you sure that’s alright?”

“Of course. That’s why I brought him here.”

Dam Su-rin smiled softly.

It was the arrival of an unexpected ally.
