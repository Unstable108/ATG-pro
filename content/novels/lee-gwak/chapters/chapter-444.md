Lee Gwak gritted his teeth.

The sinking of the Unma Riverboat had taken far more time than he had expected. If he had taken the Riverboat, he would have arrived at Taeho at least a day earlier. But what was done was done, and there was no turning back, so he forgot about it and pushed on.

So, after running relentlessly for several days and nights without rest, he finally arrived at Taeho.

The first thing he did upon arriving was head to Suzhou. That was where the local branch of the Hao Clan, which oversaw the entire Taeho region, was located.

But before he could even get there, chaos had already erupted in Suzhou.

Countless people were fleeing, escaping the clashes between the Hao Clan and the Heavenly Intelligence Hall.

Lee Gwak sensed he was a step too late. Still, he couldn’t just sit idly by and watch.

Without even taking a breath, he rushed straight toward Suzhou. From a distance, he spotted Hoe-an on the verge of death at the hands of the Heavenly Martial Squad.

Though Lee Gwak had no personal connection with Hoe-an, he knew that Hoe-an was Nam Woo-gyeong’s most trusted companion.

He also knew that Nam Woo-gyeong would be devastated if Hoe-an died.

That alone was enough for Lee Gwak to act without hesitation. He hurled Star Soul and intercepted Seok Pa-cheon’s strike.

The deflected sword embedded itself into the ground with a heavy thud.

Lee Gwak stretched out his hand.

He wasn’t consciously using any special technique like Void Capture.

He simply willed Star Soul to return to him. And as if obeying his unspoken command, the blade flew back into his grasp, drawn by an invisible force.

Perhaps it was some hidden mystery of the Dao. But that didn’t matter.

What mattered was that the warriors attacking Hoe-an were now charging at him, and they were moving with incredible speed and momentum.

Lee Gwak didn’t know who they were. Nor did he care.

The only thing he needed to know was that they were enemies.

Grip!

His grip on Star Soul tightened.

Thick veins popped on the back of his hand like earthworms.

Swish—!

Led by Seok Pa-cheon, the Heavenly Martial Squad martial artists fanned out like the ribs of a folding fan, closing in on Lee Gwak.

Just as they had done with Hoe An, the four of them attacked in unison.

They had already sensed that the man running toward them was far more dangerous than Hoe-an. The goosebumps and tingling sensations on their skin amplified their sense of danger.

‘Just who the hell is this guy?’

Their eyes instinctively focused on the blade in his hand.

A straight blade.

A powerful aura that seemed capable of slicing the world in two.

With just these two observations, deducing his identity wasn’t difficult.

Seok Pa-cheon shouted:

“Everyone be careful! The enemy is Sura Blade Lee Gwak!”

In all the world, there was only one martial artist whose mere presence with a blade could exude such overwhelming force.

Whether he was the best in the world was still debatable, but at least among those who wielded blade, Lee Gwak stood unrivaled.

Upon realizing their opponent was Lee Gwak, the eyes of the Heavenly Martial Squad martial artists gleamed.

They had all heard of his reputation. But none showed fear.

Lee Gwak was undoubtedly a formidable master, but they too possessed the power to challenge the world.

Especially the younger martial artists, the more youthful they were, the more they burned with competitive spirit.

The one truly wary of Lee Gwak was Seok Pa-cheon, the oldest. The others launched their attacks without a second thought.

“You’re supposed to be the best with a blade, huh?”

“Let’s see what you’ve got, punk!”

“Heh!”

Whoosh!

Their techniques surged toward Lee Gwak.

A storm of sword qi, fist qi, and whip strikes descended upon him.

The sword qi aimed for his head, the fist qi targeted his waist, and the woman’s whip lashed out, sealing off any possible escape route.

Even in this serious moment, Lee Gwak’s expression remained unchanged.

Only one thought filled his mind:

‘Cut.’

He didn’t waste time considering how to evade or counterattack.

Slice!

His blade sliced through the air.

The Heavenly Martial Squad martial artist, who had been in the lead, blinked.

His fist qi was being split apart.

At the same time, the sword qi and the martial artist behind it were cut down.

Slash!

“Guh!”

“Ack!”

The martial artists who had unleashed the fist and sword qi collapsed, disbelief etched on their faces. And a fountain of blood erupted from their throats.

The will imbued in his blade had one purpose only—to kill.

“I-it can’t be!”

Yeom Seol, the female martial artist who had used the whip, gasped.

The men that Lee Gwak had just cut down were known to be among the strongest in the Heavenly Martial Squad.

Especially in terms of sword and fist techniques, they were considered to rival even the Eight Great Martial Artists.

Yet Lee Gwak had cut them down with a single stroke.

It was incomprehensible to her. But Seok Pa-cheon understood.

Battles between masters could drag on endlessly or end in an instant, just like this.

Though it was hard to comprehend, it was reality.

Seok Pa-cheon shouted to Yeom Seol:

“Focus! Keep your eyes wide open or you’ll end up like them!”

“Tch!”

Yeom Seol snapped back to her senses.

But it was already too late.

Lee Gwak was upon her.

Buzz!

His posture was low, his body almost skimming the ground as he darted forward like a swallow skimming the water’s surface.

But to Yeom Seol, he did not resemble a swallow; rather, he resembled a bird of prey.

Slice!

A razor-sharp attack came for her throat.

The timing was perfect; she had no time to react.

At that moment, Seok Pa-cheon intervened.

“Watch out!”

Clang!

His sword deflected Lee Gwak’s blade.

Thanks to him, Yeom Seol survived. However, she had no time to be grateful. Lee Gwak’s blade had already curved in midair and was coming for her again.

“Tch!”

Yeom Seol gritted her teeth and swung her whip in a wide arc. The whip curled around her, crackling with energy.

Iron Wall Defense Art.

Her defense technique.

The whip, filled with internal energy, could obliterate most attacks instantly.

Its name wasn’t for nothing; it was like an iron wall.

Slice!

But even the iron wall was useless against Lee Gwak’s blade.

Like a blade slicing through paper, his blade cleaved through her defense and appeared before her eyes.

Yeom Seol screamed involuntarily.

She had never imagined her most reliable technique could be neutralized so easily.

“Stop!”

Seok Pa-cheon intervened again.

His sword sliced through the space between Lee Gwak and Yeom Seol, blocking the attack.

At that moment, Lee Gwak struck Seok Pa-cheon’s sword with his left hand.

Twang!

The sword bent and rebounded violently, leaving Yeom Seol’s face completely exposed.

Her pale face met Lee Gwak’s eyes.

Until now, until this moment, she had never once thought of herself dying.

She had never considered the possibility of her own death until now.

Even moments ago, when fighting Hoe-an, she hadn’t imagined dying. There were four of them, and they had always overpowered opponents with ease.

It had even felt boring.

But now, she realized just how arrogant she had been.

Thrust!

Lee Gwak’s blade pierced her throat.

Though it was her own flesh being cut, it felt like someone else’s body.

Then came the fiery pain and a spray of blood.

“Yeom Seol!”

Seok Pa-cheon cried out and rushed toward her. But she couldn’t respond.

Her mind was already drifting into darkness.

What kind of absurd existence is this…?

That was her final thought.

The world turned black.

“LEE GWAK!!”

Seok Pa-cheon’s furious roar shook the heavens.

He had cherished Yeom Seol like a granddaughter. Though she was arrogant, he had always forgiven her.

Her death ignited his wrath.

Seok Pa-cheon’s sword gleamed with sword qi.

The sword aura qi nearly three meters high, carrying the full force of his lifetime of cultivation.

Not all sword qi was equal, it depended on one’s internal energy and enlightenment.

Seok Pa-cheon’s was near the pinnacle.

Even top masters would hesitate to face it.

But Lee Gwak charged straight in.

He knew Seok Pa-cheon was strong.

Among the Heavenly Martial Squad martial artists here, his aura was the most chilling, the most intense.

But Lee Gwak didn’t care.

His opponent’s strength was irrelevant.

The only things that mattered were his own skill and resolve.

Any hesitation would only push Seok Pa-cheon further out of reach.

Slice!

Lee Gwak swung his blade with full force.

It was a plain strike, no blade qi, no blade aura.

But that plain strike cut through Seok Pa-cheon’s sword qi in an instant.

“Ugh!”

Seok Pa-cheon looked stunned.

This had never happened to him before.

It was common knowledge in the Jianghu: only qi could counter qi. But Lee Gwak shattered that belief today.

Heaven-Killing Blade.

A blade technique that claimed to slay even the heavens was now showing its full power.

Though Lee Gwak’s face bore no trace of killing intent, to Seok Pa-cheon, he looked more terrifying than any demon.

So this is the killing intent of Sura Blade…

Slash!

Lee Gwak’s blade cut Seok Pa-cheon’s side.

It was a severe wound, his muscles were torn apart,and his internal organs burst out.

Clutching his side, Seok Pa-cheon tried to counterattack. But before he could, Lee Gwak’s blade pierced his throat.

Stab!

“Ghk—!”

Seok Pa-cheon’s eyes bulged.

Through the blade embedded in his neck, he saw Lee Gwk’s expressionless face.

“Grrk… Su…ra…”

He tried to grab Lee Gwak.

But Lee Gwak coldly withdrew his blade.

Seok Pa-cheon collapsed to the ground, staring at Lee Gwak’s retreating back, and then closed his eyes forever.

He had been a formidable martial artist, not someone who should’ve died so easily. The same went for all the martial artists of the Heavenly Martial Squad.

But they were dead, and Lee Gwak didn’t spare them a glance.

His only concern was Nam Woo-gyeong’s survival, and for that, he needed Hoe-an.

“Are you alright? Stay with me.”

Lee Gwak cradled Hoe-an and took out a Life-Saving Pill.

Crafted by the Divine Physician Dam Soo-rin, its efficacy was beyond question.

After taking the pill, color slowly returned to Hoe-an’s pale face.

“Stay with me.”

“Lee… Gwak? It really is you.”

Hoe-an opened his eyes and recognized him.

“Where is brother Woo-gyeonng?”

“He should’ve escaped Suzhou.”

“You don’t know where he went?”

“There’s a… a safe house. Head north of Taeho…”

Hoe-an spoke weakly.

His voice was faint and slurred. Lee Gwak had to concentrate with all his focus just to make out the words.

Finally, Hoe-an finished his explanation.

“P…please protect the Clan Lord. You’re…the only one I can trust.”

“Clan Lord? Has Brother Woo-gyeong become the Sect Master?”

“Yes, he has.”

“I’ll do my utmost.”

“I’m counting on you. Don’t worry about me—just go.”

“Will you be alright on your own?”

“This…won’t kill me.”

Hoe-an answered with great difficulty.

His condition was terrible, his body broken in nearly every way, like a candle about to go out or a bowl on the verge of shattering.

And yet, even in that state, Hoe-an thought only of Nam Woo-gyeong’s safety.

“There’s no time to waste. Go now.”

“Please take care of yourself.”

Lee Gwak gave Hoe-an a respectful bow, then dashed off in the direction he had been given.

Watching Lee Gwak disappear into the distance, Hwaean muttered to himself,

“Can he really stand against Ja Hong-cheon…?”
