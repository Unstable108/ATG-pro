Nam Woo Gyeong clenched his fists tightly.

His eyes were so wide they looked like they might pop out of his head.

His heart was beating so hard it felt like it could stop at any moment.

The scene before him was that shocking.

It was none other than the Gatekeeper Assassin, Moon Gwang.

His nickname was derived from the belief that those visited by him could not escape death.

He was, as his nickname implied, a harbinger of death.

Although he ceased most of his activities in the Jianghu after becoming an elder of the White Light Sect, many of the older martial artists still remembered him.

In their memories, Moon Gwang was synonymous with fear.

Such was the immense reputation of the Gatekeeper Assassin, Moon Gwang.

Now, this formidable martial artist was kneeling on one knee, vomiting blood.

It was a scene Nam Woo Gyeong had never imagined, which made it all the more terrifying.

In front of the kneeling Moon Gwang stood Lee Gwak, fully upright.

Though pale and breathing heavily, he stood firmly on his two legs.

Drip! Drip!

Crimson blood dripped down Lee Gwak’s blade.

The severe silence that dominated the street amplified even the smallest sounds.

They feared breaking the oppressive silence.

Everyone was overwhelmed by the scene before them.

Nam Woo Gyeong was among them.

He was on his way back from finishing his business at the Hao Clan branch. As he approached the inn, Lee Gwak and Moon Gwang had broken through the roof and started a duel.

The shock he felt then was indescribable.

Although Lee Gwak was a master strong enough to defeat Woo Mun Pae, Moon Gwang’s martial prowess was not to be underestimated.

The decades of experience and cunning he possessed made him an even more formidable opponent.

Therefore, Nam Woo Gyeong had cautiously anticipated Lee Gwak’s defeat. However, contrary to his expectations, Lee Gwak won

It was a result that exceeded even Nam Woo Gyeong ‘s understanding of Lee Gwak. That made it even more chilling..

‘Just who is this guy…’

He shuddered involuntarily.

Suddenly, such a thought struck him.

‘That guy is the real deal. A true martial artist.’

In the current Jianghu, filled with schemers and those who relied on the power of their sects or factions, here was someone who shone purely through his own strength.

Lee Gwak was such a person.

While looking up at Lee Gwak, Moon Gwang vomited blood violently.

In the expelled blood were finely shredded pieces of his internal organs, sliced by Lee Gwak’s blade, indicating the severe internal damage inflicted.

Moon Gwang’s followers, witnessing the scene, rushed forward to aid him.

They had held back, considering Moon Gwang’s dignity, but now they could no longer do so. Moon Gwang was not someone who should die in such a place.

Even if it meant diminishing his reputation in the Jianghu, they had to save him and return him to the White Light Sect.

As they launched their attack towards Lee Gwak…

“Brother!”

With a booming cry, something huge intercepted the onslaught with its body, shielding Lee Gwak.

Crack! Snap!

The swords of the attackers snapped upon impact with the giant’s body as easily as dry reeds. Caught off guard by the unexpected development, the attackers were then struck by a counterattack.

They were thrown back by the forceful blow, limbs grotesquely twisted.

The giant who had defended Lee Gwak and retaliated against the attackers was none other than Cheol Gwang Woo.

Cheol Gwang Woo noticed that one of the fallen attackers was reaching into his robes.

Cheol Gwang Woo twisted the attacker’s wrist.

The attacker’s wrist twisted grotesquely, and a bag filled with white powder fell to the ground.

“Do you think I’d fall for the same trick twice?”

Cheol Gwang Woo, puffing angrily, picked up the bag. The white powder inside was Demon Soul Powder.

Having previously fallen victim to the Demon Soul Powder, Cheol Gwang Woo’s reaction was fierce.

With a stomp, the head of the attacker attempting to use Demon Soul Powder exploded like a squashed pumpkin.

Still unsatisfied, Cheol Gwang Woo scanned the surroundings with a menacing glare.

Lee Gwak swung his blade, shaking off the blood, and sheathed it.

Then, Moon Gwang lifted his head to look up at Lee Gwak.

“Krgh! I tried not to be swept away by the waves in front of the Yangtze, but in the end, I, too, am pushed back by you.”

“Lee Gwak, my death will undoubtedly bring you immense fame. But remember, great fame often invites great danger.”

“I’ll keep that in mind.”

“Ugh! I never thought the end of Moon Gwang would be this… pathetic. Ugh! Lord… you’ll be troubled too. With such a martial artist appearing….”

Moon Gwang’s voice gradually grew quieter until it finally stopped. He had passed away.

Lee Gwak looked down at Moon Gwang with a complex expression.

Though he had toppled a legend of the Jianghu, the victory didn’t feel entirely satisfying.

Lee Gwak sighed and shook his head.

Then, Nam Woo Gyeong approached Lee Gwak.

“Good job. Who would have thought you could take down Moon Gwang, the Gatekeeper Assassin? You’ve nearly melted my liver with worry.”

“Brother!”

“Leave the cleaning up to me, and you go in and rest.”

“In situations like this, it is important to deal with the aftermath. I’ll take care of it, you just rest”.

“Alright!”

“Also, formally challenging Moon Gwang to a duel was a smart move. It’ll make cleaning up much easier.”

Nam Woo Gyeong patted Lee Gwak’s shoulder.

Lee Gwak nodded and headed inside the inn. The inn, with its roof pierced through, was in chaos.

Lee Gwak apologized to the innkeeper.

“I’m sorry for the trouble caused because of me… I’ll compensate for the damages.”

“No, it’s alright, grand master. This damage can be easily fixed. Don’t worry about it. In fact, thanks to you, our inn will become famous, which is a good thing.”

The innkeeper smiled broadly.

The damage was easily repairable; in fact, calling it damage was an understatement. The fame gained from this incident was far more valuable than any repairs.

After apologizing once more to the innkeeper, Lee Gwak entered his new room, generously provided by the innkeeper as his previous room was destroyed during the fight with Moon Gwang.

After Lee Gwak entered the inn, Nam Woo Gyeong summoned the Hao Clan members to take care of the bodies and spread a certain rumor throughout the Jianghu.

It was rumored that one of the Four Heavenly Kings of the White Light Sect, Gatekeeper Assassin Moon Gwang, had fought a fair duel with a young martial artist.

Many witnesses on the streets corroborated the story of Lee Gwak formally challenging Moon Gwang.

Moon Gwang’s death in a fair duel meant that the White Light Sect couldn’t blame Lee Gwak without tarnishing their own reputation.

Nam Woo Gyeong deliberately spread the rumor far and wide.

The rumor emphasized that the young martial artist who had defeated the Gatekeeper Assassin Moon Gwang was the same person who had defeated one of the Ten Lesser Skies, the Mad Dragon Woo Mun Pae.

Until now, the news of Lee Gwak defeating Woo Mun Pae hadn’t spread widely, as people feared repercussions from the Martial Sword Troupe.

Lee Gwak was a newcomer to the Jianghu, and Woo Mun Pae had the backing of being the heir to the Martial Sword Troupe.

People naturally hesitated to speak against the Martial Sword Troupe. But now, the situation had changed.

Lee Gwak, having defeated Gatekeeper Assassin Moon Gwang, was no longer just any martial artist. He had surpassed being merely lucky against Woo Mun Pae.

Sura Blade Lee Gwak.

This was the moment his name emerged prominently in the history of the Jianghu. *** White Light Sect was situated on the Yong Jiang plains.

Surrounded by forests, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that White Light Sect was surrounded by greenery. Dense, green foliage surrounded the White Light Sect for miles, filling the air with the scent of flowers in the spring.

For this reason, the local people also called the White Light Sect the Flower City.

Surrounded by a vast forest, White Light Sect was filled with countless mechanical traps, making it impossible to approach recklessly.

Though beautiful to behold, it was an impenetrable fortress, and that place was the White Light Sect.

White Light Sect consisted of dozens of large and small pavilions.

As if to prove their wealth, the pavilions were extremely lavish. Among them, the most splendid was the residence of the master of the White Light Sect.

Inside a grand room within the pavilion was a Grand armchair, the epitome of luxury.

In front of the Grand armchair was a long table made of hardwood, with chairs on either side for people to sit.

Sitting on the Grand armchair was an elderly man who appeared to be in his sixties.

The old man was so fat that his eyes and nose were barely visible, buried in his flesh, reminiscent of a round ball.

He was Won Gung-yeo, the master of White Light Sect.

In front of Won Gung-yeo, a middle-aged man in his forties from the White Light Sect was bowing his waist.

It was Jin Go-gwang, Won Gung-yeo’s confidant.

Jin Go-gwang was Won Gong-yeo’s strategist and chief administrator, handling all the major and minor affairs of the White Light Sect.

After hearing Jin Go-gwang’s report, Won Gung-yeo tapped the handle of his armchair with his fingers.

“So you’re saying that the Gatekeeper Assassin Moon Gwang lost his life to an unknown martial artist of the Jianghu?…”

“My apologies.”

“All the money spent on that old man… What a significant loss. Tsk!”

Won Gung-yeo clicked his tongue.

There was no sign of regret on his face for Moon Gwang’s death.

“So, we couldn’t capture O Se-ui?”

“I’m sorry.”

“This is really annoying. A traitor appears in the sect, and the old man sent to capture the traitor loses his life to an unknown lowly martial artist. The loss is not minor. What’s the probability of things getting sour with Yong Cheon Myeong?”

“There is a possibility that he might cut ties before things escalate, but it’s not very likely. As long as the second Young Master, Woon Dae Yeon, is supported by the Myriad Merchants Troupe, it will be difficult for Yong Cheon-myeong to cut ties easily. However, considerable compensation will be needed to deal with the situation.

“Fuck! More money will have to be spent. Make sure you handle this well.”

“Wouldn’t it be better to deploy the Blood Rain Assassins?”

“Are you suggesting an assassination within the Jade Heaven Alliance now?”

“Hmph! It seems your judgment has dulled with age. Even a decaying fish is still valuable. Besides, the Jade Heaven Alliance’s authority is at its peak. Any misstep, and it won’t just be the Blood Rain Assassins but the entire White Light Sect itself that will be in jeopardy.”

“The Assassin King is very familiar with the internal geography of the Jade Heaven Alliance. With her, O Se-ui can be eliminated, and she can safely escape.”

Won Gung-yeo looked intrigued.

Assassin King, the leader of the Blood Rain Assassins, could be said to have reached a divine level in assassination. Her technique was flawless.

However, the Assassin King rarely acted personally. After all, her contract stipulated not to carry out assassinations herself but to nurture the Blood Rain Assassins.

“Will the Assassin King accept the order?”

“If she wants to ensure her children’s future, she has no choice but to accept, even if she dislikes it.”

“Assassin King is indeed the best card to play right now.”

“Good! I will allow the mobilization of the Assassin King. But only this once. The value of a trump card diminishes if it is used too often.

“Of course.”

“Alright! Let’s conclude that matter and move on to the person who killed Moon Gwang.”

“Are you referring to Lee Gwak?”

“Yes! Lee Gwak. Is it true that he defeated the Mad Dragon?”

“It is true.”

“Unexpected. That a martial artist strong enough to defeat the Mad Dragon has remained unknown in the Jianghu.”

“There’s another interesting fact.”

“What is it?”

“Well, that is…”

Jin Go-gwang hesitated in response to Won Gung-yeo’s question, piquing his interest. It had been a long time since Jin Go-gwang showed such hesitation.

After a pause, Jin Go-gwang finally continued.

“The man known as Lee Gwak is currently traveling with Nam Woo Gyeong.”

“Nam Woo Gyeong of the Hao Clan?”

“That’s quite a coincidence. To be traveling with Nam Woo Gyeong of all people.”

Won Gung-yeo’s eyes, buried in his flesh, shone sharply.

The Blood Rain Assassins had grown with the support of the White Light Sect. And Nam Woo Gyeong was a thorn in their side, an annoying presence that had penetrated the Blood Rain Assassins. They had attempted to eliminate him but had failed, according to reports.

Until then, it wasn’t considered a significant concern. The existence of the Blood Rain Assassins was strictly confidential, and it was nearly impossible to discover, even with the Hao Clan’s information-gathering capabilities.

O Se-ui and the Blood Rain Assassins.

They were secrets of the White Light Sect that must never be revealed. And Lee Gwak was entangled in both.

Won Gung-yeo muttered to himself.

“Lee Gwak… It seems we are indeed fated to be adversaries.”

“It won’t be easy to remove him immediately. His challenge has been made public in a fair duel, and his reputation resonates throughout the Jianghu.”

“Then we must wait. Isn’t waiting what we do best? Heh!”

Won Gung-yeo lifted his hefty body.

Jin Go-gwang hurriedly supported him.

“Where shall I escort you?”

“To grandmother’s residence. I haven’t visited her in a while; she must be feeling lonely.”

A smile appeared on Won Gung-yeo’s lips.

Though Won Gung-yeo was the master of White Light Sect, it was his grandmother who founded White Light Sect.

To the members of White Light Sect, she was a figure of terror, but to Won Gung-yeo, she was always a family member offering a warm embrace.
