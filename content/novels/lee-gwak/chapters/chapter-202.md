Yong Cheon Myeong recalled the young girl he had just passed.

The young girl, whom the head of the Secret Court, Yeo Joong Wol, had long nurtured, was now coming into her own.

The fact that the Secret Court was still running smoothly despite Yeo Joong Wol’s seclusion was proof of this.

If possible, Yong Cheon Myeong wanted to bring Lim Sobo into his side. However, he knew better than anyone that it was impossible.

The Secret Court fundamentally adhered to the principle of not getting involved in the power struggles of the Jade Heaven Alliance. Attempting to draw the Secret Court and Lim Sobo in would only result in significant backlash.

The Secret Court had to be gradually taken over. Moreover, he had Gu Mun-hoe, a strategist who was in no way inferior to Yeo Joong Wol.

While traditional military strategy might not catch up to Yeo Joong Wol, in terms of various dark schemes and cunning, Gu Mun-hoe could surpass Yeo Joong Wol.

“Senior brother, where are you rushing off to?”

Just then, a voice called out to Yong Cheon Myeong. Coming out of his thoughts, he looked towards the source of the voice and saw a familiar face.

Upon seeing him, Yong Cheon Myeong’s expression stiffened slightly.

The man wore a scholar’s robe tinged with a reddish hue.

With vivid features, pale skin and deep black eyes, he looked unrealistically handsome.

Among the many martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance, there was only one man who possessed such unreal beauty.

“It has been a while, brother.”

The one greeting him calmly was his junior brother, Woon Dae Yon.

His gaze towards Woon Dae Yon was cold. However, Yong Cheon Myeong quickly composed himself and smiled.

“Indeed, It’s been a while, junior brother.”

“Where are you rushing off to, senior brother?”

“I have been summoned by our master.”

For a moment, a crack appeared in Woon Dae Yon’s composed expression.

Seeing this, a faint smile appeared on Yong Cheon Myeong’s face. It was satisfying.

People often said that Woon Dae Yon had no desire for power.

They described him as someone without any ambition for power, characterizing him as a true martial artist dedicated solely to the pursuit of martial excellence. But Yong Cheon Myeong knew how ridiculous that was.

Woon Daeyeon was not indifferent to power.

He was as thirsty for power as Yong Cheon Myeong himself, if not more so.

He had simply concealed this fact well from the outside world. In essence, he was not much different from Yong Cheon Myeong.

The desire burning in Woon Dae Yon’s eyes proved it. Others might not see it, but it was clear to Yong Cheon Myeong.

Woon Dae Yon forced a calm expression and asked.

“Why did our master summon you alone?”

“How would I know the master’s intentions? He called, so I go. Where are you going, junior brother?”

“I am going out to greet a guest.”

“A guest? So you have recruited another martial artist from the outside world. You do enjoy making new connections. How long has it been since you befriended the leader of the Myriad Merchant Troupe, and now you are bringing someone into the alliance again?”

“Haha! It’s nothing compared to you, senior brother. People always flock around you. I’m just trying to learn from your good example.”

“Thank you for always worrying about me. Indeed, no one gives me better advice than you, senior brother.”

“I hope that feeling lasts a while. Now go on, I must see the master.”

Woon Dae Yon bowed to Yong Cheon Myeong.

Yong Cheon Myeong smirked as he watched him bow.

Although it wasn’t visible due to the bowed head, Yong Cheon Myeong could imagine Woon Dae Yon’s expression contorting.

In reality, Woon Dae Yon’s face was so contorted that his blood vessels were visible.

He felt Woon Dae Yeon’s piercing gaze on his back but ignored it. What mattered now was not Woon Dae Yeon’s checks.

He was summoned by Ja Hong Cheon, his master.

‘Why has that old man called me again? What does he want this time?’

As Yong Cheon Myeong thought of Ja Hong Cheon, a subtle killing intent appeared in his eyes.

His gaze was so fierce that it was hard to believe he was thinking about his master.

As the main hall of the Jade Heaven Alliance became visible, Yong Cheon Myeong forced himself to appear calm.

After passing several checkpoints, he arrived at Ja Hong Cheon’s residence, the Blue Dragon Hall. His own residence, the Blue Sky Hall, had also been expanded, but it couldn’t compare to the Blue Dragon Hall.

Yong Cheon Myeong looked up at the Blue Dragon Hall for a moment before entering.

Inside the Blue Dragon Hall, there was a massive throne carved from a blue stone. An elderly man, whose age was indiscernible, sat on the throne.

The ordinary-looking elderly man was none other than the leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance and Yong Cheon Myeong’s master, Ja Hong Cheon.

Limitless Sword EmperorJa Hong Cheon.

The absolute ruler of the Jianghu was gazing down at Yong Cheon Myeong.

Yong Cheon Myeong knelt on one knee towards Ja Hong Cheon in greeting.

“Disciple Cheon Myeong greets Master.”

“It has been a while, Cheon Myeong.”

“My apologies, Master. My foolishness has kept me away for too long.”

“No, I am aware of your busy endeavors.”

“I am grateful for your understanding. May I inquire the reason for summoning me?”

Yong Cheon Myeong looked up at Ja Hong Cheon, his gaze challenging.

A smile played on Ja Hong Cheon’s lips as he observed Yong Cheon Myeong.

The indiscernible smile made Yong Cheon Myeong feel an inexplicable sense of foreboding.

“Well, that’s also one of your strengths. Fine, let’s get to the point. I am planning to convene the Heavenly Assembly soon.”

“The Heavenly Assembly… ? You mean to gather all the leaders of the Ten Sects?”

Despite Ja Hong Cheon’s calm response, Yong Cheon Myeong couldn’t hide his astonishment.

Since the Great Heavenly Blood War, the order of the Jianghu has been solidified around the Ten Sects. However, in the span of a hundred years, there had never been an occasion where all the leaders of the Ten Sects were gathered in one place.

They were each sovereigns of their own domains, with immense pride. They seldom left their territories for any trivial matter.

The fact that not one of the leaders of the Ten Sects had visited the Jade Heaven Alliance in the past hundred years spoke volumes about their immense pride.

Yong Cheon Myeong stated emphatically. However, Ja Hong Cheon’s expression remained unchanged.

“That is something we won’t know until we try.”

“Master, they are each absolute rulers of their regions. It won’t be easy to gather those who haven’t visited in over a hundred years.”

“True, it’s not an easy task. But it’s not impossible either.”

“Cheon Myeong! Since when did you start contradicting my words?”

“Your thoughts, your intentions, they are not at all important. You just need to do as I say.”

Yong Cheon Myeong’s forehead tensed with visible veins.

Trying to contain an unbearable sense of humiliation, he clenched his teeth so hard that his jaw muscles twitched involuntarily.

Ja Hong Cheon looked directly at Yong Cheon Myeong.

A faint smile lingered on his lips.

“It seems you are under some misunderstanding.”

“Do you think you’ve become something significant because people hail you as a hero? Do you feel closer to being my true successor?”

“Your current position, your fame, all of it was given by me. Without my backing, what have you achieved on your own? I was the one who transformed you from a dog running with its tail between its legs into what you are now.”

Yong Cheon Myeong couldn’t hold back his feelings of humiliation and let out a harsh breath.

When he returned from the Celestial Demon Troupe six years ago, he was practically a broken man. His body was intact, but his mind was shattered.

As a result, he secluded himself for nearly a year, committing all kinds of atrocities. Unable to cope with the sudden outbursts of violence, he killed more than a dozen people.

It was a fatal flaw for a successor of the Jade Heaven Alliance. Ja Hong Cheon was the one who protected Yong Cheon Myeong from external scrutiny and repackaged his image.

However, there was no such thing as kindness without a price. Since then, Ja Hong Cheon had used Yong Cheon Myeong entirely for his own purposes. Due to his disqualifying flaws, Yong Cheon Myeong had no choice but to follow even the most unreasonable orders from Ja Hong Cheon.

Thick tendons bulged on Yong Cheon Myeong’s tightly clenched fist. Ja Hong Cheon looked at him indifferently and said,

“Don’t forget, Cheon Myeong. Without me, you are nothing.”

“Send invitations to the leaders of the Ten Sects.”

“I will dutifully follow your command.”

A satisfied smile appeared on Ja Hong Cheon’s face.

“There was a violent clash at the inn at the city, Captain.”

Seok Yi Cheon frowned deeply upon hearing the report from his subordinate.

Maintaining peace outside the city walls was also one of the Outer Hall’s duties. And it was the time for the seventeenth squad to patrol.

This meant that investigating the incident at the inn was the responsibility of the seventeenth squad.

“It was the Mysterious Elder Nam Cheon-yang and an unidentified young master.”

“Good heavens! Then Nam Cheon-yang must have crushed the young master. How do we handle this?”

Seok Yi Cheon’s expression paled.

Nam Cheon-yang was a master invited by Woon Dae Yon. Seok Yi Cheon was well aware of his notorious reputation.

With Yong Cheon Myeong and Woon Dae Yon competing to invite external masters, such problems were erupting everywhere. The ones who ended up dead were often martial artists from the outer hall.

Among them were some too formidable for the outer hall to handle, and Nam Cheon-yang was one of those heavyweights.

Seok Yi Cheon naturally assumed that Nam Cheon-yang had severely injured the young master.

“It was Nam Cheon-yang who got crushed.”

“What nonsense are you talking about?”

“It’s no nonsense. The young master subdued Nam Cheon-yang in an instant. That’s causing an uproar in Woon Dae Yon’s faction. The master they had gone to great lengths to invite has been turned half into an invalid.”

The subordinate agreed with Seok Yi Cheon’s comment.

It would have been easier to manage if Nam Cheon-yang had subdued the young master. After all, Nam Cheon-yang was a well-recognized elder master in the Jianghu, and it could have been spun as him imparting a lesson to a younger martial artist.

However, the situation was reversed, and that was problematic.

Woon Dae Yon, who had gone to great lengths to invite the elder master, would not sit idly by after his guest was defeated by a young master.

“What’s the name of this young master?”

“Yes! He didn’t reveal his name, so no one knows. It seems like the military advisor from the Secret Court might know, but…”

Lim Sobo wasn’t someone he could just approach and question. Even though she had Cheon Wol by her side, it was not his place to inquire. It would be burdensome for Cheon Wol.

He couldn’t impose that burden on Cheon Wol.

“However, I did find out where the young master was staying.”

“Why didn’t you say so sooner?”

“Is that something to say? Lead the way, kid!”

The subordinate, having been scolded for no good reason, looked sullen but proceeded to guide the way.

Seok Yi Cheon, just to be safe, called all members of the seventeenth squad.

As twenty martial artists from the outer hall stepped out in force, people on the streets moved aside in surprise and alarm.

The place the subordinate led them to was on the northern street outside the city.

As they delved deeper into the northern street, Seok Yi Cheon’s face lit up with a nostalgic light. It was because Lee Gwak’s house was located in this vicinity.

He had deliberately avoided coming to this area for a while because passing through reminded him of Lee Gwak.

Pushing aside his memories, he continued walking.

After a while they came to a street full of brothels. The place they were led to was in front of the largest brothel, the Crimson Flower Brothel.

“Are you sure this is the place?”

“Yes! A witness said he went into this place.”

Seok Yi Cheon’s face crumpled with doubt at the subordinate’s answer. He found it hard to believe the subordinate’s words.

But now that they were here, it was impossible to turn back without checking.

Seok Yi Cheon knocked heavily on the door of the Crimson Flower Brothel.

“Is anyone there? We’re from Jade Heaven Alliance.”

After a moment, the door opened slightly, and someone’s face appeared.

Upon recognizing the face, Seok Yi Cheon looked as if he was about to cry.

“You… why are you coming out of there?”
