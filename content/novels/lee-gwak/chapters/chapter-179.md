Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo left the Hwado Branch of the Hao Clan.

Although Lee Gwak did not obtain the information he desired, the thought that Nam Woo Gyeong might visit him at any time lightened his heart.

As they walked away from the Hwado Branch, they noticed a place crowded with an unusually large number of people. It was in front of the Cheong family estate, where the birthday feast for Cheongunbi was taking place.

The normally tightly closed main gate was wide open, and numerous people freely came and went.

Cheol Gwang Woo looked at Lee Gwak with eager eyes.

The scent of food wafting through the open gate was enticing him. Considering it was Cheongunbi’s birthday feast, the food served would be exceptional.

“Brother! Could we stop by to take a look?”

“Are you hungry?”

“Hehe! I’ve never seen anything like this before…”

Cheol Gwang Woo twisted his body awkwardly, rubbing his hands together. It was as if a bear was acting coy.

Lee Gwak chuckled and said,

“Well! Since we’re here, it wouldn’t hurt to take a look.”

“Thank you, brother.”

“Let’s go in.”

Cheol Gwang Woo led the way with a smile.

The two managed to push through the crowd and enter the Cheong family estate.

When they entered the main gate, they saw a huge performance hall with a blue stone floor.

Inside, there were countless tables and chairs lined up in rows, with people filling every empty seat.

At the front of the training ground, a large platform was erected, where an elderly man, presumably Cheongunbi, was seated in a grand manner, receiving congratulations from the attendees.

“I congratulate you on your birthday, Master Cheong. Thanks to you, order is maintained in Hwado. Please take care of your health and continue to be the light of Hwado for a long time. In that spirit, I have brought Snow Ginseng, a gift that was difficult to obtain from the Snowy Mountains.”

“Oh my! Thank you so much. I will remember your kindness and sincerity, Master Oh.”

Influential figures from the region and renowned martial artists lined up to present gifts and greetings to Cheongunbi. In return, Cheongunbi welcomed them with a friendly smile.

The long queue demonstrated Cheongunbi’s current status.

Cheongunbi stroked his long white beard that reached down to his chest while smiling continuously.

A familiar face was seen next to Cheongunbi.

The person sitting on the left with a haughty expression was Woo Mun Pae, the young master of the Martial Sword Troupe.

Their departure from the Martial Sword Troupe during the Haemu Festival was precisely to attend Cheongunbi’s birthday feast.

Although the Cheong family estate was not officially part of the Martial Sword Troupe, they maintained a friendly relationship. Given Cheongunbi’s prestige in the Jianghu, the Martial Sword Troupe had to pay their respects. Thus, they sent Woo Mun Pae .

They believed only someone of Woo Mun Pae’s stature could match Cheongunbi’s rank. Woo Mun Pae congratulated Cheongunbi and delivered a gift from the Martial Sword Troupe’s leader, Yoo Mun-sang. However, his attitude was quite arrogant, which was irritating.

In fact, Cheongunbi did not like being involved with the Martial Sword Troupe. He knew their methods too well.

Initially, they treated Cheongunbi as an equal, but after some time, they would start to exploit him as if he were one of their subordinates.

Because of this, Cheongunbi greatly disliked being associated with the Martial Sword Troupe and had avoided them until now. However, with the direct visit from Woo Mun Pae, the Young master of the Martial Sword Troupe, avoidance was no longer an option.

In the end, Cheongunbi accommodated him by placing him in a seat right next to him, but he couldn’t help but feel uneasy.

Lee Gwak’s gaze shifted to the far end of the platform. He saw Lee Won-chang, the head of the Shenyang Courier Service, seated at the furthest position from Cheongunbi. Yet, he looked quite elated.

Many others didn’t even get a seat on the platform and had to sit at the tables below.

Just being seated on the platform was enough to show that one’s relationship with Cheongunbi was by no means light.

Lee Won-chang thought that was sufficient.

Looking at the people on the platform, there wasn’t a single person less significant than him.

Lee Won-chang quietly sipped his drink.

He planned to leave shortly.

He was concerned about his escort duties, and as the head of the escort service, being away from his post for an extended period also weighed on his mind.

Lee Won-chang was so engrossed in his thoughts that he was unaware of Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo’s presence at the birthday feast

Meanwhile, Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo managed to find a vacant spot to sit.

A broad smile spread across Cheol Gwang Woo’s face.

This was because the table was filled with exquisite delicacies. Servants and maids were bustling about, replenishing the food as soon as it diminished, leaving Cheol Gwang Woo’s eyes spinning with delight.

“Brother, I’m going to start eating.”

“Go ahead!”

Cheol Gwang Woo began to devour the food as if possessed, his fervor so intense that those nearby were taken aback and stared with wide eyes.

They had never seen anyone eat as voraciously as Cheol Gwang Woo.

“Wow! That’s impressive.”

“At this rate, we’ll run out of food.”

They looked at Cheol Gwang Woo with eyes wide in amazement. However, Cheol Gwang Woo himself paid no mind to their gazes.

To Cheol Gwang Woo, the only thing that mattered was the opportunity to eat to his heart’s content.

Lee Gwak gave a wry smile.

While Cheol Gwang Woo was indifferent to the stares of others, he was not.

Eventually, Lee Gwak gave up on eating and began to sip his drink.

At that moment, some individuals approached their table.

They were Yook Cheon-ban and Gu Ok-rin, who had come to Cheongunbi’s birthday feast with Woo Mun Pae.

“Even if you’re hungry, should you not maintain some dignity in front of so many people?”

Yook Cheon-ban looked at Cheol Gwang Woo, who was holding food in both hands, with a contemptuous gaze.

Cheol Gwang Woo’s eyebrows shot up. A sneer appeared on Yook Cheon-ban’s lips.

“I said to keep your dignity. You bear.”

Cheol Gwang Woo slammed the table and stood up, causing the table to break and the food to scatter everywhere.

“What the! What’s going on?”

“Damn it! How filthy…”

The people nearby screamed in shock.

The sudden commotion attracted the attention of those around them.

A deep frown formed between Lee Gwak’s brows, sensing that Yook Cheon-ban was deliberately picking a fight.

Lee Gwak looked up at Woo Mun Pae who was sitting on the platform. It seemed that Woo Mun Pae was also looking at Lee Gwak as their eyes met in the air.

Woo Mun Pae was smiling.

Lee Gwak instinctively realized that this situation was orchestrated by Woo Mun Pae.

Though he did not know the reason, it was clear that Woo Mun Pae had instructed Yook Cheon-ban to deliberately start trouble.

“Gwang-woo!”

Lee Gwak urgently called out to Cheol Gwang Woo. However, Cheol Gwang Woo did not respond, his anger already boiling over.

Lee Gwak called out again, more forcefully.

“Gwang-woo!”

“Yes! Brother…”

Cheol Gwang Woo managed to reply, but his eyes were still fixed on Yook Cheon-ban.

Madness was already flickering in his eyes.

Had Lee Gwak not called him, he would have attacked Yook Cheon-ban by now. Cheol Gwang Woo was exerting superhuman patience.

Yook Cheon-ban smirked at Cheol Gwang Woo’s restraint.

“What’s this? You’re as big as a bear but as cowardly as a mouse. Are you still watching out for your brother’s cues at your age, bear?”

Lee Gwak stepped in front of Cheol Gwang Woo, about to retort, and spoke. Then, Yook Cheon-ban’s eyes sparkled.

“Ha! They say if you beat a dog, its master will appear, and now the bear’s master has shown himself.”

“I don’t know what this is about, but let’s stop here and back off.”

“You’re saying I’m picking a fight without reason? I, Yook Cheon-ban, the Iron Half Sword …”

“Is that not the case?”

Lee Gwak’s indifferent reply made Yook Cheon-ban’s eyes sharpen.

“How dare you insult me.”

“I don’t understand how the conversation has turned this way. It’s clear that you’re the one who started the trouble.”

“Hmph! I merely commented because that bear-like fellow was ruining the atmosphere. I don’t see how that’s picking a fight.”

“That’s exactly what picking a fight is. If you blatantly provoke someone and then deny it, everyone watching will laugh at you. I didn’t know the famous Yook Cheon-ban, the Half-Iron Sword, was this foolish.”

Yook Cheon-ban’s expression hardened at Lee Gwak’s words, not anticipating Lee Gwak to be so verbally adept.

The nickname Iron Half Sword was earned during the final stages of the war against the Celestial Demon Troupe, making it a name that carried significant weight and intimidation. People often backed down just from facing him, especially newcomers like Lee Gwak, who had just entered the martial world.

Up until now, most people who faced Yook Cheon-ban showed a subdued demeanor or voluntarily stepped back, especially greenhorns in the Jianghu like Lee Gwak.

They wouldn’t dare to argue against whatever Yook Cheon-ban said, simply nodding along. Thus, Yook Cheon-ban expected the same this time.

However, Lee Gwak responded sharply, contrary to expectations.

His ordinary eyes seemed to pierce right through Yook Cheon-ban, making him uncomfortable. Provoking Cheol Gwang Woo was deliberate, but now Yook Cheon-ban was genuinely upset.

Yook Cheon-ban glanced subtly at Woo Mun Pae.

Woo Mun Pae nodded almost imperceptibly, indicating he would support Yook Cheon-ban no matter what.

“The person you’re having this conversation with is me. I don’t know why you’re looking over there.”

“Do you have your master over there?”

In that moment, the killing intent in Yook Cheon-ban’s eyes deepened.

Lee Gwak was turning his words back on him, implying that Yook Cheon-ban was the dog.

“How dare you!”

Unable to contain himself any longer, Yook Cheon-ban’s killing intent exploded.

His half-broken iron sword, fastened at his waist, was drawn with dazzling speed.

He aimed for Lee Gwak’s mouth.

He wanted to shred that mouth that dared to mock him.

A length of sword qi formed on the broken iron sword.

“That fool…”

Upon seeing this, Gu Ok-rin felt a sense of alarm.

Woo Mun Pae’s instruction to Yook Cheon-ban was to provoke Cheol Gwang Woo into disgrace. Assuming Cheol Gwang Woo was simple-minded, Woo Mun Pae believed he would easily lose his temper, making it easy to discipline him

However, the situation had unexpectedly reversed, with Yook Cheon-ban being provoked by Lee Gwak and making the first move, which was the opposite of the original plan.

If Lee Gwak were to be bloodied and fall now, it would be as if Yook Cheon-ban had directly thrown ashes on Cheongunbi’s feast table. But it was too late for her to intervene.

Gu Ok-rin could only hope that Yook Cheon-ban would not take Lee Gwak’s life, believing somehow the situation could still be salvaged.

A metallic sound erupted.

Gu Ok-rin’s eyes widened in surprise at the scene unfolding before her, which was contrary to what she had anticipated.

Yook Cheon-ban’s sword was being deflected by Lee Gwak’s palm.

Despite the direct clash with the sword qi, Lee Gwak’s hand bore not a single scratch, a sight beyond Gu Ok-rin’s understanding.

Yet, no matter how shocked Gu Ok-rin was, it couldn’t compare to Yook Cheon-ban, the attacker.

Yook Cheon-ban’s eyes shook violently.

Not only was he astonished that his sword qi was repelled by Lee Gwak’s bare hand, but his grip on the sword hilt was torn, bleeding. This implied an immense force behind Lee Gwak’s palm.

“Is that all you can do?”

This time, Lee Gwak provocatively challenged Yook Cheon-ban.

Regardless of Woo Mun Pae’s intentions for targeting him and Cheol Gwang Woo, Lee Gwak could not simply stand by and be victimized.

Lee Gwak knew too well that showing weakness in the Jianghu did not earn one protection but rather invited aggression like wild dogs, resulting in a brutal beating.

Jianghu was neither merciful nor romantic.

It was merely a cruel struggle for survival, glamorously disguised.

To Lee Gwak, the Jianghu was a battlefield where only the survivors could assert their justice. Woo Mun Pae’s motives were now irrelevant.

With many onlookers, showing weakness or retreating would not only tarnish his own honor but also disgrace his master, Gwang Noh-ya.

There was no room for retreat in this battle.

Yook Cheon-ban, shocked by Lee Gwak’s momentum, clenched his teeth.

He had not anticipated such an immense aura from someone who seemed ordinary. But the situation had escalated too far.

Retreating now would mean losing Woo Mun Pae’s trust and becoming a laughingstock among the many witnesses.

Yook Cheon-ban unleashed a furious assault towards Lee Gwak.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!

In an instant, his half-broken iron sword seemed to multiply into ten, attacking Lee Gwak.

Blood Flash Under Heaven.

A lethal move used only against those deemed mortal enemies.

It was the technique that ended the life of the Celestial Demon Troupe’s Jin Gong and earned him the nickname Iron-Half Sword.

Yook Cheon-ban invested all his energy into this attack, amplifying its power.

“Good heavens!”

People on the platform watching the situation stood up in shock.

To their eyes, it seemed like Lee Gwak would be shredded to pieces.

But the illusion shattered, revealing an unbelievable reality.

Lee Gwak’s palm had deflected Yook Cheon-ban’s lethal attack.

The impact left Yook Cheon-ban’s chest wide open, and Lee Gwak didn’t miss the opportunity.

His palm, blooming like a flower, struck Yook Cheon-ban’s chest with full force.

The air exploded as Yook Cheon-ban was hurled backward, flying a distance of five yards before crashing into a wall.

Yook Cheon-ban’s bloodied head drooped down, defeated.
