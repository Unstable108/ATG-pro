Lee Gwak wore a slightly embarrassed expression.

Formalities like this were still unfamiliar to him.

Lim Sobo lifted her head and looked at him.

There was no hint of mischief on her face.

If he had decided to become the leader of a sect, he would have to get used to this kind of atmosphere.

This was the reason why Lim So-bo was being so polite.

‘You have to get used to it. If the person who is to become the leader lacks dignity, the followers will feel uncomfortable. This is the fate of one who seeks to lead.’

Lee Gwak was not born with the destiny of a ruler; he had worked his way up from the bottom, and his way of thinking was fundamentally different from those born to rule.

Lim Sobo liked that about him – but her personal feelings and her duties as the strategist of Mad Martial Sect had to remain separate.

Lee Gwak silently watched Lim So-bo and the people who had followed her.

He sensed her resolve clearly, but accepting it or not was his choice.

Lee Gwak spoke in a low voice.

“It is good to see you all. You must have had a long and difficult journey.”

“Thank you, Sect Leader!”

“Please, come inside so we can talk.”

Lee Gwak treated them as if they were old acquaintances.

Lim So-bo looked slightly surprised.

She had hoped that Lee Gwak would keep a serious face or show some authority to command the former secret court members. But people don’t change that easily.

Especially someone like Lee Gwak who had lived his life with unwavering integrity – his attitude wasn’t something that could be changed overnight.

‘Is that really Lee Gwak?’

‘A martial artist so fearsome he’s called the Sura, yet he seems so ordinary…’

The strategists and martial artists of the Secret Court couldn’t help but marvel as they looked at Lee Gwak.

The Lee Gwak they knew was a fearsome martial artist who stood shoulder to shoulder with the leaders of the seven sects.

Even without any sect backing him, he had walked his own path, and no sect or martial artist in the Jianghu could stop him.

Because of that, they had assumed he would be an intimidating figure—someone who inspired awe and authority, bending others to his will through sheer presence.

But the Lee Gwak they met in person was nothing like they had imagined.

He was gentle yet impeccably polite. And yet, he didn’t seem foolish or reckless.

There was a weight to Lee Gwak—a gravity that couldn’t be hidden no matter how politely he acted.

Because of this, no one here dared to underestimate him.

Instinctively, they realized that Lee Gwak was different from any other supreme martial artist they had ever seen.

One of their biggest concerns in following Im So-bo here was whether Lee Gwak would turn out to be like Ja Hong-cheon, the leader of the Changcheon Alliance—a man consumed by ambition, wielding his authority to crush those beneath him.

Lim So-bo had told them they’d understand once they met him, but up until now, they’d remained half-doubtful.

But the Lee Gwak they saw was a man who was both respectful and carried the weight of a mountain.

Only then did they breathe a sigh of relief, confident that they hadn’t made the wrong choice.

Their steps lightened as they followed Lee Gwak.

Two small children came out to greet the group inside the hall.

“Welcome. We’ve prepared a meal inside.”

“You must have had a long and tiring journey.”

Despite their young age, the two carried themselves with remarkable composure. They were Jo So-hye and Pi Jin-ui, the children Lee Gwak had saved.

Both were now his martial disciples.

Aside from Lee Cheong and Lee Su-ah, they were the first disciples Lee Gwak had accepted.

Jo So-hye and Pi Jin-ui possessed astonishing talent in martial arts. They weren’t prodigies who could grasp ten things after being taught one, but they thoroughly mastered what they were taught and could even expand on it, connecting it to two or three other concepts.

Not only were they talented, but they also had the tenacity to push themselves relentlessly.

Both had lost everything to the Heavenly Fate Sect, leaving only bitterness behind. Lee Gwak took them in as his disciples.

Since the founding of the Mad Martial Sect, he had intended to accept disciples, so accepting them was not a problem.

Jo So-hye and Pi Jin-ui knew exactly how extraordinary Lee Gwak was. When someone of his caliber offered to take them as disciples, there was no reason to hesitate.

In fact, both children had received great kindness from Lee Gwak. In the depths of their hearts, they revered him and swore to follow him with unwavering loyalty until death.

Having heard their story through carrier‑pigeon letters, Lim Sobo approached them without hesitation.

“Nice to meet you all! I’m Lim So-bo. Let’s get along well.”

“Ah! W-we’re the ones who should say that!”

“It’s nice to meet you both. I’m Lim Sobo. Let’s take good care of each other.”

“Ah—y‑yes! We look forward to learning from you.”

Their innocent embarrassment made Lim Sobo smile.

Once everyone entered the main hall, Lee Gwak said, “Please sit and rest.”

Before anyone could, a middle‑aged scholar with sharp features raised his hand.

“I have something to ask the sect leader first.”

A sharp-eyed middle-aged scholar raised his hand.

His name was Cheong Un-san, also known as the Bamboo Master.

He had been a loyal subordinate of Yeo Jung-wol, respecting and following him above all others.

If Yeo Jung-wol laid out grand strategies, Cheong Un-san was the one who meticulously analyzed and implemented them.

His ability to dissect things down to the finest detail was unparalleled – even Yeo Jung-wol acknowledged his superiority in this regard.

Their relationship was like thread and needle—inseparable.

That was why, when Yeo Jung-wol refused to cooperate with Ja Hong-cheon and was imprisoned, Cheong Un-san also abandoned all his duties.

True to his nickname, he was strict and unyielding in character.

When news of Yeo Jung-wol’s death reached him, he reportedly wept for three days and nights—a fact well known throughout the Secret Court.

The reason he left Jade Heaven Alliance and came here wasn’t solely due to Lim So-bo’s persuasion.

He had long been deeply interested in Lee Gwak.

He wanted to see Lee Gwak in person and judge for himself.

His judgment would determine the future course of the Secret Court members who had come with him.

As if reflecting his thoughts, his gaze at Lee Gwak was as sharp as a blade.

“Ask whatever you wish.”

“Thank you. I’m curious to know what the sect leader’s goals are for leading the Mad Martial Sect. It’s not just my question, but a question shared by everyone here.”

“To be honest, I don’t know anything.”

“Huh?”

Lee Gwak’s answer left Cheong Un-san and the others dumbfounded.

They had expected him to at least declare some grand ambition, especially in a gathering like this.

After all, as the leader of a martial sect and someone aiming to end an age of chaos,

it was common sense – at least according to their understanding – for such a person to exaggerate and project authority, even if only to rally followers.

But Lee Gwak’s answer defied all their expectations.

His calm voice continued.

“I’ve never studied the art of rulership, nor do I harbor ambitions of becoming the supreme leader of the Jianghu. As many of you may know, I started my life in the Jianghu as a low-ranking outer hall martial artist of the Jade Heaven Alliance. Every day was a struggle just to survive, and I never even considered nurturing grand ambitions. The only thing I could do was my best to survive in the circumstances given to me.”

“……”

“That’s how I lived, day by day. By luck, I met a great master and received excellent teachings. I also formed bonds with many good people. Over time, I gained considerable fame, but the most important thing to me—shamefully—was my own peace. That’s why I lived in seclusion with my family, far removed from the Jianghu. To be honest, I still miss that life sometimes.”

“Then why did you return to the Jianghu? If your own peace was most important.”

“Good question. I’d like to know myself.”

“Sect Leader!”

“What does Heaven want from me that it has brought me to this position? I don’t know. But I feel that I must do something. Lately, I’ve begun to vaguely realize how great a sin it is to possess power yet take no action for the world.”

Even now, when he closed his eyes, the scenes of suffering he had witnessed flashed vividly in his mind.

Jianghu’s righteousness had hit rock bottom, and countless people were caught in its bloody conflicts, enduring agony.

Pi Jin-ui and Jo So-hye, whom he had taken as disciples, were prime examples.

“I felt I had to do something. But I don’t know where to start. That’s why I’ve troubled all of you to come here. Please, tell me. What must I do to bring even a little peace to the Jianghu? To bring even a little comfort to those who suffer?”

Lee Gwak’s voice remained calm.

He didn’t speak forcefully. But his sincerity was unmistakable.

One of the greatest martial artists in the world was earnestly asking for their help. No one had ever spoken to the strategists and martial artists of the Secret Court like this before.

Cheong Un-san’s eyes wavered.

Lee Gwak’s plain words had shaken him to the core.

The others felt the same.

“Please, guide me onto the right path.”

“Are you saying you’ll lead the Mad Martial Sect as we advise?”

“If that is the right path…”

“And who decides what is right or wrong?”

“My heart will know. And so will yours.”

“Hah! You really are a dreamer. For the leader of a newly founded sect to be this soft…”

Cheong Un-san clicked his tongue.

On the surface, it sounded like criticism of Lee Gwak’s indecisiveness, but that wasn’t the case.

A faint smile had already appeared at the corners of his lips.

Those who knew him were startled.

It was rare for Cheong Un-san to show emotion so openly in public.

Lee Gwak was a completely new kind of person—one he had never encountered before. Working with someone like this would be a challenge, even for him.

“…But it might not be so bad.”

The small smile on his lips had already spread across his entire face.

“We won’t have to worry about funds for a while.”

Lim So-bo and Cheong Un-san marveled at the warehouse filled to the brim with wealth.

Lee Gwak had tried to return the riches plundered by the Heavenly Fates Sect to their original owners. But many of those who should have reclaimed their belongings had either died or disappeared without a trace.

Because of that, the warehouse still held a vast amount of unclaimed wealth.

“Hah… It’s said that when evil cults rise, the world suffers. At least Sect Leader cut them down before things got worse. If they had been left unchecked, even more people would have suffered.”

A shadow crossed Cheong Un-san’s face.

The wealth accumulated here was stained with the blood and tears of countless people. Therefore, it couldn’t be spent carelessly.

Lim So-bo turned to him.

“Until we find someone suitable to manage the finances, please oversee the warehouse, Bamboo Master.”

“Understood.”

“We have a lot of work ahead. From establishing the sect’s structure to recruiting disciples—we’ll have to handle everything.”

“The road ahead is quite arduous.”

“At least we aren’t starting from nothing. We have ample funds, and above all, Oraboni’s reputation and connections are formidable.”

“That’s true…”

Cheong Un-san nodded.

After pledging loyalty to Lee Gwak, the thing that surprised him the most was the sheer breadth of his influence.

Though Lee Gwak himself paid no attention to it, those he had helped or formed bonds with were scattered throughout the martial world.

There were many with formidable martial skills, but few who also possessed such immense prestige.

Prestige was an invisible asset—a supporting force. Though it might seem insignificant now, it would become a solid foundation when the time came to rise higher.

Since ancient times, those who founded great sects or brought order to chaotic eras all possessed extraordinary prestige.

Lee Gwak already met that minimum requirement.

For a military advisor building a new sect from the ground up, this was an invaluable asset.

Cheong Un-san asked Lim So-bo,

“So where do we begin?”

“First, we need to find and recruit the survivors of the Zealous Justice Clan. Though the sect was annihilated by the Jade Heaven Alliance, some must have gone into hiding. We’ll bring them in to establish legitimacy.”

“And then?”

“We’ll need to gather talent. A small sect like ours must build its strength while remaining hidden. In the long term, Oraboni will have to train disciples, but until then, we’ll rely on external recruits to lay the foundation.”

“In these chaotic times, there’s no shortage of martial artists who’ve lost their homes and wander the world. We’ll need to sift through them. Fortunately, Sect Leader’s reputation is great, so recruiting them shouldn’t be too difficult.”

“Who would be suitable for the task?”

“Jang Myeong is gentle and treats people sincerely. He’d be best suited for recruitment.”

“Then let’s appoint Jang Sa-hyung as the head of recruitment.”

“Agreed.”

“We can obtain information from the Hao Clan, so we can skip that. Next, we’ll need to find a merchant group to supply necessary goods.”

“Hwang Pyeong handled similar matters in the Secret Court. He’s the right man for the job.”

“Good. Then ask Hwang Sa-hyung to seek out merchant groups. For now, we’ll rely on external ones, but in the long run, we’ll need to establish our own.”

“Hwang Pyeong will handle it well. If he hadn’t joined the secret court, he would’ve become a great merchant.”

“Oppa has connections with quite a few merchant groups and escort agencies. Have him prioritize contacting them.”

“I’ll take care of it.”

“And…”

Their discussion continued for a long time.

On the land where the Zealous Justice Clan had fallen, the Mad Martial Sect had begun to rise.
