Woo Mun Pae’s eyes gleamed with killing intent.

It was because the face he had never forgotten had appeared before him.

The man who had handed him his only defeat stood there.

Lee Gwak!

The absolute martial artist known as Sura Blade.

When they first met in Haenam, Lee Gwak did not even register in his mind. However, their clash at Master Cheongunbi’s birthday celebration changed everything and marked Woo Mun Pae’s first defeat.

The shameful memory of that time still haunted him.

He glared at Lee Gwak with killing intent.

However, Lee Gwak’s expression was not as fierce or intense as Woo Mun Pae’s. He looked ordinary, like someone you could see anywhere, yet his presence felt powerful.

A solid will that would not bend under any pressure or force.

Woo Mun Pae’s eyebrows twitched.

He instinctively sensed that Lee Gwak had reached even greater heights than before.

He could tell simply from the way Lee Gwak had intervened earlier and effortlessly deflected his strike.

At that moment, Lee Gwak opened his mouth.

“It seems there’s a misunderstanding. Wouldn’t it be better to stop this before it escalates?”

“Still so arrogant. Just because you won once, do you think you stand above everyone? A misunderstanding? Misunderstanding? How dare you interfere with the Martial Sword Troupe?”

Lee Gwak fell silent.

A tremendous killing intent flickered in Woo Mun Pae’s eyes.

He didn’t care about explanations or excuses. The only thing that mattered was that Lee Gwak was standing right in front of him.

“Hoo!”

Lee Gwak let out a soft sigh.

He was reminded once again how difficult it was to shake off entanglements in the Jianghu.

No matter what Lee Gwak said or what excuses he made, Woo Mun Pae would not hear them.

What mattered to him was avenging his defeat to restore his reputation.

“Sura blade… Lee Gwak!”

Woo Mun-pae gritted his teeth.

Although he remained on Haenam, he never missed a single piece of news from the Jianghu.

Among the rumors, the ones about Lee Gwak, the Sura Blade, were the most frequent.

His reputation now matched, if not exceeded, that of the Eight Great Martial Artists and even the Seven Masters.

Woo Mun Pae, as one of the Ten Lesser Skies, had a formidable reputation, but it could not compare to Lee Gwak’s.

The fact that Lee Gwak’s platform of fame was built upon a victory against him stung even more.

If he had been the victor back then, perhaps the fame Lee Gwak enjoyed would have been his.

That thought made him even more furious.

He wanted to cut down Lee Gwak right there and then, but Lee Gwak’s presence was too significant.

His fame and martial prowess had already surpassed his own.

In the last ten years, no martial artist with a higher reputation than him had emerged; such was the excellence of his martial arts, and confronting him head-on was too much of a burden for Woo Mun Pae.

In the Jianghu, reputation was power.

Lee Gwak’s strength was undeniably on par with Woo Mun Pae’s.

Woo Mun Pae did not want to shoulder such a burden recklessly.

If he acted rashly and lost again, it would be the end for him – he would never recover. He had to be careful.

He had only one chance. It would not be wasted.

“Hoo!”

With a sigh, Woo Mun Pae withdrew the aura he had gathered. The oppressive force that had weighed on the surroundings vanished without a trace.

Feigning magnanimity, he spoke.

“Tell me. What was this misunderstanding?”

Calmly, Lee Gwak recounted the events of a few moments ago.

After listening to the whole story, Woo Mun Pae glared at Ok Cheon Hwa, annoyed by the whole ordeal. Startled, Ok Cheon Hwa waved his hands in protest.

“I really had no such intention. I just wanted to help the Martial Sword Troupe…”

.

“Enough, you’re confined for a while.”

“Understood…”

Ok Cheon-hwa gave up on making excuses and bowed his head.

He realized that making further excuses would only make his situation more pathetic.

With his head bowed, he glanced at Cheol Gwang Woo.

‘All because of that oaf…’

His eyes brimmed with venom. Even though he bowed his head, it didn’t mean that he admitted his guilt.

He was quietly chewing on his grudge against Cheol Gwang Woo.

Meanwhile, Woo Mun Pae didn’t even look at Ok Cheon Hwa.

Normally he would have tried to calm him down, but not today.

Today, someone much more important was standing in front of him.

He turned back to Lee Gwak and spoke.

“Let’s have a drink.”

Woo Mun Pae had always been selective about the people he associated with.

He was cold to those he deemed unworthy, barely giving them a glance. But this time was different.

It was an age of chaos.

Even one more powerful martial artist at his side or in his sphere of influence could greatly benefit the Martial Sword Troupe.

And Lee Gwak was no ordinary martial artist.

In just a few short years, he had accomplished feats that Woo Mun Pae himself had thought impossible.

That was why Woo Mun Pae chose to befriend him rather than become his enemy.

Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

He remembered the words of an old sage.

If he could embrace the one who had defeated him, his own reputation would only grow.

If he could accept the man who had defeated him, his own reputation would only grow.

Woo Mun Pae looked at Lee Gwak with intense eyes. He didn’t even consider the possibility that Lee Gwak might refuse. And as expected, Lee Gwak didn’t refuse.

“Very well.”

As they would inevitably clash while in Taegang, it would be more beneficial to confront him early and understand the intentions of Martial Sword Troupe.

“I heard there’s a decent drinking house by the riverside. Let’s head there.”

“Sounds good.”

Lee Gwak nodded, and the two headed toward the riverside tavern.

Nine Heavens Tower.

That was the name of the opulent drinking house by the river.

The Nine Heavens Tower was made up of four floors, the first floor was accessible to the general public. However, from the third floor upwards, entry was strictly regulated based on status.

The third floor was reserved for the children of high-ranking officials or disciples of renowned martial artists, while the fourth floor was only accessible to a select few among them.

Of course, Woo Mun Pae had the qualifications to enter the fourth floor. Thanks to this, Lee Gwak was also able to ascend to the fourth floor without any restrictions.

The tavern’s judgement was that anyone accompanying Woo Mun Pae was undoubtedly a distinguished guest, so there was no need for further questioning.

“Let’s sit here.”

Woo Mun Pae chose a seat by the window where the panoramic view of Taegang was clearly visible.

The owner of Nine Heavens Tower came personally to take their order. This alone showed how highly regarded Woo Mun Pae was as a guest.

Naturally, Lee Gwak was also treated with utmost respect.

The round table was soon filled with an array of rare delicacies.

Until then, Lee Gwak and Woo Mun Pae had been observing each other in silence.

Surprisingly, it was Woo Mun Pae who broke the suffocating silence.

He poured wine into Lee Gwak’s cup and then filled his own to the brim.

“Let’s Drink.”

“Yes.”

Both men raised their cups.

They lightly clinked their cups and drank.

Woo Mun Pae had a high tolerance for alcohol. Despite the early hour, he downed five cups in quick succession, seemingly quenching his thirst.

Lee Gwak, on the other hand, drank only one cup before putting it down.

It was too early in the day, but more importantly, the wine at Nine Heavens Tower paled in comparison to the brew Cheol Daesan had given him the day before.

The food was the same.

Although the table was laden with exquisite dishes, they could not compare to the simple meal Bang Ye-in had prepared for him the night before.

Lee Gwak grumbled inwardly that his standards for food and drink had become too high.

But that was only for a moment; soon after, he looked at Woo Mun Pae with a calm gaze.

Woo Mun Pae had also set down his wine glass and was looking at Lee Gwak.

Out of nowhere, he asked, “We first met in Haenam, didn’t we?”

Lee Gwak paused and looked at Woo Mun Pae .

They had actually met much earlier at Jae Heaven Alliance, but at that time, Lee Gwak had been so inconspicuous that Woo Mun Pae didn’t remember him.

Not wanting to dredge up those memories, Lee Gwak simply nodded.

“Yes.”

“You’ve grown a lot. Back then, I thought you were just a nobody, but now…”

Woo Mun Pae trailed off.

He didn’t want to speak of what had happened next.

Thinking back, a lot has occurred since then.

The Haemu Festival had taken place, and Ok Cheon Hwa had won the final duel, earning the title of Young Hero of the South Sea.

And then that incident occurred.

The destruction of the Nine Shadows Fleet

.

The Nine Shadows Fleet had been operated by Woo Mun Pae’s uncle, Goong Ji-shim, under the orders of the Martial Sword Troupe’s leader, Yu Moon-sang. The fleet had contributed greatly to the alliance’s growth and had been a cornerstone of its prosperity.

The destruction of the Nine Shadows Fleet had a significant impact on the alliance. Because of this, Woo Mun Pae had been too busy handling the aftermath to focus on anything else.

Woo Mun Pae stared intently at Lee Gwak.

A thought occurred to him.

It was too much of a coincidence that the Nine Shadows Fleet had been annihilated just when Lee Gwak had appeared.

‘Was it really just a coincidence?’

A seed of doubt sprouted in his mind.

Woo Mun Pae feigned nonchalance and asked, “Why did you come to Haenam back then?”

“I was passing through. The ship I was on was attacked by the Nine Shadows Fleet near Haenam, so we needed a place to repair. That’s why I stayed in Haenam for a few days.”

“Is that so?”

There was nothing suspicious about Lee Gwak’s answer.

After all, it was true that the ship attacked by the Nine Shadows Fleet had docked in Haenam.

Woo Mun Pae couldn’t know the finer details at this point.

For a moment, Woo Mun Pae stared piercingly at Lee Gwak.

‘Should I kill him? Or fight him?’

Dozens of conflicting thoughts raced through his mind in an instant.

But once again, he suppressed his killing intent with superhuman patience.

Woo Mun Pae forced a calm expression and said, “I’ll cut to the chase. Join the Martial Sword Troupe. I’ll promise you a position second only to me.”

“Second only to you?”

“Yes! Once this matter is successfully concluded, I will become the supreme leader of the Martial Sword Troupe. When that happens, no one will be able to question my decisions. As the leader, I will grant you the highest position in the alliance.”

“That’s interesting.”

Lee Gwak crossed his arms and leaned back into his chair.

“Being the second-in-command of the Martial Sword Troupe would place you among the top five most powerful figures in Jianghu. No matter how much fame you’ve gained in Jianghu, there’s a limit to what you can achieve alone. But once you join the alliance, those limits will disappear.”

“But the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Celestial Demon Troupe are still strong. Can you be so sure? Not that I’m saying the Martial Sword Troupe is inferior to them.”

“Hmph! If you didn’t know anything, you’d think that. But soon, the order of Jianghu will change. The existing order will crumble and a new power will rise.”

“……”

“The world is changing, and at its centre will be me and the Martial Sword Troupe. If you follow me, you’ll naturally be at the centre of the world. What do you say?”

Woo Mun Pae’s eyes burned as he looked at Lee Gwak. His gaze was so intense that an ordinary person’s eyes might have burned just from meeting it.

His eyes were filled with great ambition.

Lee Gwak could see the confidence in Woo Mun Pae’s eyes.

Isn’t he bluffing?

If someone else had said that, Lee Gwak would have dismissed it as nonsense. But Woo Mun Pae was already a man of considerable power and influence. It was hard to believe that such a man would speak so confidently without some truth in his words.

“What are you going to do?”

“The offer is interesting, but it’s not something I can decide lightly. May I have some time to think it over?”

Woo Mun Pae’s jaw twitched at Lee Gwak’s calm reply. He wasn’t stupid enough to miss the refusal in Lee Gwak’s words.

Woo Mun Pae’s gaze turned cold.

Despite all his efforts, Lee Gwak had the audacity to refuse.

Controlling his rising anger, Woo Mun Pae spoke.

“Fine. I’ll give you time.

But I can’t wait long. I’ll give you five days. After that, even if you want to listen, you won’t get the chance.”

He set a firm deadline of five days.

Lee Gwak’s brow furrowed slightly.

Does he mean the world will change in five days?

That was how confident Woo Mun Pae sounded to Lee Gwak’s ears.

Woo Mun Pae emphasised once more, “Don’t forget. Only five days.

“Understood. I’ll give you my answer before then.”

There was no reason to stay any longer.

Lee Gwak left the table full of food and stood up. He bowed to Woo Mun Pae and descended the stairs.

Alone, Woo Mun Pae picked up his wine cup.

At that moment, a gray shadow appeared before him like a ghost.

Woo Mun Pae wasn’t startled.

The man in gray was Yeon Ho-gyeong, the leader of the Sea Sword Squad, the personal guard of the Martial Sword Alliance’s leader, Yu Moon-sang.

Until now, Yeon Ho-gyeong had never left Yu Moon-sang’s side. The fact that he had followed Woo Mun Pae showed just how significant this matter was.

Woo Mun Pae offered Yeon Ho-gyeong a cup and said, “Care for a drink, Leader Yeon?”

“It’s him.”

“What?”

“He’s the one responsible for the annihilation of the Nine Shadows Fleet.”

“Is that true?”

Woo Mun Pae’s eyes widened as he looked at Yeon Ho-gyeong.

He had suspected as much, but hearing it from Yeon Ho-gyeong’s lips was more shocking than he had imagined.

If it became known that Yu Moon-sang had ordered his disciple, Goong Ji-shim, to operate the Nine Shadows Fleet, the alliance’s reputation would be ruined, and no one would follow them.

That’s why Yu Moon-sang had even forbidden his own disciple, Woo Mun Pae, from getting involved with the fleet. It was his way of ensuring that no dirt would stick to Woo Mun Pae later.

Crash!

The wine cup in Woo Mun Pae’s hand shattered.

Wine soaked his hand, but Woo Mun Pae didn’t care.

“I made a pointless offer.”

If Lee Gwak was truly responsible for the annihilation of the Nine Shadows Fleet

, then they could not coexist under the same sky.

Though it was only in name, Goong Ji-shim was like a martial uncle to him.

Woo Mun Pae shook the wine off his hand and said, “Add him to the elimination list.”

“It will be my pleasure.”
