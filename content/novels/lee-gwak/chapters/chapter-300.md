The gates of the Nine Dragons Clan swung wide open.

The first to rush in were the martial artists who had come to attend the martial arts tournament.

In front of the main gate, martial artists of the Nine Dragons Clan were verifying the identities of those who had come to participate in the tournament.

“I’m Jo Gwang-ho of the Jo Family Manor. I’ve come to participate in the tournament.”

“I’m Gu Jang-yeon from Sinmyeong County. My master is…”

The identity checks were thorough.

Anyone whose identity was even slightly questionable were not allowed in at all. Already, more than a hundred people had turned away without even getting a glimpse inside the Nine Dragons Clan.

Given the circumstances, those with weak martial skills or without a notable sect didn’t even dare to approach the gates.

A young man in his late twenties leaned against the wall of the Nine Dragons Clan, watching people being inspected.

With fairly handsome features, a tall stature, and an expressive face, he chewed on a foxtail grass as he watched the people being screened.

Despite his somewhat rude appearance, none of the martial artists of the Nine Dragons Clan said anything to him.

The Nine Dragons Clan was composed of four main halls:

The Sky Dragon Hall was a martial force symbolizing the Nine Dragons Clan, composed of masters possessing formidable martial prowess.

The Hidden Dragon Hall was an organization that gathered external intelligence, similar in nature to the Hao Clan or the Heavenly Intelligence Hall of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

The Yellow Dragon Hall oversaw the external military forces, while the Cloud Dragon Hall was responsible for internal affairs.

The young man was the head of the Cloud Dragon Hall.

His name was Go Il-young, and his nickname was Demon Soul Ghost Sword.

Though young, Go Il-young commanded the Cloud Dragon Hall with his exceptional martial arts, and beast-like sharp instincts.

His personality was free-spirited, but once he drew his sword, he rampaged like a demon. Because of that, he was feared even within the Nine Dragons Clan.

Go Il-young gazed sharply at the main gate.

At a glance, it seemed like he was idly wasting time, but in reality, his role was to filter out suspicious martial artists that the gate guards might miss.

Already, hundreds of martial artists had entered the Nine Dragons Clan, but none particularly caught Go Il-young’s eye, so he was bored.

He chewed the foxtail grass to bits and turned to powder.

“Ugh! Ptooey!”

Feeling the bitter taste in his mouth, Go Il-young spat out the foxtail grass along with his saliva. The greenish saliva stretched across his lips.

“Damn it!”

As Go Il-young wiped the drooling spit with his sleeve, an ordinary-looking father and son appeared at the main gate of the Nine Dragons Clan.

The father and son walking hand in hand were none other than Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong.

The two stood at the end of the long line, waiting their turn.

The sight of the two chatting amicably drew Go Il-young’s attention.

“How nice.”

The father looked at his son with loving eyes and the son smiled back at his father.

They were a father and son who looked close to anyone’s eyes. Seeing such a pair, Go Il-young’s gaze turned cold.

“It makes me want to break them for no reason.”

Perhaps because he hadn’t received his father’s love and had to endure harsh times alone in his childhood, he felt an unreasonable envy when he saw such a harmonious relationship between the father and son.

“No, I must restrain myself. This is not the time.”

Go Il-young suppressed his desires with effort.

Although he usually acted as he pleased, he knew how to distinguish between public and private matters.

Now was not the time to act on whims.

The martial arts tournament starting today was an important event to display the might of the Nine Dragons Clan to the world. If he ruined such an event because of his mood, the sect Master, Gyeong Un-cheon, would not stand for it.

Go Il-young, who feared nothing under the heavens, respected and feared Gyeong Un-cheon immensely.

Gyeong Un-cheon was the most terrifying person he had ever met. Though he had never seen Ja Hong-cheon, the leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance, he didn’t think he could be greater than Gyeong Un-cheon.

Go Il-young picked another foxtail grass and put it in his mouth, then looked at Lee Gwak and his son.

No matter how he looked, they seemed ordinary. Yet, strangely, he couldn’t take his eyes off them. His gaze followed Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong.

Meanwhile, Lee Gwak and his son’s turn came.

A martial artist of the Nine Dragons Clan scrutinized Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong from head to toe with sharp eyes.

“State your identities.”

“I’m Lee Jin-mun. This child is my son, Lee Cheong.”

“Which sect do you belong to?”

“We don’t belong to any sect in particular. We’ve just learned a few martial arts passed down in our family.”

“Huh! No sect? Then it’s difficult to let you in. Only those with verified identities can enter the sect.”

“There’s someone inside who can verify my identity.”

“Who is that?”

“Master Nam Woo-chang, the chief of the Unsan Escort Agency, and Head Escort Go Chang-seon. They can vouch for me.”

“Really?”

Those two were currently esteemed guests staying inside the Nine Dragons Clan. If they vouched for his identity, it was acceptable to let them in.

“If you’re lying, you’ll be held responsible. Is that okay?”

“Yes!”

“Wait here. We will send someone to confirm your story.”

Lee Gwak nodded and stepped aside with Lee Cheong to wait. One of the martial artists guarding the gate ran inside to confirm Lee Gwak’s words.

While Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong waited, the identity checks for others continued. The two spent a tedious time watching the scene.

After a while, two people emerged from inside the gate.

One was the martial artist who had gone to verify their identity, and the other was Go Chang-seon, the Head Escort of the Unsan Escort Agency.

“So it really was you.”

“Head Escort Go.”

“What’s going on?”

“I came to have my son participate in the martial arts tournament.”

“I thought so.”

Go Chang-seon nodded without a hint of suspicion.

Even without this, the entire Nine Dragons Clan was bustling because of the tournament. As an esteemed guest, Go Chang-seon was well aware of the tournament’s significance.

Go Chang-seon spoke to the martial artists guarding the gate.

“I and the Unsan Escort Agency guarantee this man’s identity.”

“If Master Go says so… Very well! Please write your names in the guestbook and on the tournament entry list, then proceed inside.”

Lee Gwak nodded and signed a pseudonym in the guestbook. Then he wrote Lee Cheong’s name on the tournament entry list.

Lee Cheong’s face flushed red.

He had steeled himself, but now there was no turning back.

Lee Cheong tried hard to calm his pounding heart.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong followed Go Chang-seon into the Nine Dragons Clan.

The interior of the Nine Dragons Clan was far more imposing than it appeared from outside. The ochre-colored walls, unique to the sect, exuded an imposing presence that set it apart from the likes of the Jade Heaven Alliance or the White Light Sect.

As he guided them, Go Chang-seon spoke.

“Those participating in the tournament all stay in the guesthouse. They cram five or six people into one room, so it’s quite crowded. It might not be a good environment for you and your son.”

“It’s alright.”

“How can we do that to a benefactor of the Unsan Escort Agency? We’ll give you one of the rooms assigned to us.”

Currently, the Unsan Escort Agency was staying as esteemed guests of the Nine Dragons Clan. Naturally, they were provided with top-notch accommodations, which were on a different level from the shabby guest houses given to the martial artists who came for the tournament.

“Is that alright?”

“The Chief has instructed us to take special care of you. So don’t worry.”

“Then I’ll gratefully accept your kindness.”

“Wise decision.”

Go Chang-seon smiled.

The room he gave to Lee Gwak was very clean and well-organized. It wasn’t that spacious, but more than sufficient for two people to stay.

Go Chang-seon’s gaze turned to Lee Cheong.

“Since you’re participating in the tournament, I hope you achieve good results.”

“I’ll do my best.”

“You little rascal!”

Go Chang-seon smiled.

Having observed Lee Cheong’s upright character on the way here, he had grown fond of him.

Initially, he had intended to use Lee Gwak, but now he had completely abandoned that idea. One of the reasons was precisely Lee Cheong.

“By the way, the Chief’s nephew, Jin-woon, is also participating in this tournament.”

“Really?”

“Even though his admission is already confirmed, he wants to win the tournament to raise his own value.”

Go Chang-seon sighed softly.

The Nine Dragons Clan’s martial arts tournament was divided into three categories: Heaven, Earth, and Human.

The Heaven-level tournament had no age or status restrictions. Any warrior could participate, so the fiercest battles were expected.

The Earth-level tournament was limited to those in their twenties. Only the most prominent talents in the region participated. Winning this tournament would ensure making a strong impression on the Nine Dragons Clan.

Lastly, the Human-level tournament was restricted to those up to fifteen years old. Only young boys and girls could participate.

Nam Jin-woon intended to participate in the Human-level tournament. At fifteen years old, he barely met the age limit.

Normally, at his age, one might consider participating in the Earth-level tournament, but Nam Jin-woon chose the Human-level tournament.

His thought was to dominate the children participants and stand out.

Go Chang-seon advised him to participate in the Earth-level tournament instead. Even if he lost to older martial artists, it wouldn’t hurt his reputation.

However, the Human-level tournament was different.

If he lost to boys and girls much younger than himself, he would be ridiculed for a long time. Nevertheless, Nam Jin-woon didn’t relent.

Sigh! If that boy focused on martial arts even half as much as Cheong does, I wouldn’t have to worry like this.

Having seen how Lee Cheong trained on the way here, his regret was even greater.

“Anyway, I hope you achieve good results.”

“Thank you.”

Lee Cheong bowed his head politely.

Go Chang-seon waved to Lee Gwak and said, “Then I’ll take my leave. Take care.”

“Thank you for your consideration.”

“Before you leave, please meet with the Chief.”

Chief Nam Woo-chang still hadn’t given up on recruiting Lee Gwak. The current hospitality was, in fact, because of that.

“Understood. I’ll find time to meet him.”

“Thank you.”

Go Chang-seon walked away with swinging strides.

His figure soon disappeared, leaving only Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong in front of the room.

Lee Gwak spoke to Lee Cheong, “First, let’s take a look around the Nine Dragons Clan.”

“Yes!”

Participants in the tournament were granted the right to freely roam the outer court of the Nine Dragons Clan.

This was possible because the main court and facilities were all within the inner court.

The two strolled around the Nine Dragons Clan.

‘It’s similar to the Jade Heaven Alliance.’

The interior of the Nine Dragons Clan was astonishingly similar to the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Since the Jade Heaven Alliance had established itself first, perhaps the Nine Dragons Clan, as the later, had imitated it. There were many similarities between the two. Thanks to that, Lee Gwak could familiarize himself with the layout of the Nine Dragons Clan without much difficulty.

They circled the outer court once, but there was no place where Nam Woo-gyeong might be held.

Are they holding him in the inner court?

Lee Gwak believed that Nam Woo-gyeong was still alive.

Nam Woo-gyeong was the young master of the Hao Clan.

The moment they killed him, they would make an enemy of the entire Hao Clan. There were few entities as troublesome as the Hao Clan to have as enemies.

No matter how great the Nine Dragons Clan’s intelligence network was, once the Hao Clan intervened, they wouldn’t be able to gather any quality information.

The moment they fell behind in the information war, the scales would quickly tip in favor of the Jade Heaven Alliance. It was the worst-case scenario the Nine Dragons Clan could imagine. So they would try to persuade Nam Woo-gyeong to bring him to their side somehow.

That’s how important Nam Woo-gyeong was.

“Brother!”

Lee Gwak gazed at the inner wall of the Nine Dragons Clan.

The wall alone was over nine meters high. Guards were densely stationed atop the wall, glaring down and monitoring below.

Had they relied on formations or mechanisms, there might have been a greater chance to infiltrate secretly, since Lee Gwak was well-versed in formations. But with such extensive human surveillance, even Lee Gwak could do nothing.

Entering the inner court while evading their watch was nearly impossible. However, they would soon open the gate to the inner court themselves.

Because the martial arts tournament would be held in the Grand Training Hall inside the inner court.

After taking another look at the inner wall, Lee Gwak moved on.

In anticipation of the tournament, the Nine Dragons Clan had set up a large market inside the outer court. They opened a night market with food and alcohol to heighten the excitement before the tournament.

“Ha ha ha!”

“Drink up!”

Even though it was still daylight, people were drinking merrily in the market.

Almost every table and chair set up in the night market was occupied, leaving few spots to rest.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong looked around inside the market.

There were hardly any empty seats at the tables and chairs laid out in the night market.

As Lee Gwak wore a troubled expression, a tall young man gestured toward him.

“If you’re looking for empty seats, come over here.”

There were two empty chairs at the table where he was sitting.

Without hesitation, Lee Gwak approached the seat the young man offered.

“Thank you. Let’s sit here.”

“Yes!”

When the two sat down, the young man spoke.

“Since we’re sharing a table, let’s introduce ourselves. Nice to meet you. I’m Go Il-young.”

Go Il-young smiled slyly as he looked at Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong.
