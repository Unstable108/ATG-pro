Lee Gwak spoke once more.

“I am not seeking anything from the Thousand Kingdom School.”

“Is that truly so?”

“Yes, it is.”

“Hard to believe. Even amidst a war with the Jade Heaven Alliance, the Thousand Kingdom School’s power could bring you great wealth and honor. And yet, you refuse?”

“Uncle! Why are you doing this?”

Unable to stand it any longer, Namgung Jin intervened. He felt his uncle’s actions were overly rude—behavior unbefitting of a benefactor of the Thousand Kingdom School.

Despite Namgung Jin’s attempts to stop him, Namgung Hoe remained adamant.

“Can’t you see I am speaking here? Step aside for now.”

“Uncle?”

“Now, go!”

Faced with Namgung Hoe’s firm tone, Namgung Jin had no choice but to back down.

Namgung Hoe’s gaze returned to Lee Gwak.

“If you desire anything, speak freely. I will grant it.”

“May I ask why you’re doing this?”

“That’s not for you to know. Just say what you want. As long as it’s not dishonorable, I’ll make it happen. My offer isn’t a bad deal for you.”

“Are you afraid I’ll make an unreasonable demand from Namgung Jin?”

“….”

“I see.”

Namgung Jin was destined to be the next leader of the Thousand Kingdom School, a position with the authority to command thousands with a single word. The person in this role must be able to issue orders with unflinching resolve, even if it meant sending subordinates to their deaths. For this reason, he had to possess the utmost judgment and reason.

Namgung Hoe worried that if Namgung Jin felt indebted to someone, he would not be able to make the necessary ruthless decisions.

That’s why he was, in effect, forcing Lee Gwak to repay the favor immediately.

He intended to preemptively block the possibility of Lee Gwak making unreasonable demands on Namgung Jin in the future to repay the debt.

Lee Gwak looked at Namgung Hoe with deeply sunken eyes. Although Lee Gwak’s gaze was unsettling, Namgung Hoe maintained a brazen expression.

He didn’t care if his dignity was slightly damaged. The important thing was to sever the bond of gratitude between Lee Gwak and Namgung Jin here.

“Go ahead and say it. Whatever you want, I’ll grant it.”

“Sigh!”

“Do you perhaps not trust my words?”

“No.”

“Then please, go ahead and speak.”

“In that case, please give me a useful elixir, if you have one.”

“An elixir? Do you intend to give it to that child?”

“Yes!”

“Then I’ll give you the White Spirit Divine Pill. It’s an elixir that only the direct descendants of our sect can consume, and it will enhance one’s internal energy by tens of years.”

“Thank you.”

“Then, your bond with our young master ends with the White Spirit Divine Pill?”

“Yes! I’ll do so.”

Lee Gwak might have felt upset, but he answered calmly.

Only then did a smile appear on Namgung Hoe’s face.

““I hope you don’t feel too offended by this old man’s lack of manners. As one grows old, one tends to be more worried and fuss over even trivial matters.”

“I understand.”

“Thank you for saying so.”

Namgung Hoe nodded his head.

As Namgung Jin watched Namgung Hoe’s back, a deep shadow fell over his face.

He was displeased that Namgung Hoe had stepped in and arbitrarily handled the relationship with Lee Gwak.

He understood Namgung Hoe’s feelings, but he thought it wasn’t necessary for him to intervene. However, as Namgung Hoe was so resolute, Namgung Jin missed the chance to step in.

“Brother.”

Namgung Yeon-hwa looked at Namgung Jin with a sympathetic gaze.

To an outsider, it might seem that Namgung Jin enjoyed immense power as the master of the Thousand Kingdom School, but he had many unseen restrictions.

In many ways, he had to be even more careful than ordinary people. Sometimes she even felt sorry for him.

At that moment, Namgung Hoe’s gaze turned toward Lee Cheong, who was beside Lee Gwak.

He had been practicing the Eight Sects Sword Art until a moment ago, so his breathing was quite rough. His stamina was still lacking. Nevertheless, Lee Cheong’s face was filled with joy.

Just the fact that he could learn martial arts from his most beloved and respected father allowed him to endure any hardship.

After seeing his father display the Eight Sects Sword Art against the martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance, he was completely fascinated by it.

He had witnessed with his own eyes that the concise sword technique he was learning possessed such immense power, so he became confident that he could become like that too.

As Namgung Hoe carefully examined Lee Cheong, a glint of admiration appeared in his eyes. He realized that Lee Cheong’s physique was extraordinary.

‘Huh! Doesn’t he have the ideal physique for learning martial arts?’

Namgung Jin had been a prodigy himself from a young age, and Namgung Hoe had watched over him as he grew. However, even Namgung Jin hadn’t possessed such an outstanding physique.

Namgung Hoe also wanted to have a good disciple—a remarkable disciple who could continue his and the Thousand Kingdom School’s advancement.

Lee Cheong was a prodigy who met all of Namgung Hoe’s expectations.

Namgung Hoe clicked his tongue inwardly.

‘Tsk! I acted too hastily.’

If he had known that Lee Cheong had such outstanding talent, there was no reason to sever the relationship with Lee Gwak so firmly. But now, his pride was too strong to retract his words.

He deliberately averted his gaze from Lee Cheong and spoke to Lee Gwak, “I’ll have my subordinate bring you the White Spirit Divine Pill.”

“Very well.”

“May I know when you plan to leave this place?”

“I plan to leave soon.”

“Your destination?”

“It seems you have many curiosities, Master Namgung.”

“What?”

“Since you’ve already insisted on parting ways, wouldn’t it be right to end the curiosity there as well? I don’t see why I should report my movements to you.”

Namgung Hoe’s face stiffened.

There was nothing wrong with Lee Gwak’s words. But human feelings are not always governed by reason alone.

Namgung Hoe’s voice grew colder.

“Don’t act arrogant just because your martial arts are a bit strong. Jianghu isn’t as easy as you think.”

“I am well aware of that.”

“You?”

Namgung Hoe’s eyes narrowed upwards.

Seeing Namgung Hoe like that, Lee Gwak inwardly sighed.

‘I’m sorry for Sobo, but the Thousand Kingdom School as it is now will never defeat the Jade Heaven Alliance.’

They say you can tell ten things from seeing one.

Namgung Hoe was practically the second in command of the Thousand Kingdom School. If such a person had only this level of awareness and judgment, it was easy to guess how dark the Thousand Kingdom School’s future was.

Lee Gwak had no reason to worry about the Thousand Kingdom School. They were strangers anyway. But the Thousand Kingdom School had Lim Sobo. That’s what worried him.

Lee Gwak said to Namgung Hoe, “If I’ve upset you, Master Namgung, please forgive me. It’s just that I’m sensitive because it’s time to attend to my child’s martial arts.”

“Hmm!”

“Since my child’s practice isn’t over yet, could you please leave now?”

It was an explicit dismissal.

Namgung Hoi’s face twisted viciously. But he could not get angrier.

“Uncle, let’s go now.”

“We’ll be going now.”

Because Namgung Jin and Namgung Yeon-hwa grabbed his arms and pulled him.

In the end, Namgung Hoe was dragged out by the two.

“Whew!”

Only then did Lee Gwak let out the sigh he had been holding.

It had been over three years since the war between the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Nine Sects began. Both sides needed as many experts as possible. Especially the Thousand Kingdom School, which was at a disadvantage in power, desperately needed external help. Yet, due to unnecessary pride or the desire to protect future power, they worsened their relationship with Lee Gwak.

If Namgung Hoe were truly a smart person, he would never have made such a mistake.

At that moment, Lee Cheong carefully spoke, “Dad, don’t be too upset.”

“I think he was just too anxious to see things clearly.”

It was as if Lee Cheong had read Lee Gwak’s mind.

Lee Gwak looked at Lee Cheong for a moment, then smiled softly.

“Yes! You’re right. Anxiety definitely narrows a person’s perspective.”

“Hehe!”

“Now that the unwelcome guest is gone, shall we resume training?”

“Yes!”

Lee Cheong answered energetically.

He began practicing the Eight Sects Sword Art again.

Lee Gwak’s face darkened as he watched his son’s training.

Ki-Jin Hwi, who had gone to track Gyeong Chu-wol, had not yet returned.

‘Brother!’


---


Lee Gwak waited three more days in Chaohu for Ki-Jin Hwi. But Ki-Jin Hwi did not return in the end.

In the end, Lee Gwak decided to go find Ki-Jin Hwi himself. He decided to leave Chaohu.

There were several inconveniences while staying at the Unhwa Inn. One of them was the influential people of Chaohu who came to visit almost every day.

They wanted to build connections with Lee Gwak.

Since it was a chaotic period, influential people believed that forming alliances with powerful figures would provide security. Although Lee Gwak planned to refuse, they continued to visit the Unhwa Inn and ask for meetings with him.

At first, he politely declined, but later they would come unexpectedly even at late hours and bother him, so he ended up locking the door to the annex.

Late at night, Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong prepared to leave the inn. Since their belongings were just a bundle, preparing wasn’t that difficult.

They planned to leave the inn at daybreak.

Even after packing all their belongings, Lee Gwak waited for Ki Jin-hwi with a faint hope. But even as the night deepened, Ki Jin-hwi did not return.

It was at the moment when Lee Gwak was about to give up waiting for Ki Jin-hwi and go to bed.

Lee Gwak sensed someone climbing over the wall of the annex.

Lee Gwak carefully stepped out so as not to wake Icheong. Then he saw a martial artist in dark green clothes, blending with the night’s darkness, standing in the courtyard of the annex.

The martial artist, who appeared to be in his mid to late forties, had a very confident demeanor. With eyes filled with confidence as if nothing in the world could stop him, he watched Lee Gwak quietly opening the door and coming out.

Lee Gwak spoke, “Who are you to trespass over someone else’s wall like this?”

“Ha ha! I am Oh Cheol-geuk. I apologize for visiting so suddenly at night. I have long admired your reputation, Great Hero Lee. In my desire to meet you, I committed a discourtesy; please forgive me this once.”

The martial artist who introduced himself as Oh Cheol-geuk didn’t erase the smile from his lips. His slyly grinning expression had a strange irritating effect.

Lee Gwak’s expression was colder than ever.

No matter how kindly a person might mask themselves, their true nature couldn’t be hidden. Especially not someone who had brazenly climbed over another’s wall in the dead of night.

“It seems that Master Oh could benefit from a lesson in etiquette.”

“Haha! I hear that often. But what can I say? A bandit’s nature is hard to change.”

“A thief?”

“Indeed! I’m from the Green Heaven Society. I believe you’re already familiar with our group.”

Lee Gwak’s expression hardened slightly. The Green Heaven Society was a new group formed in opposition to the policies of Sky High Castle, the main hub of the Green Forest bandits.

The enemies who attacked them when they came here on the Sanghyeon Escort Agency ship were members of the Green Heaven Society.

Seeing Lee Gwak’s expression stiffen, Oh Cheol-geuk didn’t wipe the smile off his face. On the contrary, he made a polite gesture to Lee

Gwak.

“Allow me to introduce myself formally. I am Oh Cheol-geuk, the leader of Green Heaven Society.”

“….”

“It seems I’ve struck a nerve with you, so let me offer my apologies for any offense.”

“And why would the leader of Green Heaven Society be paying me a visit?”

“I heard that one of my subordinates was deeply disrespectful to you, and I came to apologize on his behalf.”

“No need to apologize. I suffered no harm, after all.”

“Haha! Yet my conscience disagrees. My subordinate, Yuk Dal-hon, provoked you, and I would like to offer some form of compensation. If there’s anything you desire, feel free to say so. As long as it’s within my power, I will make it happen.”

Lee Gwak let out a deep sigh.

It was the same line he’d heard three days earlier from Namgung Hoe.

One was the second-in-command of a prestigious martial arts sect, the other a bandit chief, yet their approach was strikingly similar.

‘With these antics, who can tell the difference between a respected master and a bandit? They’re no better than children throwing tantrums.’

Shaking his head, Lee Gwak looked at Oh Cheol-geuk.

“There’s nothing I want from you.”

“Haha! Come now, if there’s something you desire, be honest and speak up.”

“Master Oh.”

“Yes?”

“Why don’t you just be upfront about why you’re really here instead of going on about nonsense?”

“Hmm!”

Oh Cheol-geuk’s face hardened slightly at Lee Gwak’s directness.

The smile had vanished, and his face took on a sharpness, with a hint of malice in his eyes.

Lee Gwak sensed that this was Oh Cheol-geuk’s true face. The smile had merely been a mask.

After a brief glare, Oh Cheol-geuk finally spoke.

“As I’ve heard, you’re not an easy man to deal with. All right, I’ll come to the point. I want you to join the Green Heaven Society. I will even make you our deputy leader.”
