A true master.

This term referred to a great master who dominated an entire era.

Lee Gwak was still far from being called a grandmaster. Compared to his fame, his influence was lacking, and he had not yet taught many disciples.

But everyone had to start somewhere.

Lee Gwak’s worries about guiding his disciples onto the right path were part of that beginning.

In fact, teaching his disciples demanded even more thought than teaching his own children, Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah.

As he lost himself in thought, a clear image naturally formed in his mind.

The martial arts that would suit Pi Jin-Yi best. The techniques that would perfectly match Jo So-Hye.

He began to understand how to systematically teach and develop them.

This was also a first for Lee Gwak.

It was a new form of immersion, born from his deep contemplation.

It felt strange, yet precious.

With a faint smile, Lee Gwak snapped out of his thoughts and noticed three people watching him. from nearby

Jinghae, Lim Sobo, and Cheon-wol.

Lee Gwak sensed Jinghae’s intense gaze boring into him.

His burning competitive spirit that had been suppressed until now was pouring out through his eyes. As with Po Cheon Wol, Jinghae appeared ready to clash with Lee Gwak to prove who was stronger.

Defeating Lee Gwak, the future true master, was his chance to make a name for himself and the Wudang Sect throughout the Jianghu.

However, Jinghae held back his competitive spirit with effort.

Fighting Lee Gwak here would not bring him any honor.

If he were to face Lee Gwak, it would have to be in front of countless witnesses – at the opening ceremony where the Wudang Sect would announce its return to the world.

If he defeated Lee Gwak at the Opening Ceremony, all the fame Lee Gwak currently enjoys would transfer to him and the Wudang Sect.

Once he sorted out his thoughts, the fiery competitive spirit in his eyes vanished as if it had never existed.

Jinghae clasped his fists respectfully and spoke.

“I hope we haven’t wasted your precious time with our intrusion.”

“Not at all.”

Lee Gwak shook his head gently with a soft smile.

“Grandmaster Lee!”

“Speak.”

“Now, I must ask for your answer.”

“You said the Opening Ceremony is in two months, correct?”

“Yes.”

“Understood. I will accept the invitation.”

“Really?”

“By then, I should have some free time. I will visit the Wudang Sect for the ceremony.”

“Thank you, Grandmaster Lee! Your presence lifts a great burden from my shoulders. My master will be overjoyed to hear of your attendance.”

The importance of an event depended on which masters attended as honored guests.

The more martial artists like Lee Gwak participated, the greater the prestige of Wudang Sect, drawing more attention from the world.

For the Wudang Sect, this was an unparalleled opportunity.

But Jinghae was not satisfied with just this.

He glanced subtly at Lim Sobo and continued.

“If it’s not too much trouble, I’d also like to extend an invitation to your strategist. Would she be able to accompany you?”

Lim Sobo frowned slightly at Jinghae’s words.

Even though she had clearly refused Jinghae, he blatantly disregarded her by indirectly asking Lee Gwak.

But she remained silent, her gaze fixed on Lee Gwak.

Since Jinghae had addressed the question to Lee Gwak and not her, his answer took precedence.

Lee Gwak studied Jinghae for a moment before speaking.

“My apologies.”

“Pardon?”

“As the Mad Martial Sect is still a newly established sect, her responsibilities are immense. If she were to leave, the sect would not function properly. Given the circumstances, it seems I will have to go alone.”

“But…”

“Just as the Wudang Sect has its laws, so too does our Mad Martial Sect have rules that must be upheld. I am sorry.”

“I… see. That’s unfortunate, but if the opportunity arises in the future, please do bring her along.”

“If the chance comes, I will.”

At Lee Gwak’s composed reply, Jinghae bit his lip slightly — but only for a moment.

He quickly regained his smile, as if nothing had happened.

“Well then, since I have achieved my goal, I will take my leave.”

“You’re leaving already?”

“I have other places to visit.”

“I must go to Haenam.”

“You mean the Martial Sword Troupe.”

“Yes. I must deliver the invitation to the leader of the Martial Sword Troupe as well.”

“That sounds arduous.”

“How could it be arduous when it’s for the grand ceremony marking the Wudang Sect’s return to the world after a century? Then, I shall see you at the Opening Ceremony, Grandmaster Lee!”

“Safe travels.”

“Farewell!”

Jinghae clasped his fists once more toward Lee Gwak before turning away.

As he passed Lim Sobo, he said,

“I look forward to meeting you again, Lady Lim.”

“I won’t see you off. Farewell.”

“Thank you.”

With that, Jinghae departed as abruptly as he had arrived.

Lim Sobo’s eyes were unusually cold as she watched his retreating figure.

Lee Gwak walked up to her side.

“Are you all right?”

“He’s an unpleasant man. Not at all like a Taoist.”

“Yes, he seems to have great ambition.”

“Please be careful when you go to Wudang. They’ll surely try to use you.”

“I’m aware.”

“He’s already practically joined hands with the Thousand Kingdom School and the Myriad Merchants Troupe.”

When Jinghae subdued Po Cheon Wol, the leaders of the Thousand Kingdom School and the Myriad Merchants Troupe were present.

Both their leaders were proud and formidable figures. If they had clashed with the Wudang Sect, they would have taken action by now. The fact that they remained quiet suggested some level of understanding had been reached.

The Thousand Kingdom School was the successor to the Five Great Families, including the Nam Gung Family. Meanwhile, the Wudang Sect was one of the Nine Great Sects.

Both sects had long histories and had interacted frequently. Even after a hundred years of isolation, their bonds would not have disappeared.

Thus, it wasn’t hard to guess that the Thousand Kingdom School and the Wudang Sect would cooperate.

Still, the Thousand Kingdom School wasn’t the main concern.

They wouldn’t blindly cooperate with the Wudang Sect. It was their tradition to both collaborate and keep each other in check.

This time would likely be no different.

The real problem was the Myriad Merchants Troupe.

The Myriad Merchants Troupe was fundamentally different from the Thousand Kingdom School.

While the Thousand Kingdom School was purely a martial sect, the Myriad Merchants Troupe was an assembly of merchants. They had amassed martial power by hiring mercenaries to protect their wealth, eventually becoming one of the Ten Great Sects.

They would ally with anyone who could safeguard their assets. The case of the Nine Dragons Clans was proof.

They funded the Nine Dragons Clan heavily and tried to use it.

Though the Nine Dragons Clan suffered heavy losses due to Lee Gwak and the Hao Clan, they wouldn’t give up so easily.

If Wudang’s traditions were combined with the wealth of the Myriad Merchants Troupe, the resulting destructive power would be unimaginable.

“With the Thousand Kingdom School aiding them as well, they could wield power rivaling—or even surpassing—the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“……”

“Gwak oraboni, you must be careful. The Thousand Kingdom School might not oppose you due to your ties with them, but the Myriad Merchants Troupe is different.”

“I’ll be careful.”

“You’re not alone anymore. As a leader responsible for countless lives, you must always prioritize your own safety.”

“Understood.”

Lee Gwak smiled faintly.

Seeing his smile, Lim Sobo felt her agitated heart settle.

‘Right. Oraboni will handle this well. I was worrying for nothing.’

Lim Sobo shook her head gently.

Lee Gwak studied her for a moment before shifting his gaze to Cheon Wol.

Since arriving, Cheon Wol had not spoken a word.

Since Yeo Jungwol’s death, Cheon Wol had changed the most.

He had never been very talkative, but now he was even more silent, immersing himself in martial arts to an almost mad degree.

Aside from events like today, he spent all day training in the practice grounds.

Cheon Wol was like a finely honed sword.

A sharp aura seemed to radiate from him, as if he could cut through anything.

“Cheonwol.”

“Yes, brother.”

“Ease up a little.”

“Huh?”

“If you’re too tense, you’ll break someday.”

“That’s… not so easy.”

“I know. But a relaxed mind can accept new things. Right now, your heart is filled only with martial arts. To reach a higher state, you must also know how to let go. Think about it.”

“Yes!”

Lee Gwak offered no further advice.

Advice could only be accepted when the person was ready.

Someday, when his anger had subsided and he had the space to reflect on himself, he would be able to consider Lee Gwak’s words and improve himself.

Cheon Wol’s heart was still filled with rage. Until that calmed and he found peace, he would not be ready to truly hear Lee Gwak’s words.

No matter how long it took, Lee Gwak was willing to wait.

Lim Sobo asked.

“So you’re going to the Wudang sect in two months?”

“The opening ceremony is in two months, so I should go a little earlier.”

“All eyes in the Jianghu will be on them. For us, it’s a golden opportunity.”

“An opportunity?”

“We have bought time to increase our strength while the Jianghu’s attention is diverted. Everyone will be too focused on the Wudang Sect to pay attention to us.”

Lee Gwak nodded at Lim Sobo’s words.

The Mad Martial Sect was transforming day by day.

Lim Sobo and the strategists were recruiting talent and establishing an efficient system.

What Jinghae had seen was merely the surface of the Mad Martial Sect.

The true core lay with Lim Sobo and strategists like Cheong Un-san.

Frustrated that they couldn’t show their full talents in the Jade Heaven Alliance, they threw themselves into their work with reckless energy.

With ample financial resources to support the sect’s foundation, they didn’t have to worry about trial and error. After several iterations, they had developed an efficient structure, and the Mad Martial Sect was evolving rapidly.

Lim Sobo was at the center of it all.

She painted the grand vision, while strategists like Cheong Un-san filled in the details.

Without her, none of this would have been possible.

Lee Gwak said to her,

“Thank you.”

“What for?”

“Just… you’ve been working so hard.”

“What nonsense. Am I an outsider? As the Mad Martial Sect’s strategist, hard work is expected.”

“I suppose so.”

“Oh, right! My younger brother will be joining us soon.”

“Your brother? Jimun?”

“Yes! When I told him I was here, he said he wanted to come too.”

“That’s great.”

Lee Gwak smiled brightly.

Lim Sobo’s younger brother, Lim Jimun, also shared a deep connection with Lee Gwak.

Like Lim Sobo, Lim Jimun was also a genius. While Lim Sobo specialized in strategy, Lim Jimun excelled in both martial arts and scholarship—a true prodigy.

His arrival would undoubtedly be a great boon to the still-fledgling Mad Martial Sect.

“Once Jimun arrives, there’s something I’ll need your help with, Oraboni.”

“What is it?”

“Deploy this around the Mad Martial Sect.”

Lim Sobo took out a neatly folded piece of paper from her sleeve and handed it to Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak unfolded it and examined the contents.

“This…?”

“The Six Direction Iron Wall Formation that Master and I developed.”

“Six Direction Iron Wall Formation?”

“Originally, it was designed to fortify the defenses of the Jade Heaven Alliance. It combines formations and mechanisms to allow a minimal number of defenders to protect a fortress.”

“Hmm.”

Lee Gwak let out a hum without realizing it.

He quickly understood the true power of the formation.

The formation consisted of seven intricate formations and twelve mechanisms.

Illusion and maze formations confused enemies, throwing them into chaos. Lost and disoriented, intruders would be led straight into deadly traps and formations.

The Killing Formations and Mechanisms interlocked like cogwheels to precisely eliminate any intruders.

Once fully set up, an ironclad fortification would rise, guarding all six directions — heaven, earth, north, south, east, and west — hence the name.

Originally, Lim Sobo and her master had created the formation to protect the Jade Heaven Alliance, but now she intended to set it up around the Mad Martial Sect.

However, the formation required experts who were highly skilled in both mechanics and formation arts.

Setting it up was too difficult for ordinary people. That’s why, even though Lim Sobo had finished the design long ago, she never dared to try it.

But with Lim Jimun’s arrival, things would change.

Lim Jimun was a master of formations, acknowledged even by Lim Sobo. In terms of formations alone, he could be called the best in the world. And Lee Gwak was a master of mechanisms.

Only by combining their skills could the Sixdirection Iron Wall Formation be realized.

‘Once the Six Direction Iron Wall Formation is complete, the Mad Martial Sect will become an impregnable fortress.’

A fortress that would never fall, no matter what external forces tried to invade.

This was the future of the Mad Martial Sect that Lim Sobo envisioned.
