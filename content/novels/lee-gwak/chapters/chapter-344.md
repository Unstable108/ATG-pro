Lee Gwak silently gazed at Mok Seon Wol for a moment.

It seemed that Mok Seon Wol really didn’t know this place had been a branch of Hao Clan.

The Hao Clan had gone to great lengths to conceal their identity, and Mok Seon Wol and Dragon Heaven Valley had been entirely focused on the Jade Heaven Alliance. That’s why she hadn’t known.

Lee Gwak spoke frankly.

“This place was a branch of the Hao Clan.”

“A branch of the Hao Clan? Here?”

“Yes.”

“Good heavens! Why would the Hao Clan’s branch be here?”

Only then did Mok Seon Wol’s expression harden.

She had heard reports this morning of a fire that had completely destroyed this place. At the time, she hadn’t thought much of it.

Fires in the slums were a common occurrence. But if the burned-down building was a branch of the Hao Clan, the story changed entirely.

“Are you sure this was really the Hao Clan’s branch? How do you know this, Master Lee?”

“I am close with the Hao Clan’s young master. We are like brothers. That’s how I know.”

“Hmm.”

Mok Seon Wol let out a low hum.

She knew Lee Gwak wasn’t the type to lie.

“If this really was the Hao Clan branch, why was it burned down?”

“Take a look at this.”

Instead of answering, Lee Gwak handed her a broken sword fragment he had been holding. As Mok Seon Wol examined the fragment, her eyes sharpened.

“A master cut this.”

“Yes.”

“So a master attacked this place, killed everyone and set it on fire?”

“That’s what I think.”

“How could that happen? How dare they do such a thing right under the Dragon Heaven Valley’s nose?”

Mok Seon Wol bit her red lip in frustration.

Although she was busy with the war against the Jade Heaven Alliance, the fact that martial artists had clashed swords under her watch infuriated her.

“Do you know who the culprit is?”

“Not yet.”

“Do you have any leads?”

“I only just arrived myself.”

He meant he was as clueless as she was.

“Sigh! I apologize, Master Lee. My nerves are on edge, and I’ve been rude. This isn’t your fault.”

“I understand.”

“Master Lee!”

“Yes?”

“Do you know how long you’ll be staying here?”

“I can’t say for sure, but I’ll be here for a while.”

“Then may I ask you a difficult favour later?”

“You can ask anything.”

“Without even knowing what it is?”

“I am already deeply indebted to you and Dragon Heaven Valley. If I can repay that debt, I’ll do anything.”

Three years ago, thanks to Mok Seon Wol and Dragon Heaven Valley, Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong had escaped unharmed from the Heaven and Earth Net of the White Light Sect.

Although Mok Seon Wol’s help had been calculated, Lee Gwak wouldn’t have been able to protect Lee Cheong without a scratch.

Lee Gwak hadn’t forgotten her kindness. That’s why he could easily agree to any request.

“Thank you… Master Lee. I won’t forget this kindness.”

“No need to be thankful. If you need help, just ask. I’ll do my best.”

“……”

Mok Seon Wol was silent for a moment, staring blankly at Lee Gwak.

When she first met him, he had been a minor martial artist. But in just a few years, he had risen to become one of the top masters in Jianghu, his reputation far surpassing hers and rivalling even the seven leaders of the Seven Great Sects.

Such an absolute martial artist had not forgotten the small favour and had said that he would definitely repay it.

Having seen people who treated promises lightly and disregarded trust, Mok Seon Wol found Lee Gwak’s sincerity refreshingly shocking.

For some reason, she couldn’t bring herself to speak easily.

Mok Seon Wol’s lips twitched like a fish’s before she finally bowed her head.

“Then… I’ll contact you again later.”

“Mok Seon Wol!”

“Yes?”

“Be cautious of Woo Mun Pae… and the Martial Sword Troupe.”

At Lee Gwak’s words, Mok Seon Wol’s expression stiffened.

“Damn it! It’s almost the end of autumn, and there are still mosquitoes.”

Seok Yi Cheon grumbled as he swatted a mosquito that had landed on his arm.

He killed it, but a red bump had already formed where it had bitten him. It had bitten him before he could react.

Seok Yi Cheon scratched the bite with his fingernail.

“Ugh! It’s so itchy.!”

When the itching didn’t subside, Seok Yi Cheon shook his head in frustration.

Perhaps because they were in the southern region, even in late autumn, the mosquitoes were relentless.

And they were vicious—once bitten, the itch would last at least a day.

Seok Yi Cheon wasn’t the only one suffering; his squad members were also struggling with the mosquitoes.

They had tried burning medicinal herbs to drive the mosquitoes away with smoke, but it was no use.

“They say late autumn mosquitoes are the worst…”

Seok Yi Cheon grumbled as he picked up the sword beside him.

Swoosh!

When he drew the sword, the blade, chipped in several places, was revealed.

Seok Yi Cheon was the only one still using a sword supplied by the Jade Heaven Alliance.

He had been too stingy to buy a new one and had stubbornly maintained this one. But it seemed to have reached its limit.

“Tsk! I’ll have to replace this sword when we get back to the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“Squad Leader, you should save where you can. What will you do if the sword breaks?”

The deputy squad leader scolded Seok Yi Cheon.

“You’re right. Is there a skilled blacksmith around here?”

“Do you think someone like that would be in a place like this?”

“True. I guess I’ll have to replace it when we get back to the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“Just take good care of your sword for now.”

“Got it.”

Seok Yi Cheon took out a whetstone and began carefully sharpening his sword.

Swipe, swipe!

If nothing else, he was confident in his ability to sharpen a blade.

With each stroke of his hand, the sword’s edge grew sharper.

Just then.

“Squad Leader!”

The youngest member of the 17th squad came running, panting heavily.

Seok Yi Cheon frowned as he looked at the young recruit.

“What is it?”

“The Unit Leader is calling for you.”

“The Unit Leader? You mean the Demon Squad Leader?”

“Yes!”

At the recruit’s answer, Seok Yi Cheon stopped sharpening his sword and stood up.

It wasn’t just anyone—it was the highest-ranking leader summoning him. He couldn’t delay even for a moment.

“Do you know why he’s calling me?”

“He didn’t say. Just that you should come immediately…”

“Damn it! What does he want to make me do now?”

Seok Yi Cheon wore an anxious expression.

He was already uneasy about being dispatched here unexpectedly.

Since arriving, he had spent several days idly, not having any work to do while everyone else was busy. Being the only one without anything to do was a significant burden for Seok Yi Cheon.

From his experience, whenever there was an unexpected break like this, it usually meant a big task was coming up.

The vice team leader and team members each said to him,

“Take care.”

“Please, bring back an easy task.”

“If it’s a difficult mission, just say no.”

Seok Yi Cheon waved his hand dismissively and moved forward.

It wasn’t worth responding.

What kind of place did they think the position of an outer hall squad leader was, that he could just refuse orders from above?

An outer hall squad leader’s job was to follow orders without question, no matter what.

Ignoring the comments from behind, Seok Yi Cheon walked toward Ban Cheon Sang’s residence.

Guided by the martial artists standing guard, he entered Ban Cheon Sang’s residence, and the first face he recognized was,

“Cheon Gwang!”

It was Go Cheon Gwang, the squad leader of the 19th squad.

He, too, had been summoned by Ban Cheon-sang.

A look of relief flashed across Seok Yi Cheon’s face.

Though he didn’t know why Ban Cheon-sang had called them, it was clear that they would be working with the 19th Squad, led by Go Cheon Gwang. That alone was a great comfort.

Go Cheon Gwang also showed a hint of relief when he saw Seok Yi Cheon. Without words it was clear that they shared the same thoughts.

Seok Yi Cheon greeted Ban Cheon-sang.

“Squad leader Seok Yi Cheon of the seventeenth squad, reporting as summoned.”

“Squad Leader Seok!”

“Yes!”

“I’ve heard that you’re the oldest of the outer squad leaders. Is that true?”

“I believe so.”

Seok Yi Cheon’s expression became uncomfortable at the sudden mention of his age. He couldn’t fathom Ban Cheon-sang’s intentions.

Ban Cheon-sang smiled coldly at Seok Yi Cheon’s reaction.

The moment Seok Yi Cheon saw that smile, he felt like a snake slithering down his spine.

“With age comes a strong sense of responsibility, doesn’t it?”

“Well…”

“Isn’t it?”

“Yes, it is.”

“Good.”

“Huh? What do you mean?”

“I’m going to give you an important job.”

“What kind?”

Seok Yi Cheon tensed up. Ban Cheon-sang pointed at Go Cheon Gwang and continued.

“You’ll take two carriages to the Hwangwon Plain with the Nineteenth squad.”

“Carriages, you say?”

“Yes. When you arrive at Hwangwon Plain, there will be people waiting for you. Deliver the carriages to them and return. Can you do that?”

“Well…”

“It’s not difficult. In addition to squads Seventeen and Nineteen, Troop Fifteen will also accompany you. You’ll be in charge of all three squads. Can you handle it?”

“I… can do it.”

Seok Yi Cheon replied with difficulty.

He had neither the power nor the justification to refuse. His destiny was to follow orders without question.

“The carriages are waiting outside.”

“Do we leave immediately?”

“There is no time. Leave at once.”

“Understood.”

Ban Cheon-sang waved his hand dismissively.

Seok Yi Cheon and Go Cheon Gwang bowed to Ban Cheon-sang and left the room.

As they left, Ban Cheon-sang turned his gaze towards the interior of the residence.

“I have done as you instructed. Is this satisfactory?”

“It is!”

A deep voice answered, and a tall man emerged from the inner room.

The man, with fierce tiger-like eyes and a blunt nose, was none other than Yong Cheon Myeong.

Ban Cheon-sang asked Yong Cheon Myung, “Are you going to tell me what’s in the carriages?

“You will find out later, of course.”

“Young Master! I am the one in charge here. It doesn’t make sense that there is something here that I don’t know about.

“Ha. I’m keeping it from you for your sake”

“What?”

“If you’re not careful, you might get splashed with dirt too.”

“…”

“It’s better for you not to know.”

“Young Master?”

“Trust me.”

Yong Cheon Myung stood with his hands behind his back, looking at Ban Cheon-sang with an air of arrogance.

Under his gaze, Ban Cheon-sang shivered, feeling an inexplicable sense of foreboding.

＊＊＊

Seok Yi Cheon looked at the heavily loaded carriages and asked Go Cheon Gwang, “Do you know what’s inside these?”

“Like you, I was suddenly summoned here. I don’t know anything either.”

Go Cheon Gwang shook his head.

He, too, had been relaxing when he was abruptly called, so he was just as clueless.

The carriages were covered with thick waterproof tarps.

Because of this, it was impossible to tell what was inside.

Seok Yi Cheon touched the tarp and muttered, “Should we take a quick peek?”

“Hey! Don’t do that. You’ll just get yourself in trouble.”

Go Cheon Gwang quickly stopped him.

This was a direct order from Ban Cheon-sang himself.

Questioning it was out of the question, and opening the cargo without permission would only lead to bigger problems.

At Go Cheon Gwang’s insistence, Seok Yi Cheon let out a deep sigh.

“Fine! I know that. But I’m still curious.”

“I’m curious too. But I’m not going to risk my life to satisfy my curiosity. Brother, if you want to die, die alone. Don’t drag me into it.”

“Alright, alright! Geez, you’re so dramatic.”

Seok Yi Cheon clicked his tongue in dissatisfaction.

“Don’t dwell on it, brother. We just need to do as we’re told. You know that, so why are you making it difficult?”

“I’m just feeling uneasy. Ugh!”

“What’s there to be uneasy about? All we have to do is safely transport the cargo to the designated location.”

“I hope it’s that simple…”

Seok Yi Cheon trailed off.

‘How nice it would be if Gwak were here right now…’
