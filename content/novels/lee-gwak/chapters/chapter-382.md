“Phew!”

A short man with a missing front tooth sighed as he looked ahead.

In the distance, a massive fortress was visible.

The grandeur of the fortress stood in stark contrast to the serene landscape, causing the man’s eyes to tremble slightly.

“To think I’d come here again.”

His shoulders trembled with tension.

For a moment, he stared blankly at the fortress.

“Celestial Demon Troupe…”

The huge fortress that felt intimidating even when viewed from afar was none other than Celestial Demon Troupe.

The man shook his head.

“Gyeong Chu-wol. I can’t believe you fled to the Celestial Demon Troupe.”

The man was Ki Jin-hwi, the one who had been tracking Gyeong Chu-wol for stealing his family’s secret techniques.

Ki Jin-hwi and Gyeong Chu-wol had been in a chase for months.

Whenever Gyeong Chu-wol used sorcery to cover his tracks, Ki Jin-hwi countered with his own spells to expose them. When Gyeong Chu-wol tried to blend into crowds, Ki Jin-hwi relied on his experience to single him out.

Gyeong Chu-wol had shuddered at Ki Jin-hwi’s persistence.

He even attempted a surprise attack to eliminate Ki Jin-hwi, but it was ineffective against Ki Jin-hwi, who was fully prepared after having been attacked once before.

In the end, Gyeong Chu-wol’s last resort for escape was the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Ki Jin-hwi bit his lip until it bled.

He had once visited the Celestial Demon Troupe as part of an envoy from the

Jade Heaven Alliance. Having been there once, he knew how terrifying the place was.

The Celestial Demon Troupe was teeming with numerous masters and fierce martial artists.

No matter how skilled Gyeong Chu-wol was in sorcery, if his true identity were exposed within the Celestial Demon Troupe, he wouldn’t survive. Nevertheless, Gyeong Chu-wol had willingly chosen to flee there.

It was a desperate gamble – better to risk the dangers of the Celestial Demon Troupe than to be caught by Gyeong Chu-wol.

Gyeong Chu-wol was confident.

He had his sorcery, which included spells to alter his appearance or cloud others’ minds to manipulate them.

The initial hurdle would be tough, but once he assimilated into the Celestial Demon Troupe, he would find a way to rise to power.

The Celestial Demon Troupe already possessed overwhelming strength. If Gyeong Chu-wol’s sorcery were added to the mix, it would spell unparalleled disaster for the world.

Ki Jin-hwi had to stop him before that happened.

“Damn it!”

Ki Jin-hwi cursed under his breath and took a step forward.

Having come this far, there was no turning back.

He resented Gyeong Chu-wol for driving the situation to this extent, but nevertheless he advanced towards the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Ki Jin-hwi had already been to the Celestial Demon Troupe once before.

However, that time, he was part of a diplomatic mission, so there was at least some guarantee of safety. But not this time.

If his identity was revealed in the Celestial Demon Troupe, his life could not be guaranteed.

Ki Jin-hwi bit his lip until it bled.

“Even if something happens to me, I will certainly take you as my comrade.”

Ki Jin-hwi took heavy steps toward the Celestial Demon Troupe.

“Have you arrived?”

As Lee Gwak came outside, Seok Yi-cheon greeted him with a warm smile. Seok Yi-cheon had a small bundle on his back.

Next to Seok Yi-cheon were Cheol Gwang-woo, Bang Ye-in, and Bang Ju-gwang.

Lee Gwak bowed lightly to Bang Ju-gwang.

“Thank you for everything.”

“What are you talking about? It’s nothing!”

Bang Ju-gwang waved his hand dismissively.

“Thanks to you, I had a good rest. Thank you.”

“If you’re heading to the Sky High Castle, you’d best get moving. Go on.”

“Understood!”

Following Bang Ju-gwang’s advice, Lee Gwak decided to meet Lim So-bo first.

Even if he didn’t bring Lim So-bo out of Sky High Castle, he at least needed to talk to her.

At that moment, Cheol Gwang-woo tightly grasped Bang Ye-in’s small hands.

“I’ll be back.”

“Mm!”

“Don’t be sad while I’m gone.”

“I know!”

“Ugh!”

“Why so much nagging? Just go already.”

Whack!

Bang Ye-in ended up smacking Cheol Gwang-woo on the back.

Seok Yi-cheon frowned at the sight.

“Hey! If you’re going to be like this, don’t come. Lee Gwak and I can manage just fine.”

“Ah! But I should go to take care of you two.”

“Forget it. I’m not so old that I need someone to wait on me, and I can look after Lee Gwak just fine. You stay here with Miss Bang. It’s unbearable watching lovebirds when you’re single.”

Seok Yi-cheon’s eyebrows shot up.

Originally, only Lee Gwak and Seok Yi-cheon were supposed to go to the Sky High Castle.

Lee Gwak had told Cheol Gwang-woo to stay behind for Bang Ye-in’s sake. But Cheol Gwang-woo insisted on accompanying them to help, only to then act all lovey-dovey, provoking Seok Yi-cheon’s anger.

Despite Seok Yi-cheon’s annoyance, Cheol Gwang-woo just grinned shamelessly, showing no hint of embarrassment.

“Ugh!”

The embarrassment was all Bang Ye-in’s.

“Tch! A bearish bastard with a face as thick as iron… What do you even see in him?”

“He’s reliable.”

“Reliable my foot! Tch!”

Bang Ju-gwang clicked his tongue.

Cheol Gwang-woo bowed his head to Bang Ju-gwang.

“Then I’ll take my leave. Father!”

“Enough already. Just go.”

“Yes!”

Scratching his head, Cheol Gwang-woo stood beside Lee Gwak.

Only Lee Gwak, Seok Yi-cheon, and Cheol Gwang-woo would go to the Sky High Castle. Bang Ye-in had wanted to come, but Bang Ju-gwang refused.

Bang Ju-gwang said he had things to teach Bang Ye-in and ordered her to stay at the Inn. No matter how much Bang Ye-in loved to wander, she couldn’t defy her father’s words.

“Then we’ll be going.”

Lee Gwak’s group said goodbye to Bang Ju-gwang and Bang Ye-in and left.

Cheol Gwang-woo, reluctant to part with Bang Ye-in, kept looking back. Seok Yi-cheon jabbed him in the ribs with his elbow.

“Enough already. She’s not going anywhere. Why the fuss?”

Seok Yi-cheon scowled.

His elbow hurt as if he’d hit an iron plate.

Once they were far enough from the Fang Family Inn, Cheol Gwang Woo seemed to let go of his attachment and stopped looking back.

Lee Gwak walked straight ahead.

During his stay at the inn, he had thought endlessly and agonized over his decision.

In the end, he chose to meet Lim So-bo.

He wanted her advice, but more than that, he was worried about Cheon Wol and her.

To Lim So-bo, Yeo Jung-wol was like a father.

Though Tian Yue was deeply shocked, it couldn’t compare to Lim So-bo’s grief.

Lee Gwak couldn’t even begin to imagine how heartbroken she must be.

Suddenly, he reached into his chest.

He felt the pouch containing Yeo Jung-wol’s ashes.

Cheon Wol had left in such a hurry that he hadn’t taken it. Lee Gwak needed to deliver Yeo Jung-wol’s final remains to Lim So-bo.

That’s why he was heading to the Sky High Castle.

Cheol Gwang Woo approached Lee Gwak.

“I’ll guide you to the Sky High Castle.”

“Do you know the way?”

“Yes. I’ve been near there once before with Ye-in. I didn’t enter the Sky High Castle, though.”

“Then I’ll rely on you.”

“Don’t worry. I’ll take you the fastest route.”

Cheol Gwang Woo thumped his chest confidently.

Seok Yi-cheon shook his head at the sight.

“You bear bastard! Don’t get us lost.”

“Don’t worry.”

Cheol Gwang-woo grinned.

Lee Gwak also smiled faintly, remembering the first time he’d met Cheol Gwang-woo.

Back then, Cheol Gwang-woo’s eyes had been filled with rage and madness toward the world. His madness had been so intense it nearly took physical form.

Lee Gwak had been deeply concerned about Cheol Gwang-woo’s future. But his worries proved unnecessary—Cheol Gwang-woo had mellowed after meeting Bang Ye-in.

Now, looking at Cheol Gwang-woo, it was hard to imagine his former frenzied self.

‘Love truly changes a person.’

Lee Gwak marveled at the power of love.

The three of them walked together, sometimes bickering, sometimes laughing.

Cheol Gwang-woo and Seok Yi-cheon seemed tireless, constantly arguing or chatting.

Days passed like this.

Their journey to Okhwa Mountain was surprisingly smooth.

Cheol Gwang-woo seemed to have expected some trouble, but nothing happened. Not even a single bandit attack.

The Sky High Castle’s origins lay in the Green Forest’s Eighteen Fortresses.

In the past, there were too many mountain Fortresses, making unified control difficult. But the first castle lord, Mook Il-gwang, reduced the eighteen strongholds to six.

After that, the problem of central orders not reaching the lower ranks disappeared.

Especially near Sky High Castle, discipline was strictly enforced, to the point where even small-scale bandits couldn’t operate.

In a way, the area around Sky High Castle was the safest in the world.

“Tch! How ironic. The heart of the Green Forest is the safest place from bandits.”

Seok Yi-cheon clicked his tongue.

Cheol Gwang-woo nodded.

“Well, everyone keeps their own doorstep clean, right? They’re no different.”

“But why not do the same for So-bo?”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean, they manage their reputation so meticulously, so why can’t they manage someone as outstanding as So-bo properly?”

“Why? Greed, of course.”

“Greed?”

“They think Sister So-bo could leave anytime. So, they don’t want to give her too much power.”

“Hmm. That makes sense.”

“Sister Sobo is in an awkward position. She can’t give up her ties to the Thousand Kingdom School, but that means she can’t devote herself fully to the Sky High Castle, either.”

“I see. Being caught in the middle leaves her in limbo.”

Seok Yi-cheon nodded as if he finally understood.

The world was far from kind.

Especially Jianghu.

Even the smallest weakness would be exploited ruthlessly.

Pure righteousness and chivalry had long faded, replaced by an obsession with power.

In such a world, a young newcomer’s options were limited—even for a once-in-a-generation genius.

“Miss So-bo must be frustrated. Tch!”

Seok I-cheon clicked his tongue again.

He felt a special connection to Lim So-bo, having watched her grow up.

At that moment, Lee Kwak pointed ahead and said.

“I think that’s Jangsu Province.”

In the distance, a bustling city came into view.

“Where? Ah, yes. That’sJangsu.”

Zhangshu County was located right at the foot of Mount Okhwa.

Originally an ordinary province, it had developed rapidly after the Sky High Castle was established on Mount Okhwa. Now it rivaled any major city in the Jianghu.

People called Jangsu the “Green Forest province.”

The city of the Green Forest.

It was home to more bandits than anywhere else in the world.

To ascend Mount Okhwa and reach Sky High Castle, one had to pass through Jangsu.

Without hesitation, Lee Gwak’s group entered Jangsu.

The city was even more vibrant than it appeared from the outside.

Cheol Gwang Woo pointed to an inn on the main street.

“We stayed here last time. The rooms are clean, perfect for a night’s stay. The food wasn’t bad either.”

“Then let’s stay here tonight and climb Mount Okhwa tomorrow.”

“Yes!”

Cheol Gwang Woo replied and headed into the inn.

The interior was quite spacious. The first-floor dining area had many tables, about half of which were empty since it was still early.

Cheol Gwang Woo spoke to the innkeeper.

“We’ll stay for one night. Three rooms, please.”

“Ah! You’re the merchant who came last time.”

“Do you still remember me?”

“How could I forget someone as big as you and your companion? I’ll give you the three rooms at the end of the hall. They’re quieter than the others.”

“Haha! Thank you.”

“What about meals?”

“Bring them now. Some light snacks too.”

“Understood.”

Cheol Gwang Woo prepaid for the rooms and meals before returning to Lee Gwak and Seok Yi-cheon’s table.

As he sat down, Cheol Gwang Woo spoke,

“The innkeeper recognizes me, so news of my arrival will probably reach the Sky High Castle before tonight.”

Lee Gwak and Seok Yi-cheon weren’t surprised.

They had expected as much.

Half the people in Jangsu are likely connected to the Sky High Castle. It wouldn’t be strange if they reported information to the castle.

Cheol Gwang Woo grinned, showing his teeth.

“The fastest way into Sky High Castle is to have them come fetch us. Hehe!”

“For a bear bastard, your mind works like a weasel’s.”

Seok Yi-cheon made a slightly disgusted face.

Lee Gwak looked out the window at Mount Okhwa.

The mountain was majestic, and the aura it gave off was also extraordinary. In particular, it had a strong sinister aura.

“Even if the Sky High Castle hadn’t been built here, bandits would have overrun this place eventually.”

Just then, a cold object drifted on the wind and landed on the back of Lee Gwak’s hand.

‘Snow?’

It was snowing outside the window.

The whole world was turning white.

Thus began the winter in Jianghu.
