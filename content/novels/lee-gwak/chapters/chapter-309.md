Seo Wang-ho and Lee Cheong’s duel was fierce.

Seo Wang-ho’s special technique was legwork.

People often said, “Southern fists, Northern kicks” . It meant that southern fighters excelled at punching, while northern fighters were skilled with their legs.

With his sturdy physique and abundant strength, he was ideally suited for executing powerful leg techniques.

Crash!

Seo Wang-ho attacked Lee Cheong with a ferocious momentum. His thick legs swept past like logs, and a gust of wind blew over Lee Cheong. But Lee Cheong remained calm and used his footwork to slip out of range.

“Do you think you can escape?” Seo Wang-ho roared as he followed Lee Cheong closely.

He hopped and bounded in the blink of an eye, resembling a yaksha. That’s why people called him “Little Yaksha”.

Bababababak!

In a heartbeat, Seo Wang-ho unleashed eighteen consecutive kicks.

The air was soon filled with nothing but the afterimages of his legs.

I can’t avoid them all.

Anyway, even if he dodged, Seo Wang-ho would keep chasing him down. Once Seo Wang-ho got fired up, his kicking technique was terrifying. Faced with that onslaught, Lee Cheong’s wooden blade felt like it would snap like straw. Yet he wasn’t afraid of Seo Wang-ho.

Though Seo Wang-ho’s leg techniques were fierce, Lee Cheong’s Eight Sects Sword Art was no less powerful.

“Hyaah!”

Lee Cheong unleashed the second form of the Eight Sects Sword Art, Raging Tidal Force.

Claang!

Seo Wang-ho’s leg collided with Lee Cheong’s blade in midair. Both martial artists shuddered from the impact but refused to yield a single inch.

Using the recoil, Seo Wang-ho launched another kick. His mastery of legwork was nearly at the level of “No-Shadow Kick” . But, Lee Cheong’s prowess was not to be underestimated.

His Eight Sects Sword Art was equally ruthless. In terms of momentum and sheer power, he wasn’t lagging behind Seo Wang-ho at all.

Pabababang!

The collision of steel-hardened legs and wooden blade caused the air to burst repeatedly.

“Wow!”

“Insane.”

The duel between the two, who seemed too mature to be mere children, thrilled the spectators.

While the earlier match between Yoo Seon-jin and Ho So-ryeon had been entertaining, the duel between Seo Wang-ho and Lee Cheong surpassed it in intensity.

Seo Wang-ho and Lee Cheong both held nothing back, furiously displaying their techniques.

Splinters flew from the wooden blade, and Seo Wang-ho’s legs bore bruises and cuts.

Pain distorted Seo Wang-ho’s face.

Despite his legs being trained to be as hard as steel, he was still young, and the agony was inevitable.

“All I need to do is break that sword.”

The wooden blade in Lee Cheong’s hands was already cracked and splintered, scattering fragments around.

It looked like it would break at any moment, but it held up. This made him even more puzzled.

It seemed on the verge of breaking, yet it stubbornly held on, adding to his frustration.

Just as much as Seo Wang-ho, Lee Cheong was struggling.

Younger and physically less robust than Seo Wang-ho, Lee Cheong was at a disadvantage from the start. Yet, he never retreated, continuously deploying the Eight Sects Sword Art.

Even after using the fourth form of Eight Sects Sword Art, Blood Dragon Roar, he couldn’t secure a decisive victory as Seo Wang-ho matched him with equally powerful techniques.

In the end, Lee Cheong unleashed the fifth form of Eight Sects Sword Art, Lone Scorch Demon.

It was a move he had only recently learned thanks to Lee Gwak’s help. Lee Cheong bet everything he had on Lone Scorch Demon.

Seo Wang-ho also executed his most powerful technique, Overlord’s Kick, regardless of whether his leg would break. He gave it his all.

Crash!

Lee Cheong’s wooden blade and Seo Wang-ho’s leg collided.

At that moment, Lee Cheong’s eyes widened.

He could see his wooden blade, which had barely held up until now, being split in two by Seo Wang-ho’s Overlord’s Kick.

Seo Wang-ho’s leg, having broken the wooden blade, exploded into Lee Cheong’s chest.

Bang!

“Ugh!”

Lee Cheong screamed as he was flung backwards.

“Argh!”

Seo Wang-ho landed on the ground, barely supporting himself on one leg.

Breaking Lee Cheong’s wooden blade had also severely damaged his own leg.

‘Is it broken?’

The pain in his leg was intense. Yet, Seo Wang-ho masked his pain and forced himself to stand.

He desperately needed the title of the champion of this martial arts tournament.

His martial arts school, Goseon Martial Hall, was like a fading sun. Although its techniques were powerful, they were too difficult to master, and it had been a long time since any new students had joined.

Seo Wang-ho had specifically joined this tournament to promote Goseon Martial Hall and continue its legacy. Winning the tournament hosted by the Nine Dragons Clan would definitely attract attention to Goseon Martial Hall.

“The winner is Goseon Martial Hall’s Seo Wang-ho.”

The verdict was finally announced.

Seo Wang-ho let out a sigh of relief. On one hand, his heart felt cold.

‘If that guy had been wielding a real blade, I would have been the one to fall.’

That’s how formidable Lee Cheong’s blade technique was.

It was fortunate that it was a wooden blade; if it had been a real sword, his leg would have been severed in the first few clashes.

It was a victory achieved by exploiting the rules of the tournament, which prohibited real weapons. It could be seen as shameful, but Seo Wang-ho was that desperate for victory.

“Ugh!”

Lee Cheong shook his head and stood up.

He briefly looked at his broken wooden blade before turning to Seo Wang-ho.

“Brother! Congratulations. You won.”

“Thank you.”

“Phew! I was somewhat confident, but I still have much to learn.”

“No, you did well too. If you had…”

‘Had a real sword, the outcome would have been different.’

Seo Wang-ho swallowed his last words.

Regardless, he was the winner.

He needed to act like a winner.

Lee Cheong saluted Seo Wang-ho with a fist.

“I learned a lot today. I truly wish for your victory, brother.”

“Yes!”

Seo Wang-ho nodded.

Lee Cheong looked at Seo Wang-ho for a moment before turning and descending the platform.

For the first time in his life, he had entered a tournament with such passion. And now, to lose on the brink of the final competition, his tears were flowing uncontrollably.

He tried to appear calm onstage, but the defeat stung in his chest.

As he stepped down, he saw Lee Gwak.

“D…Dad! I lost. I really wanted to win… Hic!”

“You did well.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Why? You fought well. I’m proud of you.”

“Sob! Sob!”

Comforted by Lee Gwak’s praise, Lee Cheong finally shed the tears he had been holding back.

‘Defeat will make you stronger.’

Lee Gwak had experienced this too.

While serving as an outer hall martial artist of the Jade Heaven Alliance, Lee Gwak had endured countless losses and humiliations. It was painful back then, but in hindsight, those hardships helped him grow into who he was now.

Lee Gwak firmly believed that Lee Cheong, too, would overcome the pain of defeat and grow even stronger.

After a while, Lee Cheong calmed down and moved away from Lee Gwak’s embrace, wiping his tear-stained face with his sleeve.

Lee Gwak silently took Lee Cheong’s hand, which he grasped tightly.

Lee Cheong’s gaze then turned to the stage.

The true final match was taking place between Ho So-ryeon and Seo Wang-ho.

Without blinking, Lee Cheong watched their confrontation.

Bang bang bang!

Ho So-ryeon and Seo Wang-ho clashed with ferocious momentum.

Ho So-ryeon’s White whips and Seo Wang-ho’s legs intertwined and separated repeatedly.

“Wow!”

The crowd erupted in cheers at the spectacular duel.

As the match reached its climax, the winner and loser were soon determined.

The ultimate champion of the human-level martial arts tournament was Ho So-ryeon.

In front of her, Seo Wang-ho sat on the ground, clutching his shaking leg.

Seo Wang-ho’s face was filled with frustration.

‘If only my leg had been intact, I definitely would have won.’

Ho So-ryeon’s skills were undeniably inferior to Seo Wang-ho’s. If Seo Wang-ho had been in full health, he could have easily defeated her.

Perhaps this outcome wouldn’t have happened if his leg hadn’t gotten damaged. But in the end, those were just excuses.

If he had truly been strong, he would never have lost to Ho So-ryeon. In the end, he lost because he wasn’t strong enough.

“Damn it!”

Seo Wang-ho punched the platform. Ho So-ryeon looked at him with a slightly bitter expression.

She knew it too. She had won because she was lucky. But the martial artists didn’t care about that fact.

The crowd roared, chanting Ho So-ryeon’s name as the final victor, giving her thunderous applause.

Regardless of the circumstances, the winner takes all in the Jianghu.

Lee Cheong watched this principle of the Jianghu unfold right before his eyes.

Even though he was defeated, it became a pivotal moment of growth for him.

After the champion of the Human Rank Tournament was decided, the tournament continued.

After several more matches, the champions of the Heaven and Earth Ranks were determined.

The spectators went wild for them as well.

Thus, the Nine Dragons Clan Martial Arts Tournament came to a grand conclusion.

“This is amazing! It wasn’t worth coming to the Nine Dragons Clan for nothing.”

“The champions will all join the Nine Dragons Clan, right?”

“Probably. Now they’ll enjoy all sorts of wealth and fame. I’m jealous.”

Still buzzing from the excitement, people talked about the winners as they moved on.

Now that the tournament was over, it was time to leave the Nine Dragons Clan.

People gathered in small groups and left the Nine Dragons Clan.

As Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong were also moving among the people, a middle-aged man approached them.

Noticing Lee Gwak’s inquisitive look, the man introduced himself.

“My name is Bu Yak-young, the chief administrator of the Nine Dragons Clan. If you have time, could you follow me?”

“Why is that?”

“The sect Master wishes to see you. Both of you…”

Lee Gwak’s eyes sparkled.

There was no reason for the lord of the Nine Dragons Clan, Gyeong Un-cheon, to seek him out.

Reading Lee Gwak’s thoughts, Bu Yak-young smiled and said,

“Don’t be so nervous. The lord is interested in your son.”

“Cheong?”

“Yes! The lord will explain in detail. Please come with me.”

It sounded like a request from the chief administrator of the Nine Dragons Clan, but it was practically an order.

Lee Gwak looked at Bu Yak-young for a moment and nodded.

“Let’s go.”

Bu Yak-young smiled as if he had expected this and led the way.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong followed Bu Yak-young.

They were led to the deepest part of the inner court,the lord’s hall, where the lord resided. As expected, the security was tight.

Lee Gwak glanced at Lee Cheong, feeling the tight grip on his hand. Lee Cheong was nervous.

Lee Gwak tapped Lee Cheong’s palm lightly, and Lee Cheong looked up at him.

Lee Gwak smiled silently.

‘Dad!’

Finally, Lee Cheong’s tension melted away.

Gyeong Un-cheon, the lord of the Nine Dragons Clan, was certainly a remarkable person, but his father, Lee Gwak, was also a martial artist who could shake the world.

It seemed silly now to be so on edge. Lee Cheong still didn’t know why Gyeong Un-cheon wanted to see him, but surely, as long as he had his father, nothing bad would happen.

A slight smile appeared on Lee Cheong’s face.

Bu Yak-young opened the door to the grand hall and entered.

A formidable middle-aged man sat on a grand throne, decorated with nine dragons.

He wore a crown with a dragon motif and a robe embroidered with dragons piercing the clouds. His strong features and piercing eyes also evoked the image of a dragon.

Though countless martial artists roamed the world, there was only one man whose presence evoked the majesty of a dragon like this.

Blood Sea Divine Sword, Gyeong Un-cheon.

The lord of the Nine Dragons Clan and the absolute swordsman at the pinnacle of the Jianghu.

He sat on the throne, looking down at Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong.

Bu Yak-young knelt before Gyeong Un Cheon and spoke,

“At your command, lord, I have brought Lee Cheong and his father.”

“Leave us.”

“Yes!”

Bu Yak-young carefully stood up and retreated.

Only three people remained in the hall.

A strange silence enveloped the space.

Gyeong Un Cheon silently looked down at Lee Gwak, and Lee Gwak looked up at him.

Gyeong Un-cheon’s already intense gaze turned razor-sharp.

“I told him to bring me a decent talent, and he brought along a dragon. Who are you?”

“I… am Lee Gwak, Lord Gyeong.”

Lee Gwak had briefly considered giving him a false name, but decided to reveal his true name.

He felt it, if only for a fleeting moment, the sensation of Gyeong Un-cheon’s gaze piercing right through him.

It was similar to when he had first met Go Geom-wol.

It was clear that Gyeong Un-cheon had used some kind of profound technique to see through him, and his guess was correct.

“Sura blade Lee Gwak. It is you!”

Gyeong Un-cheon stood up.
