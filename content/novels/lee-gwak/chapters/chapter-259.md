“The bright red petals can’t last ten days, but the sharp pine needles stay green throughout all four seasons. What’s so important about appearance? The most important thing is an unwavering heart that remains unchanged for a lifetime.”

A woman was walking along, humming in a soft voice.

The woman, appearing to be in her late teens or early twenties, possessed an exceptionally beautiful appearance. Her sharp features, smooth facial contours, and fair skin met all the criteria of what one would call a beauty.

Among all her features, the most striking were her eyes. They seemed to contain all the wisdom of the world, exuding a mysterious aura that inspired reverence in those who looked at her.

Following behind her was an elderly man of large stature. He was a head taller than the average man, with broad shoulders, and carried an axe the size of an adult’s torso on his back.

If his hair hadn’t turned completely white, one could easily mistake him for a large man in his prime.

The elderly man followed the woman with his lips firmly sealed, but his sharp gaze gave him the aura of a wild beast.

Suddenly, he asked the woman, “Is he truly here?”

“Yes! The information I obtained through Hao Clan should be accurate.”

“Hmm.”

The old man furrowed his brow at her response, a clear sign of displeasure. The woman glanced back at him with a gentle smile.

“Why?”

“I just don’t understand why you have to go find him. And I’m not convinced he’ll be of any help.”

“He’ll be helpful.”

“But… never mind. I’m sure you know what you’re doing.”

Despite his words, the old man’s face remained discontented. Still, the woman didn’t offer him any harsh words. She understood his concern.

She lifted her head to look up at the sky.

It was a clear blue sky, spread out like an endless ocean, without a single cloud in sight. She couldn’t even remember the last time she had seen such a bright sky. That’s how busy her life had been.

It seemed like it had been a year since she had the leisure to walk along a mountain path like this. The tickling sensation of grass brushing against her feet only served to brighten her mood further.

The woman raised her sleeve to wipe the sweat from her forehead. The old man looked at her with concern.

“Shall we rest for a bit if you’re tired?”

“No, I’m fine. I’ve learned martial arts too, you know.”

“But…”

“You treat me like a child far too often.”

“That’s because you’re that important.”

The old man’s answer made the woman burst into a chuckle.

The woman had learned quite a bit of martial arts herself. Though she might be lacking compared to the top masters of the Jianghu, she was still more skilled than most. Despite knowing this, the old man treated her as if she were a delicate, fragile glass.

Though she understood his feelings, at times, it felt like a heavy burden weighing down on her chest.

Moments like these made her want to lean on someone. But there were only a few people in the world she could rely on, which made her even more determined to appear strong.

The woman, forcing a bright expression, pointed ahead.

“It looks like we’re almost there. I see the bear-shaped rock.”

In the direction she pointed, there was a huge rock shaped like a bear standing on two legs.

‘They said his residence would appear beyond that bear-shaped rock.’

Her steps quickened on their own.

The old man followed behind her, still looking displeased.

After passing the bear-shaped rock, they reached a basin nestled deep within the valley. A large waterfall cascaded down one side of the basin, forming a pond below.

The basin was filled with beautiful, rare flowers, creating a picturesque scene. In the center stood a small cottage.

In front of the hut sat a small table and chairs, with two people facing each other.

One was a woman in her late twenties or early thirties, and the other, a boy who looked around ten years old.

The woman was sewing a piece of leather, while the boy was engrossed in a book. From a distance, their harmony and happiness were evident.

Even from a distance, their harmonious appearance exuded a sense of happiness.

The old man narrowed his eyes and spoke.

“Are those the family members you mentioned? They don’t seem all that…”

Suddenly, he stopped. A cold gaze had just settled on him.

The woman sewing the leather had looked up to observe the old man and the woman.

There was still about two hundred jang (600 m.) distance between them—a distance at which most people could barely make out shapes, let alone faces. Yet the woman’s gaze seemed to penetrate the distance and reach the old man.

“Impressive.”

The old man’s eyes lit up with interest.

Sensing another’s gaze from such a distance indicated that the woman’s skill was anything but ordinary.

As the woman continued to stare in their direction, the boy reading the book followed suit and looked over at them as well.

“Let’s go.”

The young woman began to walk towards the hut where the woman and boy were, with the old man following close behind.

As they drew closer, the woman’s extraordinary appearance became more apparent.

She was just as beautiful as the young woman. The difference was that her features were more mature and her gaze deeper.

The woman put down the piece of leather on the table and stood up. The young woman greeted her first.

“Sorry for intruding. I’m Lim Sobo. Are you sister So Cheon?”

The young woman introducing herself was Lim Sobo.

The woman’s lips curved into a faint smile.

“Yes, I am. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Miss Sobo. I’m Han So cheon.”

The woman welcoming Lim Sobo was Han So-cheon.

Three years had changed a lot about Han So-cheon. The biggest change was that her once cold face now exuded warmth. Her gaze had become gentler and more serene.

Lim Sobo couldn’t help but be inwardly amazed.

‘She’s truly beautiful. It’s no wonder why Gwak Oraboni chose her.’

Lim Sobo knew Han So-cheon’s history as a member of the Hidden Blood Squad. However, this was her first time meeting her in person.

Suddenly, Lim Sobo’s gaze shifted to the boy standing next to Han So-cheon.

The boy, who looked about ten, had a face that seemed to blend half of Han So-cheon’s features with someone else they both knew.

“So, you’re Gwak Oraboni’s son?”

“Hello. I’m Lee Cheong.”

The boy, Lee Cheong, bowed politely to Lim Sobo.

Despite his young age, Lee Cheong carried himself with elegance.

Despite the curiosity he must have had about the unexpected visitors, he held back and merely observed them.

Lim Sobo’s eyes drifted toward the book on the table. When she saw the title, her eyes lit up.

“The Six Paths of Heavenly Strategy? You’re reading this already?”

The Six Paths of Heavenly Strategy was a book written by the renowned strategist Godly Sage about 400 years ago, containing tactics and human resource management strategies. However, it was extremely advanced, making it difficult for someone as young as this boy to fully grasp. Even Lim Sobo hadn’t read and understood it until she was fifteen.

Lee Cheong blushed.

“I’m not fully comprehending it yet. I’m just beginning to grasp the concepts.”

“That’s impressive enough. You’re quite the bright one,” she praised.

Lim Sobo’s compliment brought a shy smile to Lee Cheong’s face.

Despite his wisdom, he was only nine years old and, like any child, craved praise.

At that moment…

“Ahem!”

The old man behind Lim Sobo cleared his throat. Only then did Lim Sobo remember that she hadn’t introduced him.

“Oh, right. This is Elder Noya, the Nine Shadow Demon Master, Buk Ri-seong.”

The Nine Shadow Demon Master

Han So-cheonn’s expression hardened.

The old man, Buk Ri-seong, smiled.

“It seems you know of me.”

“How could I not know of the great Buk Ri-seong, one of the Eight Great Martial Artists? Han So-cheon pays her respects.”

Han So-cheon respectfully cupped her fists toward Buk Ri-seong, and Buk Ri-seong nodded with an arrogant expression, his hands clasped behind him.

The Eight Great Martial Artists were renowned as the supreme masters of martial arts, comparable to the Ten Overlords.

While they didn’t command vast forces like the Ten Overlords, their individual martial prowess was said to be no less formidable.

Buk Ri-seong, known as the Nine Shadow Demon Master, had a reputation for having a ruthless and unyielding nature, true to his nickname.

“I am honored,” he replied.

“The pleasure is mine. But what brings such a distinguished person to this remote mountain?”

“I came to meet your husband.”

“My husband?”

“The young lady said that he could be of great help to us. That’s why I’ve come here personally. Where is your husband?”

He’s gone up the mountain with our daughter.”

“The mountain? Then I suppose we’ll have to wait.”

“I apologize.”

“Hmph!”

Buk Ri-seong scowled, clearly unhappy with the prospect of having to wait.

Lim Sobo gave him a quick glare, pinching his side. But the old man didn’t hide his displeasure.

‘That’s why I should have brought Brother Cheon-wol instead.’

She thought of Cheon-wol, who had always stayed by her side, protecting her. But today, she couldn’t bring him along. Cheon-wol had pressing matters to attend to, so instead, she had to settle for Buk Ri-seong.

Buk Ri-seong, one of the Eight Great Martial Artists, was not accustomed to waiting. His displeasure was evident in his expression.

Han So-cheon, sensing Buk Ri-seong’s irritation, spoke calmly without the slightest sign of intimidation.

“My husband will be down shortly. Until then, why don’t you have some tea while you wait?”

“Khhm!”

“Thank you, Sister.”

Buk Ri-seong and Lim Sobo took their seats. Han So-cheon placed a small brazier and kettle on the table and began to boil water. As the water heated, she prepared tea leaves and cups.

“This is an herbal tea I picked and dried myself last autumn. It may not be the finest, but I hope you’ll enjoy it.”

Han So-cheon skillfully brewed the tea and served it to Lim Sobo and Buk Ri-seong.

“The aroma is wonderful.”

“Hmm!”

The faces of both Lim Sobo and Buk Ri-seong lit up with admiration. The flavor of the humble herbal tea exceeded their expectations.

‘It’s delightful.’

Lim Sobo clasped the teacup with both hands, nodding. The fragrance that lingered in her mouth filled her with happiness, and Buk Ri-seong seemed to share the sentiment.

Seeing them enjoy the tea brought a shadow over Han So-cheon’s face.

The past three years had matured Han So-cheon.

Her face used to be full of bitterness, driven by a fierce determination to survive. But her time here had softened her.

She no longer needed to harbor such thoughts or live desperately. Most necessities could be found in nature, and what couldn’t be obtained there could be bought in the nearby village.

It was a simple life, but it was paradise to her.

Han So-cheon had finally found the perfect life she had always dreamed of.

If only Lim Sobo and Buk Ri-seong hadn’t appeared.

Han So-cheon spoke up, “May I ask why you’re seeking my husband?”

“I’m sorry, Sister,” Lim Sobo replied.

“…”

“I don’t wish to disrupt your peaceful life, but we need all the help we can get. Especially from someone as skilled as your husband…”

Lim Sobo’s voice trailed off, her face filled with regret.

Though she had come out of necessity, she couldn’t shake the guilt of disrupting their happy life.

Han So-cheon inquired, “It seems the outside world is in turmoil.”

“Very much so,” Lim Sobo replied honestly.

The world was in chaos—beyond that, it was verging on pure disorder.

Three years ago, the Jade Heaven Alliance Leader, Ja Hong-cheon, declared a war against the Nine Sects.

The Jade Heaven Alliance swiftly destroyed the Zealous Justice Clan and the White Light Sect, seizing momentum. Two of the Nine Sects disappeared from Jianghu almost overnight.

Ja Hong-cheon turned his attention to the Myriad Merchant Troupe.

However, the Troupe, instead of fighting, vanished into the shadows, making it impossible for the Jade Heaven Alliance to engage them.

The Seven Sects fortified their defenses, and the war dragged on, causing massive casualties on both sides.

Lim Sobo had left the Jade Heaven Alliance and sought refuge with the Combined Forces of the Green Forest and the Sky High Castle. Her goal now was to persuade Lee Gwak to join their cause.

Suddenly, her face flushed with embarrassment.

‘Do I even have the right to disrupt their peace?’

At that moment…

“Father’s here.”

Lee Cheong’s voice cut through her thoughts.
