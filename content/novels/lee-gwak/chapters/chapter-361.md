“Young Master!”

“Lord Yong!”

Martial artists from the Jade Heaven Alliance rushed over to Yong Cheon-myeong. They pointed their swords at Lee Gwak while cradling Yong Cheon-myeong’s lifeless body.

“You demon”

“How dare you kill Young Master Yong?”

They glared at Lee Gwak as if he were their mortal enemy. In their eyes, fear and hostility coexisted. They feared Lee Gwak, yet they hated him with every fiber of their being.

For the martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance, Lee Gwak was a nightmare and someone they could never forgive as long as they lived under the same sky.

But even with their seething hatred, they couldn’t attack him recklessly. They had witnessed his incredible martial prowess first hand.

Even after killing the mighty Yong Cheon-myeong, the only wound Lee Gwak had was a minor one on his shoulder.

His martial prowess was so incredible that it was hard to believe unless you saw it with your own eyes.

The fact that so many of the martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance were reluctant to challenge him was a testament to the fear he inspired in them.

Then, a middle-aged martial artist stepped forward among them.

He wore ordinary clothes and had an ordinary face that could be seen anywhere, but his aura was extraordinary.

He approached Lee Gwak fearlessly.

Lee Gwak silently observed him.

The man performed a formal martial salute.

“I am Ha Gong-wol, deputy leader of the Heavenly Intelligence Hall, I greet Master Lee.”

“Heavenly Intelligence Hall?”

Interest sparked in Lee Gwak’s eyes.

The Heavenly Intelligence Hall was the intelligence arm of the Jade Heaven Alliance. Although it was not as extensive as the Hao Clan, it was reputed to have a superior intelligence quality.

The name Heavenly Intelligence Organisation was well-known, but the identities of its leader and deputy leader were top secret.

Very few people knew the true identities of their leader and deputy leader.

Even Go Jeon-ok, who usually spoke freely about others, strictly kept silent about their identities.

Ha Gong-wol looked at Yong Cheon-myeong’s body with a bitter expression.

Since Yong Cheon-myeong himself was leading this operation, Ha Gong-wol, as a top figure of the Heavenly Intelligence Hall, had come to support him.

He had rallied the Heavenly Intelligence Hall’s full intelligence capabilities to assist Yong Cheon-myeong.

Up until then, he had never doubted that the Jade Heaven Alliance would be victorious.

Since Yong Cheon-myeong himself was leading this operation, Ha Gong-wol, as a top figure of the Heavenly Intelligence Hall, had come to support him.

He had rallied the Heavenly Intelligence Hall’s full intelligence capabilities to assist Yong Cheon-myeong.

Up until then, he had never doubted that the Jade Heaven Alliance would be victorious.

He had destroyed the Taegang branch of the Hao clan, blinding the eyes and ears of the Dragon Heaven Valley and confusing them with false information.

He had been certain of the operation’s success—it had been executed flawlessly. But the operation failed, and they lost their First Young Master, Yong Cheon-myeong.

Everything was perfect.

But, they failed.

All because they couldn’t perfectly block Lee Gwak’s involvement.

‘I should have kept him further away.’

Shadows fell over Ha Gong-wol’s eyes.

He couldn’t believe that an operation mobilizing all of Jade Heaven Alliance’s capabilities failed because of just one person. But after seeing the whole process, he couldn’t deny it.

With Yong Cheon-myeong dead, there was no point in continuing the operation.

It was time to retreat.

“I would like to collect the bodies and withdraw. May I have your permission?”

He asked Lee Gwak, not Dragon Heaven Valley, for permission.

The Dragon Heaven Valley had lost all their forces in the Hundred Eyes Fortress, so they were no longer his negotiating partners.

He only feared and watched Lee Gwak. That’s why he asked for his permission.

Lee Gwak looked at Ha Gong-wol silently for a moment.

A flicker of anxiety crossed Ha Gong-wol’s face. If Lee Gwak refused, then they would have no choice but to fight him with everything they had.

Against just one individual.

It was highly inefficient, and even if they won, it wouldn’t be a glorious victory.

He felt the sweat on his palms.

Everything hinged on Lee Gwak’s answer.

Finally, Lee Gwak spoke.

“Go ahead.”

“Thank… you.”

Ha Gong-wol let out a faint sigh.

A look of relief flashed across his face.

As an intelligence officer, Ha Gong-wol was not one to show his emotions easily, but the situation was tense enough for him to reveal his true feelings.

Ha Gongwol turned to the martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

“Gather the body of the First Master and the fallen. We’re retreating.”

“But…”

Some of the Jade Heaven Alliance martial artists expressed their discontent.

Ha Gong-wol glared at them.

“What, do you intend to fight to the death?”

“…”

“If you’re so eager to fight him, I won’t stop you. Go ahead and challenge him yourselves.”

“That’s…”

As the martial artists hesitated, Ha Gong-wol snorted dismissively. “Hmph! You dare talk big when you lack the courage to act?”

“We… apologize.”

They eventually bowed their heads.

The Jade Heaven Alliance martial artists prepared to retreat without further protest.

However, it was now the martial artists of Dragon Heaven Valley who raised their voices.

“Grand Master Lee! You can’t just let them go.”

“They’ve killed so many of our comrades. We must avenge them by slaughtering every last one of them.”

Their anger, fueled by the heavy losses they had suffered in the joint attack by the Martial Sword Troupe and Yong Cheon-myeong’s forces, was palpable. They glared at the Jade Heaven Alliance warriors with venomous eyes.

Lee Gwak’s gaze turned to Mok Seon-wol.

“What do you think?”

“Let them… go.”

Mok Seon-wol’s unexpected response drew protests from the martial artists of Dragon Heaven Valley.

“Young Mistress!”

“We can’t let them go.”

“Do you think you can defeat them if we fight? Grand Master Lee is not one of us. It’s too much to ask him to fight any further.”

“But…”

“Don’t force Grand Master Lee to sacrifice more for us. We’ll avenge ourselves with our own strength.”

Mok Seon-wol’s firm words silenced the martial artists of Dragon Heaven Valley.

It wasn’t as if she wanted to let the Jade Heaven Alliance martial artists go . If she could, she would have settled the score with them right then and there. But for now, dealing with the aftermath took priority over continuing the fight.

Mok Seon-wol clenched her teeth so hard that blood trickled from her gums, but she felt no pain.

The sight of her resolve left the martial artists of Dragon Heaven Valley speechless.

At that moment—

Crash!

A loud noise echoed as someone tumbled to the ground.

It was Woo Mun-pae, young master of the Martial Sword Troupe.

He had deep wounds to his side and shoulder, severe enough that bone was visible. A hair’s breadth more, and he might have lost his life on the spot.

Woo Mun Pae struggled, but he had no strength in his body.

“Gurgh!”

Sa Yeon-hee walked up to him.

Blood dripped from her sword. It was Woo Mun Pae’s blood.

“It’s useless.”

“What?”

“The martial arts of the Sword Sect, which you so arrogantly dismissed, are the natural counter to all the techniques of the Martial Sword Troupe.”

“What?”

“The founder of the Martial Sword Troupe, fearing that the sect might stray from the right path, left behind the Sword Sect, which contained the principles to counter all the martial arts of the Martial Sword Troupe.”

“How…?”

Woo Mun-pae’s jaw dropped.

Sa Yeon-hee’s words were true.

She was not the greatest martial artist in the world. She could not compare to the supreme masters of the Nine Sects, let alone the Eight Great Martial Artists. Perhaps one day she might reach their level, but not yet. Even so, she was confident she could subdue Woo Mun-pae.

This was because the martial arts techniques left behind by the Martial Sword Troupe’s founder, Hae So-wol, in the Sword Fragment were the natural counter to all of the Martial Sword Troupe’s techniques.

Woo Mun-pae’s body trembled.

Rage and humiliation consumed him. He wanted to rise and challenge Sa Yeon-hee again, but his body wouldn’t move. He realized the truth in her words.

No matter how many times he tried, the result would be the same.

His body had been broken first, and now his spirit was shattered.

Woo Mun-pae hung his head in defeat.

Sa Yeon-hee watched Woo unpae for a moment before turning her gaze to Mok Seon-wol.

“I’m sorry. I will definitely pay for the misdeeds committed by Martial Sword Troupe. Please give me a little time.”

“What are you planning to do?”

“I will hold the league leader accountable.”

“Is that possible?”

“It is.”

Sa Yeon-hee’s response was firm.

It might not have been possible under normal circumstances, but now it was. Even if it wasn’t, she would make it possible.

Mok Seon-wol felt the determination in Sa Yeon-hee’s resolve.

Mok Seon-wol performed a martial salute to Sa Yeon-hee and said, “I pray that Miss Sa’s intentions are fulfilled. Otherwise, I will personally lead the elite of Dragon Heaven Valley to visit the Martial Sword Troupe.”

“That will never happen.”

Sa Yeon-hee returned the salute.

She did not forget to express her gratitude to Lee Gwak as well.

“Thank you for your help, Grand master Lee. Without you, a greater tragedy could have occurred, and the Martial Sword Troupe might have become sinners for eternity. I will definitely repay this kindness.”

“I hope you manage your internal affairs well.”

“Thank you. Until we meet again, I wish you well.”

Sa Yeon-hee left the battlefield with the Martial Sword Troupe warriors.

With their departure, the battlefield felt emptier.

Now it was the Jade Heaven Alliance’s turn.

The Jade Heaven Alliance warriors, having hastily collected the bodies, retreated like a receding tide.

Like defeated soldiers, they walked away with their shoulders slumped.

The warriors of Dragon Heaven Valley watched their retreating figures with bloodshot eyes. The fact that they could not attack and behead them immediately was unbearably frustrating. But for now, they had to endure.

“Ugh…”

“I will never… never forget today’s humiliation.”

Some wept, while others vowed revenge.

Mok Seon-wol, with a devastated expression, approached Lee Gwak.

“Great Hero Lee!”

“Speak.”

“I sincerely thank you for your help. I wish I could repay you immediately, but as you can see, the situation…”

“Please don’t concern yourself with it. I didn’t do it expecting repayment.”

“Even so, I can’t let it go. Would you mind staying in Taegang for a few days? Once we’ve sorted things out, I will definitely come to see you.”

With Mok Seon-wol’s insistence, Lee Gwak could no longer refuse.

He nodded.

“I will do so.”

“Thank you. I will see you again soon.”

Mok Seon-wol saluted Lee Gwak and left.

She rallied the survivors to manage the aftermath. Lee Gwak watched for a moment before walking away.

He headed to where Seok Yi-cheon and the surviving members of the Outer Hall were gathered.

“Gwak-ah!”

Seok Yi-cheon grabbed Lee Gwak’s hand, and the Outer Hall martial artists gathered around him.

Even though the Jade Heaven Alliance warriors had all left, they had stayed behind, waiting for Lee Gwak.

“Is everyone alright?”

“We’re fine. What about you?”

“I’m fine too.”

“That’s a relief. Truly a relief.”

Seok Yi-cheon’s eyes welled up with tears.

Go Cheon-gwang and Woo Il-yeong felt the same.

They were as joyful as if they had reunited with their own flesh and blood. But they couldn’t fully share in the joy because they had lost so many comrades.

The ones who suffered the most in this battle were the Outer Hall martial artists.

Over a dozen groups had come here, but only about thirty members survived.

Since Seok Yi-cheon joined the Outer Hall, they had never suffered such losses.

It was the worst possible situation.

At that moment, someone quietly approached Lee Gwak, Seok Yi-cheon, and the others.

It was Ha Gong-wol, the Vice Leader of the Cheonidang.

While most of the Jade Heaven Alliance warriors had left, he had stayed behind.

Lee Gwak silently observed Ha Gong-wol. Ha Gong-wol smiled bitterly and said, “I mean no harm, so there’s no need to be on guard. Of course, I couldn’t do anything to you even if I wanted to. I just came to make a proposal.”

“A proposal?”

“Would you consider returning to the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

“Are you serious?”

“I am. After all, you were once part of the Jade Heaven Alliance, weren’t you? If you return, the Alliance Leader will forgive you for killing Young Master Yong. He only values ability and results.”

“I refuse.”

“I expected as much…”

Ha Gong-wol wasn’t disappointed.

He hadn’t truly expected Lee Gwak to accept his proposal.

His gaze shifted to the Outer Hall martial artists standing with Lee Gwak.

“What are you all doing here? Why haven’t you rejoined the main force?”

His real target was the Outer Hall martial artists with Lee Gwak.

Although they had lost the battle, the Jade Heaven Alliance still held the power of life and death over the Outer Hall martial artists.

He intended to take Seok Yi-cheon and the Outer Hall martial artists back to pressure Lee Gwak.

At that moment, Seok Yi-cheon stepped forward.

He threw his sword in front of Ha Gong-wol and spoke, “As of today, I am no longer a martial artist of the Jade Heaven Alliance. So don’t order me around.”

Clang!

The clear sound of metal echoed across the battlefield, and Ha Gong-wol’s expression twisted unpleasantly.
