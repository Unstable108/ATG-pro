“Gah!”

“My… my ears…!”

Outside the cave, the martial artists writhed in pain, clutching their ears as the man’s manic laughter sent shockwaves through their meridians.

They tried to block out the sound with their internal energy, but it was futile. Their eardrums tore and blood poured out. Soon, their meridians ruptured one after another.

They screamed in agony as if they were in hell.

Even Lee Gwak was not spared. The laughter pierced his mind, sending waves of pain through him. But he had the Eight Snakes Art

As the laughter assaulted his veins, the great serpent within him awakened, shielding his body from inside. Thanks to this, Lee Gwak remained steady and fixed his gaze on the madman.

Surprised by Lee Gwak’s composure, the man stopped laughing and stared back.

“You’re no ordinary one. With that strength, you could rival Geomwol.”

“Geom Wol? Are you referring to Go Geom-wol?”

“That’s right. The wicked disciple who left his master in this wretched state and locked him here.”

“Hmm!”

Lee Gwak exhaled sharply.

Now, he understood the madman’s identity.

There was only one person in the world who could call Go Geom-wol his disciple.

“You are the Lord of the Celestial Demon Troupe.”

“Correct. I am Jin Gwang-hon, the master of the Celestial Demon Troupe.”

Jin Gwang-hon’s booming voice echoed throughout the hall.

Lee Gwak swallowed hard.

The Solitary Divine Demon, Jin Gwang-hon.

Former master of the Celestial Demon Troupe, and the mentor of Go Geom Wol.

Amidst the fierce war between the Celestial Demon Troupe and the Jade Heaven Alliance, he had vanished without a trace, leaving many to wonder about his whereabouts. Even the Hao Clan’s intelligence network had failed to locate him. No one could have guessed he was imprisoned in the Endless Prison.

‘Did Go Geom-wol defeat his own master and lock him away here?’

Lee Gwak’s expression hardened like stone.

For a disciple to subdue and imprison his master violated the natural order. No matter the justification, the world would never approve of such an act.

Especially since the perpetrator was Go Geom-wol, the Young Master of the Celestial Demon Troupe, who was already despised by the world. No excuse could justify his actions.

Now, Lee Gwak understood why the Celestial Demon Troupe had built this Endless Prison in Mount Kongtong.

Go Geom-wol couldn’t bring himself to kill his master, so he sealed him away with powerful restrictions instead.

To Go Geom-wol, this was a shameful secret that must never be exposed.

This explained why Gu Mun-hye had gone to such lengths to drive Lee Gwak there; she sought to protect the secret from being revealed to the world.

Jin Gwang-hon spoke again.

“You still haven’t answered. Who are you?”

“My name is Lee Gwak.”

“Lee Gwak? The one they call the ‘Sura Blade’? The rising name of the Jianghu?”

“That’s right.”

“Then why are you here? Are you connected to Go Geom-wol?”

“I have no ties to him.”

“Then why are you here?”

“That’s…”

“You think I don’t know you’re all in league? Hmph!”

Madness flickered in Jin Gwang-hon’s eyes.

Go Geom-wol hadn’t had the heart to kill his master, but their battle had left Jin Gwang-hon with a severe head injury.

Since then, his mind had begun to waver, and frequent bouts of insanity had consumed him. The heat of the lava only worsened his condition, making it nearly impossible for him to think clearly.

“Did Geom-wol send you to kill me? Me!?”

“No, he didn’t.”

“Silence! Do you think I’ll be fooled again? Never!”

Jin Gwang-hon stretched his hand toward the iron gate. A terrifying suction force erupted, pulling the unconscious martial artists into the cave.

The collapsed men were dragged and stacked neatly before Jin Gwang-hon.

“Heh heh! Geom-wol, you underestimated me. You thought you’d reduced me to a cripple, but I still have endless methods left.”

With a sinister laugh, Jin Gwang-hon placed his hand on the head of one of the martial artists.

Schlllp!

A strange sucking sound echoed as the man’s body shriveled under his touch.

He was absorbing the man’s life force.

“The… Soul-Devouring Art?”

Lee Gwak’s eyes widened in recognition.

It was a forbidden martial art of the demonic path that stole the lifeblood of others to replenish the user’s vitality and internal energy.

It had been lost for centuries, with no known practitioners in the modern era. Yet, Jin Gwang-hon had mastered it.

Won Mu-ak, who had been dragged into the cave earlier, had already been drained of his lifeblood and left lifeless.

“Stop this!”

“Heh heh!”

Lee Gwak’s shout fell on deaf ears.

In an instant, Jin Gwang-hon drained the martial artists of their lifeblood.

His mad eyes grew even more ferocious. By absorbing the lifeblood of Won Mu-ak and the other warriors, he had partially restored his damaged True Origin Qi.

Jin Gwang-hon’s body began to levitate.

With his immense internal energy, he floated in midair, which was a necessity since both his legs had been severed below the knees.

With killing intent in his voice, he spoke to Lee Gwak,

“Once I drain your lifeblood, punishing Geom-wol will no longer be an impossible task.”

To Jin Gwang-hon, Lee Gwak was nothing more than a delectable prey.

He stretched his hand toward Lee Gwak.

“Come here.”

A monstrous suction force pulled Lee Gwak toward him.

Lee Gwak didn’t resist.

He knew there was no escaping this place without defeating Jin Gwang-hon first.

Instead, he used the suction force to propel himself toward Jin Gwang-hon at blinding speed.

Swish!

His blade struck out faster than an arrow.

BOOOOM!

The colossal cave trembled violently as the two clashed.

The chains binding Jin Gwang-hon rattled, and the rocks sealing the lava pool shook ominously.

Rumble!

“What was that?!”

Lee Soo-ah and Ki Jin-hwi exchanged startled glances as a violent tremor shook the ground below them.

“An earthquake?”

The intense vibrations made it seem as though Mount Kongtong itself was groaning in pain.

“Something’s happening down there.”

Seo Jong-myeong’s eyes trembled rapidly as he leaned on Ki Jin-hwi’s shoulder.

Lee Soo-ah and Seo Jong-myeong had safely escaped the endless prison during the chaos and reunited with Ki Jin-hwi.

They had faced danger several times, but thanks to Soo-ah’s quick thinking and Seo’s tactical guidance, they managed to survive.

“What’s going on underground?” Lee Soo-ah asked with a fearful expression.

“…”

Seo Jong-myeong and Ki Jin-hwi couldn’t answer.

Their bodies were covered in goosebumps and their senses were overwhelmed. They could barely stand; their stomachs churned as if they were about to vomit and their limbs shook uncontrollably.

They were both exceptional martial artists who had forged their own paths through martial arts and sorcery. Yet even they felt their veins tear under the terrifying qi waves emanating from the underground cave.

Lee Soo-ah, being less sensitive due to her lower level, didn’t fully grasp the scale; she just felt an ominous fear.

But Seo Jong-myeong and Ki Jin-hwi knew.

They could sense that a battle far beyond their comprehension was raging deep under their feet.

“Gwak is fighting the Solitary Divine Demon.”

“The Solitary Divine Demon… You mean Jin Gwang-hon, the former leader of the Celestial Demon Troupe?”

At Ki Jin-hwi’s question, Seo Jong-myeong nodded silently.

Though the cells of the Endless Prison were thoroughly isolated, Seo Jong-myeong had overheard the guards whispering about Jin Gwang-hon’s imprisonment.

Rumble!

The mountain seemed to scream in protest.

Just then, a group emerged from the entrance of the Endless Prison.

They wore leather robes and hats that concealed their entire bodies.

Ki Jin-hwi recognized them instantly.

“The Saintess and her guards.”

The women in leather robes were none other than Gu Mun-hye and her Moonlight Six Fairies. Though their numbers had dwindled to five after Jin Ryeong’s death, Ki Jin-hwi knew who they were at a glance.

Thud!

At that moment, Seo Jong-myeong clenched his fists so tightly that his palms bled. He looked ready to charge forward.

Ki Jin-hwi grabbed his shoulder, pressing him down.

Weakened from his long imprisonment, Seo Jong-myeong couldn’t resist Ki Jin-hwi’s strength.

Ki Jin-hwi pulled Seo Jong-myeong behind a collapsed wall, hiding them both. Lee Soo-ah, quick-witted as ever, darted after them like a squirrel.

Seo Jong-myeong shot Ki Jin-hwi a resentful look, but Ki Jin-hwi was firm.

‘The Saintess and the remaining six fairies are too strong. We can’t handle them as we are now.’

Having been chased by Jin Ryeong, the first of the Moonlight fairies, Ki Jin-hwi knew the others were nearly as formidable.

One of them was exhausted from the long pursuit, another had been imprisoned with his martial arts sealed, and the last was just a child.

With their current strength, they stood no chance.

If discovered, they’d either be slaughtered on the spot or captured instantly.

Ki Jin-hwi held his breath, watching Gu Mun-hye.

Suddenly, Gu Moon-hye’s gaze turned toward the place where Ki Jin-hwi and the others were hiding.

The second maiden, Oh Cho-hye, asked curiously, “What’s wrong?”

“I just felt someone watching.”

“I’ll check.”

Oh Cho-hye dashed toward the collapsed wall.

After inspecting the area, she shook her head at Gu Mun-hye.

“There’s nothing here.”

“Are you sure?”

Oh Cho-hye scanned the surroundings with sharp eyes but detected nothing unusual.

“Yes! Not even an ant in sight.”

“I must be overly sensitive. Come back.”

“Understood.”

Oh Cho-hye returned to Gu Mun-hye’s side.

Rumble!

Another violent tremor shook the mountain.

Gu Mun-hye’s expression darkened.

‘Are they still fighting?’

Even if Jin Gwang-hon was severely weakened from his imprisonment, he was still the former leader of the Celestial Demon Troupe.

The fact that Lee Gwak was still holding his own against him was astonishing.

“No wonder Geom-wol considers him a lifelong rival.”

Gu Mun-hye bit her lip.

Blood trickled from the wound, but she didn’t even feel the pain.

Her heart pounded with dread.

She feared it might burst out of her chest, but she had no time to dwell on such trivial fears.

Oh Cho-hye asked, “What should we do?”

“Seal the Endless Prison.”

“But then everyone inside will…”

“We have no choice. If either of those two escapes, the Celestial Demon Troupe will suffer a devastating blow.”

“Saintess…?”

“I will bear all the disgrace. The world’s curses, Geom-wol’s resentment, I’ll endure it all. Seal it.”

“Sigh… Understood.”

Oh Cho-hye reluctantly agreed.

The endless prison was designed to be an inescapable hell, a place one could enter but never leave.

Once sealed, no one inside could escape. Mechanisms would lock the entrance and ventilation shafts, ensuring that no one could break free without external help.

The prison was built for the worst-case scenario, but Gu Mun-hye never imagined she would have to use it so soon.

At her command, the sixth fairy, Cho Yu-seon, activated the mechanism.

Clunk!

The sound of gears turning echoed from inside.

Once the prison was fully sealed, Gu Mun-hye addressed the Moonlight Fairies.

“Let’s go.”

“Yes!”

Gu Mun-hye and the five Moonlight Fairies departed with heavy steps.

Their figures soon disappeared from Mount Kongtong.

Moments later, Ki Jin-hwi and the others emerged from behind the ruined wall.

“Phew… We survived.”

It wasn’t because Oh Cho-hye was careless; Ki Jin-hwi had used every ounce of his strength to cast a spell and obscure their presence.

His already injured body felt like it was melting, but he had no time to dwell on it.

“They sealed the prison? Then what about Gwak?”

He stared blankly at the Endless Prison.

Lee Gwak was still trapped inside.

“How ruthless! There are still Celestial Demon Troupe members in there!”

Seo Jong-myeong scowled with rage.

She was the Saintess.

Yet she had chosen such a ruthless path.

If the world knew, Gu Mun-hye would be harshly condemned.

But that was not the issue now.

Lee Gwak was still inside.

They had to save Lee Gwak, still trapped inside the Endless Prison.

Their gazes turned to Lee Soo-ah.

They feared the young girl might be shaken, but surprisingly, her expression was calm.

“Su-ah!”

“Dad will be fine.”

“But the prison has been sealed…”

“You said it was locked by mechanisms, right? Did you forget? After blades, the thing Dad is best at in the world is dealing with mechanisms.”

“Ah!”

“He’ll definitely come out safely. He just needs a little time. I believe in him.”

Lee Soo-ah’s eyes shone with unwavering conviction.
