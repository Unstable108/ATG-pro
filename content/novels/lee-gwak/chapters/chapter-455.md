“Hehe!”

Lee Soo-ah clung to Lee Gwak’s side and laughed continuously.

Lee Gwak stroked Lee Soo-ah’s head and asked,

“Are you that happy?”

“Yeah! It’s been so long since I’ve spent time with Dad.”

A faint smile appeared on Lee Gwak’s lips at her words, but his expression soon darkened.

The current Jianghu was not safe enough for him to wander around comfortably with his daughter.

The war between the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Celestial Demon Troupe had intensified day by day, plunging the Jianghu into chaos.

Except for the Dragon Valley, the Seven Great Sects had yet to join the war, but no one could predict when the flames of war would spread to them.

If even one of them entered the conflict, the Jianghu would become a true hell.

The Mad Martial Sect was preparing for that possibility, but the reality was that they were still far from ready.

As a deep shadow fell over Lee Gwak’s face, Lee Soo-ah patted his hand.

“Huh? What’s wrong?”

“Don’t worry.”

“What?”

“Your face is full of worry.”

“Is that so?”

“Yeah! Worrying won’t solve anything, you know. So, I don’t want you to live with all that anxiety weighing you down.”

“Haha!”

Lee Gwak burst into laughter at her words

She blinked her big eyes in surprise.

“What? Is what I said funny?”

“No, I’m just grateful.”

“Really?”

“Yeah. You’re better than me, Soo-ah. Thanks to you, my worries have disappeared.”

“That’s a relief. Heehee!”

Lee Soo-ah giggled happily.

Lee Gwak looked at her with tender eyes.

Lee Cheong had a dependable charm, but Lee Soo-ah had a way of brightening his mood just by being there.

He didn’t favor one child over the other, but in terms of sheer parenting delight, she definitely brought more of it.

Lee Soo-ah snuggled up to Lee Gwak and gazed at the passing scenery.

They were currently traveling by boat.

Once they reached the lower reaches of the river, they planned to buy horses nearby and continue to their destination.

Lee Soo-ah couldn’t hide her excitement at being out after so long, and seeing her like that made Lee Gwak smile too.

He suddenly felt glad he had brought her along.

Lee Soo-ah was full of curiosity and passion.

She wanted to see everything in the world with her own eyes.

In contrast, Lee Cheong was intelligent and well-read, preferring quiet contemplation over traveling. Of course, that didn’t mean he disliked going out, it was just his nature.

That’s why he hadn’t looked too disappointed when Lee Gwak said he was only taking Lee Soo-ah.

Lee Gwak asked her,

“How are things with Jin-ui and So-hye?”

“Great!”

“Great?”

“Yeah! Jin-ui oppa is thoughtful, and So-hye unni always puts others before herself. Plus, they’re really considerate of me and Cheong.”

“In what way?”

“Well, because we’re Dad’s children. They can’t help but be mindful of us, right?”

Pee Jin-ui and Jo So-hye were Lee Gwak’s first disciples.

In other sects, being the sect leader’s disciple would naturally place them in the line of succession, but the Mad Martial Sect was different. Lee Gwak’s children, Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah, existed.

No matter how hard Pee Jin-ui and Jo So-hye worked, the presence of the sect leader’s children meant they had no chance of becoming successors.

Fortunately, neither of them ever dreamed of becoming the next sect leader. Instead, they had already made it clear they would support Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah.

Lee Gwak asked Lee Soo-ah,

“Do you want to be the sect leader?”

“No!”

She shook her head firmly.

“Why not?”

“It’s a headache! That kind of complicated stuff isn’t for me. Cheong would be much better at it. I just want to live freely like I do now. Is that okay?”

“Of course.”

“Heehee!”

Lee Soo-ah smiled sweetly.

Lee Gwak didn’t believe the Mad Martial Sect had to be passed down to his children. Anyone qualified could become the next leader.

If Lee Cheong wanted the position, he could take it, but if not, Pee Jin-ui, Jo So-hye, or another talented individual could succeed him.

Lost in thought, Lee Gwak gazed at the passing scenery.

As the boat neared the lower reaches of the river, the banks widened, revealing vast reed fields. And countless birds soared above them.

Flap! Flap!

Thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands of birds took flight all at once, creating a breathtaking spectacle.

“Wow!”

Gasps erupted from all around.

Against the backdrop of the setting sun, the flock of birds swirled and danced, leaving the onlookers in awe.

“Whoa!”

Lee Soo-ah’s mouth hung open in amazement.

“Winter’s nearing. The birds must be gathering to find food.”

Someone offered an explanation.

Lee Gwak ignored the comment and was absorbed in the magnificent sight.

Whatever the reason, such a display was rare. Even Lee Gwak, who had traveled the Jianghu for years, had never seen anything like it.

“Incredible.”

“It’s so beautiful. I’m going to travel the world and see sights like this whenever I want.”

Lee Soo-ah’s face was flushed with excitement.

Lee Gwak patted her head.

“I’m sure you will.”

“Heehee!”

Soon, the birds’ dance subsided.

The massive flock vanished as quickly as it had appeared, as though it had all been a dream.

Peace returned to the riverbank, but the memory lingered vividly in everyone’s minds.

They buzzed with excitement, recalling what they had just witnessed. The boat soon resembled a bustling market.

Soo-ah motioned to Lee Gwak that they should go to their cabin.

He nodded, and the two went inside together.

Thud!

Finally, the boat docked at their destination.

Lee Gwak and Soo-ah disembarked, holding hands.

It was already late in the afternoon, so leaving the village right away was unrealistic.

They decided to buy horses and stay at an inn for the night.

Luckily, there was a horse market on the village outskirts, so securing horses wasn’t difficult.

After buying two horses, they sought out the largest inn in town.

“Welcome!”

As they arrived, a young attendant around Soo-ah’s age came running out.

Lee Gwak handed him the reins and asked,

“Do you have any rooms?”

“Of course!”

“Give us your cleanest and largest room. One with two beds.”

“Yes! We have just the right room, so don’t worry.”

“We have a long journey ahead, so feed the horses plenty of oats and grain. I’ll pay separately, so don’t hold back.”

“Understood.”

The attendant looked especially sharp and clever.

Curious, Lee Gwak asked,

“What’s your name?”

“My name?”

“Yes.”

“It’s Cheon Man-geum(Ten Million Gold).”

Pfft!

Lee Su-ah couldn’t hold back her laughter.

A typical person might have taken offense, but Cheon Mang-geum remained unfazed.

“Hehe! I know my name’s a bit odd. My father gave it to me, hoping I’d become rich one day.”

“Sorry! I didn’t mean to laugh at you.”

“No offense taken.”

“I hope you do become rich, just like your name.”

“Thank you, miss! Even if it’s just polite words, I appreciate it.”

“It’s not just polite. I really think you will.”

His eyes flickered for a moment.

Working at the inn, he had seen countless guests, but none had ever said anything like that to him.

“Thank you, miss! May I ask your name? If not, that’s okay too.”

“My name’s Lee Soo-ah.”

She answered without hesitation.

Cheon Man-geum repeated her name silently before breaking into a bright smile.

“It’s a beautiful name. I’ll never forget it.”

“Oh, you don’t have to go that far…”

“I’ll take good care of your horses.”

Cheon Man-geum led the horses away with quick steps.

Lee Soo-ah watched him go and murmured,

“He’s an interesting kid.”

“Let’s go inside.”

They entered the inn and were given the best available room.

Lee Soo-ah said to Lee Gwak,

“I’m going to wash up first, so order something to eat.”

“Alright.”

“I’ll be back soon.”

She took her belongings and went upstairs.

Left alone, Lee Gwak looked around the first floor before settling by the window.

Cheon Man-geum, who had just stabled the horses, approached and asked,

“What would you like to eat?”

“What’s the specialty here?”

“Our stir-fried pork with vegetables is famous.”

The dish involved boiling pork, slicing it thin, and stir-frying it with various vegetables.

“Then bring that, two beef noodle soups, and a bottle of wine.”

“Right away.”

Cheon Man-geum hurried to the kitchen.

Left alone again, Lee Gwak gazed out the window, lost in thought, though not for long.

“Hey! Is anyone here?”

The door burst open and a group of people came in.

A middle-aged man in his late forties, a young boy who appeared to be his son, and four armed escorts entered the inn with an air of arrogance.

They ignored the other guests and shouted loudly for attention.

“We’re coming!”

Cheon Mang-geum, who had just delivered the order, ran over.

The middle-aged man frowned as he scrutinized the boy’s shabby appearance and the smell clinging to him.

He pinched his nose and waved dismissively.

“Stop. Don’t come any closer. Speak from there.”

“Huh? Oh, yes!”

Cheon Man-geum was momentarily taken aback but quickly regained his composure.

This wasn’t the first time he’d been treated this way.

“Will you be staying the night?”

“Yes. Give us your best room and separate rooms for my escorts.”

“I’m afraid our best rooms are already taken.”

“What?”

“All that’s left are two six-person rooms. Would those do?”

Six-person rooms were cramped, with barely enough space for one person, let alone six. They were cheap and shabby, usually used by merchants or low-ranking martial artists looking to save money, hardly suitable for someone of the man’s status.

The middle-aged man’s face twisted in disgust.

“Are you suggesting I sleep in a pigsty?”

“But those are the only rooms left…”

“Insolent brat!”

Thwack!

Without warning, the man kicked Cheon Man-geum in the chest.

The boy was sent flying, crashing to the ground without even a cry.

“How dare you talk back to me? And where’s the owner? Hiding like a coward?”

His voice echoed through the inn.

Finally, the innkeeper, who had been hiding, rushed out in a panic.

Sir, what seems to be the matter? I don’t know what angered you, but the boy meant no offense. He’s just an uneducated worker, please forgive him.”

“Enough! Just give me a proper room. If you don’t, I’ll tear this whole place apart.”

“Understood. Please calm down. There is a detached annex under renovation. I’ll give you that one. It’s not fully repaired yet, but it should be fine for one night.”

“Hmph! Should’ve said that from the start.”

With that, the fury on the man’s face finally faded.

He sat down at an empty table, ignoring the boy who was still lying on the floor.

The innkeeper, watching the man’s mood carefully, didn’t even dare to help the boy up.

That’s when a clear voice rang out through the inn.

“Are you okay?”

A gentle hand reached out to help the boy up. It was Lee Soo-ah.
