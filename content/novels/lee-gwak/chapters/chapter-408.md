Namgung Yeonhwa gave a fist salute to Lee Gwak.

“It’s been a while, Great Hero Lee!”

“Have you been well, Lady Namgung?”

“Thanks to you, I’ve been doing well. Soho has also become much more stable now.”

“That’s a relief.”

“I didn’t expect to meet you here again like this. Are you also attending the Wudang Sect’s opening ceremony?”

“That’s correct.”

Since there was no reason to hide it, Lee Gwak nodded.

Namgung Yeon-hwa beamed at his response.

“That’s great. Our Thousand Kingdom School was invited as well…”

“Then I suppose you’re leading the delegation?”

“My uncle came with me.”

“Your uncle?”

Just then—

“That would be me.”

A booming voice rang out as a middle-aged man with a fierce appearance appeared on the deck of the Thousand Kingdom School’s ship.

Lee Gwak recognized him at a glance.

Namgung Hoe – the deputy leader of the Thousand Kingdom School and the master of the Cloud Sword Hall, the strongest institution within the Thousand Kingdom School.

Namgung Hoe lightly leaped and landed beside Namgung Yeon-hwa.

His eyes were sharp and piercing, like those of a tiger.

Ordinary people would find their knees weak just meeting such a gaze. But even in the face of such fierce eyes, Lee Gwak showed no sign of being shaken.

“It’s been a while, Great Hero Namgung!”

“To think you’d come here as well. What a surprise.”

“I was invited, after all.”

At Lee Gwak’s response, Namgung Hoe bit his lip silently.

He hesitated for a moment, unsure how to treat Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak was no longer the man he once was.

Even after the great fire in Soho, he had defeated countless masters, and his fame now soared to the heavens.

His reputation had even surpassed that of the Thousand Kingdom School.

No matter how much Namgung Hoe disliked Lee Gwak, he could no longer treat him carelessly as he had in the past.

In the Jianghu, fame equated to strength—and Lee Gwak’s fame was beyond Namgung Hoe’s control.

Displaying the power of one’s sect or status meant nothing before a master like Igwak.

A single individual could possess power equal to an entire sect.

Namgung Hoe knew this, though he didn’t want to admit it.

It was the pride of a martial artist born and raised in a prestigious sect refusing to acknowledge a dragon born from a humble stream.

Hmph! Enjoy the moment while you can. That dazzling fame of yours won’t last much longer.

Namgung Hoe’s gaze turned cold.

Lee Gwak didn’t miss the contempt in his eyes, but he showed no reaction.

His mental discipline had already reached a level where such things couldn’t shake him. In terms of sheer mental fortitude, few in the world could match him.

With a composed expression, Lee Gwak asked,

“It seems the leader of your sect isn’t coming?”

“Our chief isn’t so idle as to come here. I’ve been given full authority. Or do you think I’m not enough?”

“Of course not. I was simply curious.”

“Hmph.”

Though he tried to maintain manners, Namgung Hoe’s tone remained curt.

Watching Namgung Hoe’s behavior, Namgung Yeon-hwa fidgeted uncomfortably.

Lee Gwak was not someone to be treated so dismissively. Seeing him constantly treated like a subordinate was uncomfortable to witness.

Just as Namgung Yeonhwa was about to say something to Namgung Hoe—

Lee Gwak spoke first.

“It was good to see you, Lady Namgung. Then, I’ll see you again at the Mount Hua Sect.”

It was a polite farewell.

Namgung Yeon-hwa replied weakly,

“Yes!”

She then leaped back to her ship.

Namgung Hoe glanced at Lee Gwak one last time before following her without even a word of farewell.

Creak…

The Thousand Kingdom School’s ship soon distanced itself from the Jeongong Escort Agency’s vessel, cutting powerfully through the water. Lee Gwak silently watched as the ship disappeared into the distance.

Lim Ji-mun approached his side.

“It seems Master Namgung dislikes you, brother.”

“Seems so.”

“Tsk! For a man who’s the second-in-command of a major sect to be so petty…”

Lim Ji-mun clicked his tongue.

If Namgung Hoe were a reasonable man, he would have set aside past grudges and pride and tried to befriend Lee Gwak.

In the Jianghu, it was always better to make more friends and fewer enemies—one of the secrets to survival.

But Namgung Hoe clearly saw Lee Gwak as a potential enemy.

Lim Ji-mun could guess why.

‘It’s because Brother Gwak isn’t from a prestigious sect like him.’

Being from the orthodox Jade Heaven Alliance himself, Lim Ji-mun understood their mindset better than most.

They never tolerated outsiders intruding on their domain. They feared losing even a fraction of their vested power.

They were quick to seize others’ things but never let go of their own.

And the more unpredictable and threatening someone like Lee Gwak was, the more they rebelled.

Lim Ji-mun felt a heaviness in his chest.

In a time when the orthodox sects should have united to confront the Celestial Demon Troupe, they were obsessed with protecting their meager power, bickering among themselves.

He sighed deeply.

For a while, he stood silently beside Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak, too, said nothing, simply gazing at the water.

By then, the ship had crossed the vast lake and was nearing the opposite shore.

From that point on, the Jeon Gong Escort Agency grew busy.

“Everyone, check your belongings and confirm that everything is in order!”

The lead guard, Soo Gu-san, urged the escorts, who then scurried around with the guards to inspect the cargo.

After everything was double-checked, the report was relayed to Oh Jung-gyeong.

Thud!

In the meantime, the ship docked at the pier.

Oh Jung-gyeong addressed the guards:

“Our destination is just ahead. Once we deliver the cargo to the New Moon Manor, our mission will be complete. Until then, everyone, remain vigilant.”

“Yes, Chief!”

“Don’t worry. We’ll maintain this state until the very end.”

The guards and escorts responded energetically.

Oh Jung-gyeong then turned to Lee Gwak.

“Looks like we’re going to part ways here for a while.”

“You’re heading to the New Moon Manor instead of Wudang?”

“It wouldn’t look good for Wudang to receive the goods directly. That’s why they created a manor in Sibeon to handle these matters. Of course, the manor head is a secular disciple of Wudang…”

“I assume the sect leader trusts him?”

“Yes.”

Oh Jung-gyeong nodded.

The New Moon Manor was located in the bustling district of Sipyeon.

From this point onward, there was no need for Yi Gwak to act as an escort.

“After delivering the goods to Shinyue Manor, I’ll head to the inn where you’re staying.”

“You know where I’ll be staying?”

“Sibeon isn’t that big. With a little effort, I’ll find you quickly. Go ahead and have a drink. Just don’t drink too much.”

“I won’t.”

“Then, I’ll see you in the evening.”

Oh Jung-gyeong led the Jeong Gong Escort Agency away from the pier first.

Lim Ji-mun then spoke to Lee Gwak,

“Elder Brother Oh is right, we should secure an inn first. The opening ceremony won’t start for another two days.”

“Mm.”

“Let’s go. I happen to know a good place to stay.”

“You do?”

When Lee Gwak gave him a surprised look, Lim Ji-mun laughed.

“I’ve traveled quite a bit, you know. I’ve been here once before.”

“Really?”

“Just follow me. You won’t be disappointed.”

With a confident smile, Lim Ji-mun took the lead.

Lee Gwak quietly followed.

As if advertising the Wudang Sect’s opening ceremony, Sibeon was overflowing with martial artists.

Nine out of ten people carried weapons, and most moved in groups.

“Oh, those look like martial artists from the Jingmen Sect. And over there—those folks must be disciples of the Windfire Gate.”

Lim Ji-mun quickly identified them.

He seemed to have the entire Jianghu’s information in his head.

Based on attire, weapons, and subtle characteristics, he pinpointed the sects of the groups passing by.

Suddenly, he exclaimed in surprise.

“Wait, aren’t those the martial artists of the Nine Dragons Clan?”

Lee Gwak looked in the direction Lim Ji-mun pointed.

A group of several dozen martial artists were moving together.

All of them were dressed in black, radiating a sharp, deadly aura.

Nearby martial artists instinctively backed away from their intimidating presence.

Black Dragon Iron Cavalry.

Lee Gwak recognized them immediately.

They were the elite unit serving directly under Gyeong Uncheon, the Blood Sea Divine Sword and leader of the Nine Dragons Clan.

Originally, they consisted of a hundred peak masters. But now, only about thirty remained.

They were protecting someone, their sharp eyes alert and wary of the surroundings.

It was a handsome young man.

His looks were striking enough to draw admiration, but his right arm was missing—severed at the shoulder.

As if sensing Lee Gwak’s gaze, the handsome man turned his head.

For a moment, a terrifying killing intent flashed in his eyes.

“Lee Gwak!”

His roar echoed through the streets.

Those with weaker internal energy collapsed, their eardrums ruptured by the sudden shout.

“Agh!”

“What—?”

The overwhelming roar didn’t just destroy their eardrums—it rattled their brains, leaving them disoriented and moaning in pain.

The street instantly turned into a scene of chaos.

Lee Gwak frowned and looked at the handsome man.

The man, along with the Black Dragon Iron Cavalry, began to advance towards Lee Gwak. A killing intent radiated from them.

“Brother?”

Lim Ji-mun looked at Lee Gwak nervously, but Lee Gwak stood motionless, like a statue.

“Eun Mu-yeong!”

The name escaped Lee Gwak’s lips.

The one-armed handsome man was none other than Eun Mu-yeong, the young master of Nine Dragons Clan.

Last year, Lee Gwak clashed with the Nine Dragons Clan to rescue Nam Woo-gyeong. During that battle, he severed the right arm of Eun Mu-yeong, the sect’s young master, and dealt a heavy blow to the Black Dragon Iron Cavalry.

The defeat at Lee Gwak’s hands, along with the retaliatory strike from the Hao Clan, forced the Nine Dragons Sect to halt all external operations.

Though they had managed to seize the territory of the now-destroyed Zealous Justice Clan, they were ultimately forced to retreat after suffering such a crushing loss.

Because of that, their grudge against Lee Gwak was immense.

Eun Mu-yeong and the Black Dragon Iron Cavalry glared at Lee Gwak with killing intent. If looks could kill, Lee Gwak would have already been torn into thousands of pieces.

Eun Mu-yeong radiated a ferocious aura as if he might strike at any moment. Yet when he actually reached Lee Gwak, he did nothing.

A throbbing pain surged through his severed shoulder.

He had thought it was fully healed, but now, as if mocking him, a fierce pain flared up.

His once-whole arm had been sliced off in an instant by Lee Gwak.

That kind of grudge wasn’t something he could simply forget.

Eun Mu-yeong had secluded himself like a wreck, endlessly stewing in his resentment.

Had the Wudang Sect not sent an envoy to invite the Nine Dragons Clan, he would never have come out.

The Nine Dragons Clan had been founded by Jin Moo-young, the “Peerless Sword”, a former grand disciple of the Wudang Sect.

Over a hundred years ago, the Wudang Sect had suffered near annihilation at the hands of the Demonic Sect. Though they managed to preserve their secrets and treasures, they lacked the strength to protect themselves.

Jin Mu-yeong left the sect to create the Nine Dragons Clan in order to defend Wudang.

While the Wudang sect focused on internal reconstruction, Jin Mu-yeong supported them with the power and resources of the Nine Dragons Clan.

Wudang, in return, offered him ample resources, forming the foundation of what the Nine Dragons Clan is today.

Thus, Wudang and the Nine Dragons Clan shared a mutually beneficial relationship.

Because the occasion was none other than Wudang sect’s opening ceremony, the Nine Dragons Clan had no choice but to suppress their shame and send a delegation.

Eun Mu-yeong was the leader of that delegation.

Though he loathed the idea of appearing in public with one arm more than death itself, he could not defy his master’s command.

Eun Mu-yeong growled like a beast.

“Lee Gwak! How dare you come here, of all places?”

He looked as though he might lunge at Lee Gwak at any moment. But his body wouldn’t move, no matter how much his heart raged.

It was fear.

The terror of watching his arm being severed wasn’t something he could easily overcome.

‘Damn it!’

Eun Mu-yeong bit his lip until it bled.

Drip… drip…

Blood trickled down from the sharp pain, but his body still wouldn’t obey.

Only then did he realize—

The fear of Lee Gwak had been deeply engraved into his soul.

“Lee Gwaaaaak!”

His agonized scream echoed through the streets.
