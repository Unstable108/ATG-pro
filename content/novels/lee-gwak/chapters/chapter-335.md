The Black Wind Squad traveled on horseback, but the vagrants hired from the vagrant market were not afforded such luxury.

Each vagrant was responsible for driving a cart, which was the very purpose for which they had been hired.

Not all vagrants were in the same situation. Some, like those in the Black Wind Squad, had a capable leader and were well-off, while others scraped by day-to-day in the vagrant market.

Although they were all vagrants, an insurmountable wall existed between them. Yet, the hired vagrants did not complain.

Hwangwon Plains was located about 150 li north of Dragon Heaven Valley. A significant amount of grain was harvested annually at Hwangwon Plains, all of which was sent to the Dragon Heaven Valley.

It was precisely because of the grain harvested in Hwangwon Plains that the Dragon Heaven Valley became one of the Ten Sects without having to run any special guilds or businesses. Every year, the grain was sold, bringing in huge profits.

Hwangwon Plains was the most crucial stronghold for Dragon Heaven Valley. The Dragon Valley poured significant resources into protecting Hwangwon Plain, which is why no major incidents had occurred there so far.

While travelling with the Black Wind Squad, Lee Gwak was able to naturally acquire information about the Hwangwon Plains.

The Black Wind Squad didn’t care much for Lee Gwak, as they had only brought him along just to make up the numbers and had no interest in him.

Even knowing this, Lee Gwak wasn’t hurt. The path he had walked was too harsh for him to be upset by something so trivial.

Having overcome numerous adversities, Lee Gwak’s spirit was firmer than anyone else’s.

Lee Gwak looked around with a calm expression, as if he was on a leisurely excursion. His

demeanor caught the attention of Lee Chi-sang.

“Hmm!”

Lee Chi-sang had hired him because he seemed like an ordinary vagrant. For this kind of work, they didn’t need any exceptional vagrants.

Transporting goods might seem dangerous at first glance, but in reality, it was one of the safest jobs. At least within the territory of Dragon Heaven Valley, no one dared to attempt robbery.

There would be some tension when they reached the destination, but so far, nothing out of the ordinary had ever happened. It was a job with minimal risk and consistent profits. For a mercenary, there was no easier work.

Lee Chi-sang didn’t want anyone too clever interfering and taking their share. That’s why, when hiring mercenaries from the market, he deliberately avoided those who seemed too sharp.

Lee Chi-sang rode his horse over to Lee Gwak.

“Is this your first time here?”

“Yes, it is.”

“Do you plan to stay here long?”

“Not really…”

“So, just passing through?”

“Why do you keep asking?”

“Just curious. Don’t change your mind.”

Lee Chi-sang pretended to be nonchalant as he returned to his original position. He felt relieved after confirming that Lee Gwak wasn’t planning to stay long.

Lee Gwak frowned as he watched Lee Chi-sang’s retreating figure. Though Lee Chi-sang tried to hide his thoughts, Lee Gwak could see right through him.

Ja Hong-cheon of the Jade Heaven Alliance had started a war under the guise of a righteous cause, but for some, the war had become a means to make money. They didn’t want the war to end quickly; they hoped it would drag on so they could profit more. Lee Chi-sang was one of those people.

He would never allow anyone to interfere with his share. He had no interest in grand causes or other people’s circumstances.

“Sigh.”

Lee Gwak sighed as he drove the carriage.

He didn’t get a chance to talk to the other vagrants. The Black Wind Squad kept to themselves, and even the vagrants hired by the Black Wind Squad didn’t speak to Lee Gwak. As a result, Lee Gwak didn’t exchange a single word with anyone throughout the journey.

As he continued driving the carriage, the sun eventually set.

Lee Chi-sang pointed to a small clearing by the stream and said, “We’ll sleep here tonight and set out early tomorrow morning.”

This was where the Black Wind Squad always camped when heading to the Hwangwon Plains. Not just the Black Wind Squad, but all mercenary groups transporting goods to Hwangwon Plains used this spot. It was close to water and open on all sides, making it easy to defend against potential attacks.

The Black Wind Squad and the vagrants gathered around the carriages carrying the goods. The Black Wind Squad distributed jerky and dried rations to the vagrants.

“Oh, thank you!”

“As expected of the Black Wind Squad. We’ll eat well.”

The vagrants were grateful just to receive dinner. They took their portions of jerky and rations and returned to their spots.

Lee Gwak also received jerky and rations, but he wasn’t particularly hungry, so he didn’t eat them. He leaned against a small rock and looked up at the sky. The sun had set, and the sky was now a deep, dark blue.

As he gazed at the dark sky, he thought of Han So-cheon and the children.

‘Are they doing well?’

He knew that Han So-cheon would be able to take care of the children and get them safely to Mount Sohua, but he was still worried.

Lost in thought, the night deepened. Except for a few on watch, everyone had already fallen asleep.

“Seems like nothing will happen tonight.”

Lee Chi-sang, who was on watch duty, smiled.

He had traveled this route dozens of times since forming the Black Wind Squad. There had never been an accident, and he believed this time would be no different.

As he surveyed the surroundings, something caught his eye.

There was one person who was not asleep—Lee Gwak.

Lee Chi-sang’s lips twisted.

When he had first hired him, he hadn’t noticed, but the more he watched, the more uneasy he felt about Lee Gwak. It wasn’t that Lee Gwak harbored any hostility towards him or the Black Wind Squad, but there was some intangible distance that made Lee Chi-sang uncomfortable.

Though Lee Gwak looked like a vagrant on the surface, the look in his eyes and his overall bearing were unlike any vagrant he knew.

Just as Lee Chi-sang was about to get up and approach Lee Gwak, Lee Gwak suddenly sprang to his feet.

The movement was so abrupt that Lee Chi-sang tensed up as well.

“What is it?”

“Is anyone else supposed to come here today?”

“No, why?”

The Dragon Heaven Valley strictly managed the transportation schedules to avoid overlaps.

Lee Gwak stared into the pitch-black darkness and replied, “A group is approaching. I think it would be best to wake the others.”

“Are you serious?”

Lee Chi-sang looked at Le Gwak with suspicion. He couldn’t sense anything himself.

If he woke everyone up and nothing happened, he’d have to deal with the irritation of his subordinates. He didn’t believe Lee Gwak’s senses were sharper than his own, so instead of waking the others, he got angry at Lee Gwak.

“Hey! You can’t just say things like that without any basis. Do you really see people approaching? I don’t see anything.”

“They’re twenty zhang away.”

“Twenty zhang? Oh, come on…”

Lee Chi-sang made a disbelieving face.

Even in broad daylight, detecting movement twenty zhang away was impossible. Not even anyone in the Black Wind Squad could do that. Yet, Lee Gwak claimed to sense movement twenty zhang away in pitch darkness. It was hard to believe.

Raising his voice, Lee Chi-sang continued,

“Look, if you keep spouting nonsense, you can’t come with us. We paid you two nyang** of silver, and—”

Shhhck!

Suddenly, Lee Gwak swung his arm towards Lee Chi-sang. Thinking that Lee Gwak was attacking him, Lee Chi-sang was startled and tried to draw his sword.But before he could even halfway unsheathe it, he froze.

Lee Gwak’s hand, holding a small dagger, had stopped right in front of Lee Chi-sang’s face.

“Gasp!”

Lee Chi-sang let out a scream. If Igwak hadn’t caught it, the dagger would have pierced his throat.

“Get up! We’re under attack!”

Lee Chi-sang shouted at the top of his lungs.

“What? An attack?”

“Don’t joke around, boss. What are you talking about…?”

The Black Wind squad sluggishly got up.

Their faces were filled with annoyance, thinking that Lee Chi-sang was joking.

At that moment, Lee Chi-sang drew his sword and shouted.

“It’s a real attack, you bastards!”

“Ah! Really?”

“What?”

Only then did the Black Wind Squad and the vagrants sense the unusual tension and drew their weapons.

That’s when it happened.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

With sharp whistling sounds, more than ten flying daggers came soaring through the air.

“Ugh!”

“Argh!”

Some of the vagrants, who hadn’t managed to draw their weapons in time, were struck in the head or chest by the daggers and collapsed. But the Black Wind Squad had no time to tend to them. They were too busy trying to protect themselves.

Some deflected the daggers with their weapons, while others used their agility to dodge them.

The sudden ambush turned the area into complete chaos.

“Who the hell are these guys?”

“Die, you dogs of Dragon Heaven Valley!”

From the darkness, the attackers revealed themselves.

Their appearance and demeanor were similar to the vagrants affiliated with the Black Wind Squad. They wore shabby clothing and exuded a rough aura.

Without warning, they launched their assault on the Black Wind Squad.

Clang!

Their weapons sliced through the dark.

Lee Gwak frowned slightly as he observed the attackers.

‘Are they Vagrants?’

Vagrants had a unique, uncontrollable wildness about them. And that same aura was emanating from those attacking the Black Wind Squad.

Lee Chi-sang, the leader of the Black Wind Squad, seemed to recognize the attackers and shouted angrily.

“Are you the Mad Wolf Squad?”

The Mad Wolf Squad was a group of vagrants, much like the Black Wind Squad. However, they were larger in number and consisted of stronger martial artists.

Like wolves, they would not tolerate other martial artists entering their territory.

Because of this, most vagrant groups avoided clashing with the Mad Wolf Squad. Until now, the Black Wind Squad had operated in different areas, so they had never crossed paths.

Lee Chi-sang glared at So Jin-rak, the leader of the Mad Wolf Squad.

So Jin-rak was about five feet tall with a chubby physique, more resembling a merchant than a martial artist. Those who saw him for the first time often underestimated him based on his

appearance alone. However, none who underestimated So Jin-rak had lived to tell the tale.

Lee Chi-sang had met So Jin-rak long ago.

But they had kept their distance, avoiding conflict.

Lee Chi-sang shouted angrily.

“Our Black Wind Squad has no grudge against the Mad Wolf Squad. Why are you attacking us?”

“Hehe! There’s only one reason a group like ours would move.”

“What is it?”

“Our client finds you a thorn in their side. What can we do?”

“You were hired? Who hired you?”

“You’re really stupid. I’ve said this much, and you still don’t get it?”

“What?”

“There’s no rule that only the Dragon Heaven Valley can hire vagrants. Still don’t understand?”

“Jade… Jade Heaven Alliance has hired you.”

“Correct. Hehe!”

Finally realizing the truth, Lee Chi-sang’s face hardened like stone.

“Damn it! Jade Heaven Alliance hiring the Mad Wolf Squad.”

“Don’t hold it against us too personally.”

So Jin-rak smirked.

Even then, the Mad Wolf Squad was fiercely pressing on the Black Wind Squad.

The Mad Wolf Squad was not only more skilled, but they also outnumbered them.

“Argh!”

“Agh!”

One by one, the Black Wind Squad’s vagrants fell.

Lee Chi-sang gritted his teeth.

He had thought that nothing would happen, as nothing had before.

Only then did he realize how complacent he had been.

“You bastard!”

Lee Chi-sang charged at So Jin-rak.

Clang!

But he hadn’t got more than a few steps before he was blocked by two vagrants. They were subordinates of So Jin-rak, attacking him to protect their leader.

“Eek! Get out of the way!”

“Where do you think you’re going?”

Lee Chi-sang gritted his teeth and attacked, but he couldn’t easily overcome So Jin-rak’s subordinates.

The Mad Wolf Squad was as infamous for their martial arts skills as they were feared, ranking among the top vagrants. There were quite a few martial artists in the Mad Wolf Squad as skilled as Lee Chi-sang.

“Kuhuk! Boss!”

At that moment, one of the Black Wind Squad’s vagrants fell, spilling blood.

Lee Chi-sang’s eyes turned bloodshot.

He could only watch helplessly as his subordinate died, unable to do anything.

“Hehe!”

So Jin-rak sneered as he watched Lee Chi-sang’s despairing expression.

Though Lee Chi-sang was unaware, the supply shipments currently being transported from Dragon Heaven Valley were being ambushed by ruffians hired by the Changcheon Alliance.

The Jade Heaven Alliance, which had previously relied solely on their main forces to confront Dragon Heaven Valley and the Seven Sects, had now changed their strategy by hiring vagrant groups like the Mad Wolf Squad.

The tide of the war was shifting.

“Damn it!”

Lee Chi-sang’s voice, filled with despair, echoed across the battlefield.

No matter how much he attacked, he couldn’t get closer to So Jin-rak, and this fact only deepened his despair.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Gradually, the sound of clashing weapons began to diminish.

This was a sign that the numbers of the Black Wind Corps were dwindling.

Then, it happened.

Ssshhhk!

An eerie sound of slicing air reverberated across the battlefield.

At that moment, So Jin-rak felt a chilling coldness and shuddered involuntarily.

His gaze turned toward the direction of the sound.

“What?”

So Jin-rak’s eyes widened.

In his line of sight, he saw one of his subordinates collapsing, blood spurting out.

Behind the falling subordinate stood a man holding a straight blade, still sheathed.

He hadn’t even drawn his blade.

Simply swinging the sheathed sword was enough to bring down a ruffian from the Mad Wolf Squad.

The man’s gaze turned toward So Jin-rak.

“You?”

Shiver!

A tremor ran through So Jin-rak at the man’s cold gaze.
