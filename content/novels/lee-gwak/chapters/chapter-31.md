Episode 2. Not a Single Person to Welcome Me Home (3)

The brothel that Squad 7s leader guided them to was a rather large establishment outside the Outer Hall. Red lanterns hung in abundance at the eaves, and between the wide-open windows flowed the delicate laughter of courtesans accompanied by the sound of music.

Lee Gwak, who had lived in the Jade Heaven Alliance for quite some time, had never seen such an extravagant brothel. It was a place he couldnt even dream of entering with his salary.

Maeng Hee-cheon and Squad 7s leader entered the brothel without hesitation.

Welcome, Hall Leader Maeng!

The manager rushed out to greet Maeng Hee-cheon.

Do you know me?

Who in Jianghu does not know Leader Maeng of the Jade Heaven Alliance? We are sincerely grateful that a hero like you has visited our humble establishment.

Heh! A hero, you say? You flatter me too much, Manager.

How could I tell a lie? As a proof of my sincerity, we have prepared the best girls of our brothel for you. Please, come inside.

A smile formed on the corners of Maeng Hee-cheons mouth.

He was aware that half of the Managers words were flattery, but no one disliked being praised, especially not himself.

Maeng Hee-cheon strutted forward with pride, followed by the squad leaders who surrounded him like a screen. The manager, with a full-faced smile, led them to their room.

Here we are.

When the door was opened, they were greeted by a lavishly set banquet room. Red lanterns and silk adorned the room where a long table stood laden with delicacies from all over the land. Scented candles were placed here and there, adding to the ambiance.

Maeng Hee-cheon sat at the head of the table, and the squad leaders took their places according to age and rank. Naturally, Lee Gwaks seat was at the very end.

Lee Gwak found such an occasion quite burdensome, but he didnt let it show. The other squad leaders, on the other hand, laughed and chatted with each other, seemingly quite accustomed to this sort of gathering.

Maeng Hee-cheon sat at the seat of honor, looking over the squad leaders and smirking to himself. The manager then clapped his hands. Then an entire wall opened up, revealing the courtesans who had been waiting.

The moment the courtesans appeared, the eyes of Maeng Hee-cheon and the squad leaders shook. The courtesans were much more beautiful than they had anticipated.

An exclamation of admiration escaped Maeng Hee-cheons lips.

The manager then beckoned to the most beautiful maiden.

You, sit beside Leader Maeng. He is a hero of the land, and you must serve him well.

Of course.

The courtesan walked over lightly like a butterfly and sat next to Maeng Hee-cheon. Her body emanated a sweet fragrance like honey that made Maeng Hee-cheons mind dizzy.

My name is Wola. It is an honor to serve you.

Oh, very good! Hahaha!

The manager motioned for the rest of the courtesans to take their places.

You girls, take your seats as well.

The elaborately dressed courtesans took their places beside each squad leader.

My name is Choha.

The courtesan who sat next to Lee Gwak greeted him with a bright smile. Her thick makeup made it difficult to guess her age, but her youthful voice suggested she was much younger than Lee Gwak.

Chohas beauty was like a rose, perhaps accentuated by her makeup.

The scent of a mature woman, which Lee Gwak smelled for the first time in a long while, made his head spin for a moment.

Not only Lee Gwak, but everyone present was momentarily entranced by the allure of the courtesans. Their coquettish charm and smiles could melt the toughest of men in an instant.

Please accept this drink.

Sure, pour it all out.

The atmosphere in the room quickly became heated.

Maeng Hee-cheon gulped down the drink that Wola had poured for him. The other squad leaders did the same.

Maeng Hee-cheon wrapped his arm around Wolas shoulder and spoke to the squad leaders.

Were going all out tonight. Anyone who leaves early wont be able to step foot in our Outer Hall again, got it?

You are indeed the best, Hall Leader. Hahaha!

We will follow you no matter what, Hall Leader.

The squad leaders praised Maeng Hee-cheon and raised their cups high. Their actions under Maeng Hee-cheons lead were almost blindly obedient, like military officials.

Maeng Hee-cheon kept bursting into laughter, clearly in a good mood, while Wola continued to liven up the atmosphere.

Drinks were passed around nonstop, and the mood in the room heated up intensely. Some were already burying their faces in the courtesans bosoms. 𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝑐𝘰𝑚

Lee Gwak watched the scene, drinking moderately. Choha by his side poured drinks and offered him food. Lee Gwak did not refuse Chohas service. However, his eyes were calmer than ever before.

The initial excitement and nervousness when Choha first sat beside him was long gone. Lee Gwak found his own change quite surprising.

Upon further reflection, Lee Gwak realized it was because of the Eight Snakes Art. The foundation of the Eight Snakes Art was the Yoga Secret Manual, a practice transmitted from Tianzhu. Among the Yoga Techniques was also the practice of enhancing ones achievements through a union with a woman.

That was why Lee Gwak was not swept away by Choha. Those who had mastered the Yoga Secret Manual advanced themselves through the balance of yin and yang, never being swept to one side or the other.

His body reacted to Chohas fragrance, yet his mind remained cool. Lee Gwak found his reaction curious but showed no sign of it. But a womans senses were frightening.

Choha whispered in a soft voice,

Youre quite strange, warrior.

Its my first time seeing someone as composed as you in this place.

Thats just my nature.

Is that so?

Choha smiled faintly at Lee Gwaks response. Her appearance was stunning enough to daze the mind, but Lee Gwak kept his expression stoic.

Choha leaned closer to Lee Gwak, pouring another drink. He didnt know if it was intentional, but he could feel her chest against his forearm.

When Lee Gwak looked at her, Choha looked up, and their eyes met. Her gaze was full of allure.

Choha felt a strange flutter in her chest.

Although she was young, she had been through many experiences as a courtesan. She was used to enchanting men, not being enchanted by them. There was no reason for her heart to flutter like this.

So it was strange. Her reaction now. The inexplicable fluttering in her chest.

Why am I feeling this way?

Chohas face flushed with heat.

She fanned herself as if it were too hot.

Indeed, the atmosphere in the room was hot. Maeng Hee-cheon had already gone to another room with Wola, and the squad leaders were engaging in their own indulgences with the courtesans by their sides. The courtesans bewitched the squad leaders with their coquettish and seductive laughter.

By now, there were no sane people left in the room. There were only lustful males and courtesans attending to the desires of such beasts.

Lee Gwak found the atmosphere hard to comprehend. No matter how starved Maeng Hee-cheon and the others were for women, he couldnt believe they could succumb to their desires so quickly.

Lee Gwaks hand, holding a cup, paused.

The scent of the alcohol was unusually sweet to the point of suspicion. No matter how fine the liquor was, it shouldnt emit such an aroma.

Could it be?

Lee Gwaks gaze drifted to the scented candles lighting up the room. Initially, he thought they were just for ambiance, but on closer inspection, he realized the scent from the candles was mixing with the liquors fragrance, stimulating the mind and senses.

It was a moment of clarity for Lee Gwak. So he discreetly used the Eight Snakes Art to heighten his senses. Thats when he felt a stealthy gaze.

It wasnt from the courtesans.

Lee Gwak looked toward the wall to his side without letting Choha notice. He felt the gaze from there. Someone was secretly watching this room from the next.

Is this not an ordinary brothel?

It was the Jade Heaven Alliance they were dealing with, after all.

When the Jade Heaven Alliance moved, it could shake the very foundations of the Jianghu, so many factions had sent people to monitor its movements.

Lee Gwak had heard of places that actually operated for that purpose, but this was his first time experiencing one. The brothel was perfectly designed to bewitch men.

Every decoration in the room, from the lanterns to the scented candles, was set to create the optimal conditions to seduce a man. And with women trained in the art of seduction, no man in his right mind would be able to resist their seduction.

Lee Gwak considered informing Maeng Hee-cheon and the squad leaders of this fact but decided against it.

To warn them that they were under surveillance, he would have to explain how he had noticed, which would entail revealing his level of martial arts. Lee Gwak didnt feel the need to do so.

Choha grabbed Lee Gwaks arm tightly to prevent him from drinking more. Lee Gwak read a hint of urgency in her eyes.

It was a sign of her impatience because her seduction had no effect on him.

Lee Gwak inwardly sighed.

He felt like he had been swept into a troublesome affair.

If he were to shake off Chohas arm and leave, he would certainly attract attention, which was the last thing Lee Gwak wanted.

When Lee Gwak stood up, Choha responded with an excited voice. She pressed her body close to his arm.

She led Lee Gwak to her room.

The door closed behind them.

The last guy has now entered his room.

Is that so?

He held out quite long. He seems to have a strong mind.

Well, theres always a few like that.

The man replied with a nonchalant expression as he closed the book he was reading and looked at the person who was reporting.

The person reporting was none other than the manager of the brothel. He treated the other man with extreme courtesy.

The man looked out of place in the lavish brothel.

His hair was disheveled, and his clothes were shabby. Under normal circumstances, he would not have been allowed entry into the brothel. Yet, the glimpse of his eyes through the unkempt hair revealed a striking depth and clarity.

It was a gaze that did not match his shabby appearance. The manager kept his head down, not daring to look the man in the eye.

The manager cautiously opened his mouth.

Do we really need to treat these lowly Outer Hall nobodies with such hospitality?

Surely youre not serious?

The managers expression froze instantly.

What, after being a manager and meeting high-ranking people, does everyone else seem insignificant to you?

No, not at all.

Remember this! There is no hierarchy in terms of information. Some information can come from high places, and some information can only come from below. This place was created to get information from below. Do you understand?

I will bear that in mind.

The manager answered in a steadfast manner, although there was a slight tremor around his eyes.

The shabby man before him was by no means ordinary. Unknown to the world, he possessed a brilliant mind surpassing any in Jianghu, as well as a powerful martial art and immense authority.

A single word from him, and the manager could be ousted onto the streets, his life returning to wretchedness.

The man withdrew his gaze from the manager.

The Great Heavenly Blood War might break out soon. The entire Jianghu will be drenched in blood, and numerous lives will be lost. Yet, the Jade Heaven Alliance is cutting off information. We must gather as much information as possible to survive. So extract whatever information you can without discrimination.

Especially curry favor with the Outer Hall Leader Maeng Hee-cheon. If we establish a connection with him, we might be able to connect with the Heavenly Intelligence Hall, which is in charge of external information.

I understand.

Take good care of the squad leaders who came today as well. We might need them later.

Ill keep that in mind.

The man stood up after hearing the managers response.

Ill be leaving now, but report immediately if anything unusual happens. Oh, and make sure to send me the personal details of the squad leaders who were entertained today, and keep track of them regularly.

The man knocked on the wall. With a dull sound, the wall slid open, revealing a secret passage.

The secret passage led to the back alley of the brothel, a place hidden from the public eye. The man exited through the secret passage.

His destination, as he walked leisurely, was the northern slums. His figure disappeared into the darkness.
