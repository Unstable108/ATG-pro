The gossipers named this great clash of the Jianghu the “Demon Heaven Great War.”

The Heavenly Justice Alliance emerged victorious in the Demon Heaven Great War.

The Celestial Demon Troupe was defeated, and its followers vanished from sight.

No one knew exactly how many members of the Celestial Demon Troupe remained. However, since so many martial artists had died, people vaguely guessed that there probably weren’t many left.

The Celestial Demon Troupe left a great scar on the Jianghu.

Many martial artists from the Celestial Demon Troupe died, but the Heavenly Justice Alliance and the martial artists who joined it also suffered heavy casualties.

Thousands died, and several times that number were seriously wounded. The number of martial artists who went missing during the Demon Heaven Great War was beyond count.

Sects that lost many disciples declined, while those who achieved great merits and suffered minimal losses saw their prestige rise instead.

Sects like the Thousand Kingdom School, the Sky High Castle Alliance, the Dragon Heaven Valley, the Mount Hua Sect, and the Wudang Sect performed impressively and were praised as renowned names of the Jianghu. However, the Mad Martial Sect, led by Lee Gwak, received the greatest recognition.

Although the Mad Martial Sect was located in the remote northeast of the Jianghu, a steady stream of visitors never ceased.

Above all, Lee Gwak was highly praised for disbanding the Heavenly Justice Alliance after the war.

Once one seizes power, it is difficult to relinquish it—especially when the power in question was a giant force uniting the entire Jianghu.

In fact, some individuals had approached Lee Gwak, subtly suggesting that he maintain the Alliance.

They argued it should be kept at least until the chaos in the Jianghu was settled. However, Lee Gwak disbanded the Alliance without a moment’s hesitation.

Many were shocked by Lee Gwak’s decision.

The benefits Lee Gwak could have gained by maintaining the Alliance were immense. But he brushed off all such temptations and returned to the Mad Martial Sect.

Even after returning to the Mad Martial Sect, he avoided public events and lived in seclusion.

Yet even so, the prestige of Mad Martial Sect did not wane.

It became the undisputed hegemon of the northeast.

Day after day, many people came, hoping to catch even a single glimpse of Lee Gwaks face. But Lee Gwak remained secluded in his residence, never showing himself to the outside world.

The Thousand Kingdom School regained its former prestige. The martial artists of Dragon Spring Valley, led by Mok Seon-wol, returned to their original base.

The Martial Sword Troupe was hailed as the dominant force in Southern Jianghu.

The Mount Hua and Wudang Sects used their participation in the Demon Heaven Great War as an opportunity to resume their activities in the Jianghu.

However, the Wood Willow Manor at Hongze Lake benefited the most.

The sight of Jang Cheon-hwa delivering the final blow to Go Geom-wol left an indelible impression on the Jianghu.

Thanks to this, the Heavenly Martial Manor established itself as a rising power in the Jianghu. Already possessing immense financial resources, the added prestige naturally drew people in.

The Demon Heaven Great War inflicted great damage on the Jianghu but also injected vitality into it.

With so many of the older generation of martial artists dead, a new generation of martial artists rose to take their places, leading to a natural generational shift.

New faces rapidly rose to prominence in each sect.

The older martial artists were pushed into retirement or naturally relegated to the background by the powerful winds of generational change.

Thus, a new order was born in the Jianghu, and it took root.

Hongze Lake has long been renowned for its splendid scenery.

Among the countless lakes under heaven, it ranked within the top five in terms of sheer size. Moreover, its well-developed waterways had long made it a central hub for the movement of goods.

Its splendid scenery and abundance of historical relics had long drawn poets and scholars. But in recent years, it became even more famous because of the sect established on its shores.

After distinguishing itself in the Demon Heaven Great War, the Heavenly Martial Manor grew steadily.

Previously, it was perceived more as the estate of a wealthy merchant than as a martial sect. Now, however, it is recognized as the undisputed hegemon of the region.

Those who visited Hongze Lake invariably stopped by the Heavenly Martial Manor. It was famous for its beautifully and lavishly decorated interior.

The Heavenly Martial Manor opened part of its outer compound to the public. The scenery of the outer compound alone was worthy of being called the finest under heaven.

If the outer compound was like this, one could hardly imagine the beauty of the inner compound. People were curious about the inner compound’s scenery, but the Heavenly Martial Manor absolutely did not allow outsiders unrelated to the manor to enter.

Some people tried to sneak in, but the sect’s martial artists thwarted their attempts.

Today, many people also visited the outer compound of the Heavenly Martial Manor to admire the beautiful scenery.

“Ha! They say the Heavenly Martial Manor’s scenery is the finest under heaven, and it truly is beautiful.”

“If anything, the rumors don’t even capture half of the reality.”

People couldn’t contain their admiration; their faces radiated awe.

At that moment, two men entered the Heavenly Martial Manor.

One appeared to be in his late thirties or early forties, while the other was a young man in his early twenties who resembled him.

They looked like father and son, wealthy and imposing. Without so much as a glance at the scenery of the Heavenly Martial Manor, they headed straight for the entrance to the sect’s inner courtyard.

The guards sensed something unusual and blocked their path.

“Stop. No one may enter without permission.”

“We have come to meet your Manor Lord. Please inform him.”

“First, reveal your identity.”

The eyes of the Heavenly Martial Sect martial artists flashed fiercely.

It was the kind of gaze that would make ordinary people’s knees tremble. But the middle-aged man simply smiled nonchalantly and gave a fist salute.

“My apologies for the late introduction. I am Lee Gwak of the Mad Martial Sect.”

The Heavenly Martial Sect martial artists’ eyes widened in shock.

After the Demon Heaven Great War, Lee Gwak had rarely shown himself in public. For him to suddenly appear here was unavoidably surprising.

“I wish to see the Master of your manor.”

They couldn’t hide their bewilderment at Lee Gwak’s unexpected words. But they quickly collected themselves and sent word inside.

If this man truly was Lee Gwak, he was beyond their control.

He was the undisputed martial artist hailed as the best in the current Jianghu.

Regardless of why he had come unannounced, they had to inform the inside first.

The eyes of the Heavenly Martial Sect martial artists wavered uneasily.

Inside, people quickly recognized Lee Gwak, and whispers spread.

As some gathered the courage to approach him, a man in his mid-forties hurried out.

“Welcome, Great Hero Lee! I am Geum Jug-wang, overseer of the outer grounds of the Manor. We are honored by your visit.”

“I apologize for arriving unannounced.”

“Not at all. The Manor Lord awaits you. Please, come inside.”

With utmost courtesy, Geum Jug-wang led Lee Gwak and the young man into the inner gardens.

The inner grounds were even more magnificient than the outer ones.

Fine houses, shimmering ponds, elegant statues, and ornate pavilions filled the place, like a vast work of art.

Right in the middle of it all, however, stood a tombstone that seemed out of place.

A black tombstone with no name engraved shone under the sunlight.

A man stood before the tombstone.

A man around the same age as the young man accompanying Lee Gwak. He was none other than Jang Cheon-hwa, the Master of Heavenly Martial Manor.

Jang Cheon-hwa, his face stiff, looked at Lee Gwak and made a fist-salute.

“Jang Cheon-hwa, Master of Heavenly Martial Manor, pays his respects to Hero Lee.”

“It’s been a long time, Young Hero Zhang. You’ve become much more dignified. You truly carry the aura of a leader now,” Lee Gwak replied respectfully.

Although young, he acknowledged Jang Cheon-hwa as the head of a sect.

Despite Lee Gwak’s respectful attitude, Jang Cheon-hwa’s stiff expression did not soften. No, he couldn’t soften it.

Lee Gwak was that formidable presence.

Just then, the young man next to Lee Gwak familiarly addressed Jang Cheon-hwa.

Jang Cheon-hwa looked at the young man with a puzzled expression.

He had met countless people so far, but only one person had ever called him ‘brother’.

“It’s me, Lee Cheong! Brother!”

“You’re not saying you’ve forgotten me, are you?”

The man cheerfully calling Jang Cheon-hwa “brother” was none other than Yi Gwak’s son, Yi Cheong.

“How could I forget you? It’s been a long time.”

“Do you know how disappointed I was when you just disappeared from the battlefield like that?”

“I had my reasons. I’m sorry.”

Jang Cheon-hwa apologized with a stiff expression.

Their connection had been nothing more than a fleeting encounter. Yet Jang Cheon-hwa couldn’t disregard Yi Qing because he was Yi Gwak’s son.

Countless subtle emotions, impossible to put into words, crossed Jang Cheon-hwa’s eyes as he looked at Yi Gwak.

“What brings the great hero here?”

“I felt I should stop by once before leaving the martial world, so I took the liberty of dropping in unannounced.”

“But no, you’re still in your prime. Why?”

“Because I have nothing left to do in the martial world now.”

“My time in the martial world ended then.”

Jang Cheon-hwa asked without realizing it.

“My duel with the Celestial Demon Troupe Leader, Go Geom-wol, was my final battle. There was no reason for me to stay any longer.”

“Then why didn’t you retire immediately afterward?”

“Because I needed to prepare.”

“To keep Young Hero Zhang in check.”

At Lee Gwak’s calm words, Jang Cheon-hwa’s face froze.

And it wasn’t just Jang Cheon-hwa who was tense.

From the servant sweeping the floor in the distance, to the maid bringing tea cups, to the martial artists guarding the inner compound—all stared at Lee Gwak with tense eyes.

The inner compound was still splendid, but the atmosphere among the people within was agitated, as if it could explode at any moment.

Amidst it all, only Lee Gwak and his son remained composed.

Jang Cheon-hwa stared at Lee Gwak with deeply sunken eyes.

It was an intense gaze, reminiscent of when he first met Go Geom-wol.

Looking at Jang Cheon-hwa’s eyes, Lee Gwak recalled old memories for the first time in a long while.

Jang Cheon-hwa asked, “Since when have you known?”

“Then why have you been watching until now?”

The Heavenly Martial Manor went silent.

It was like the night before a storm; not a sound could be heard.

Even the noisy insects were crushed into silence by the killing intent filling the courtyard. It was as if the entire inner compound was imbued with killing intent, pressuring Lee Gwak and his son. Yet Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong wore expressions of utter calm, seemingly unaware or indifferent to this fact.

Lee Gwak walked towards the tombstone in the inner compound.

He gently stroked the nameless tombstone.

Although no one had told him who was buried there, Lee Gwak knew who it was.

It was as if he was longing for an old friend. Seeing Lee Gwak’s demeanor, Jang Cheon-hwa’s stiff expression softened slightly.

Below the tombstone lay the person he respected most in the world.

Before the Demon Heaven Great War began, Go Geom-wol had sought him out. And forced him to make a promise.

—If I am defeated, you must be the one to end my last breath.

—I cannot do that, Master. How could a disciple…?

—By killing me, you will become a hero of the Jianghu, and Heavenly Martial Manor will be recognized as a legitimate sect of the Jianghu. Promise me. If I am defeated, you must be the one to kill me.

Jang Cheon-hwa promised, shedding tears of blood, and ultimately fulfilled that promise.

In return, the Heavenly Martial Manor was able to establish itself in the Jianghu without anyone’s suspicion.

Although Go Geom-wol died, according to his wishes, the Celestial Demon Troupe survived.

That was the secret of the Heavenly Martial Sect.

Lee Gwak, still with his hand on the tombstone, spoke.

“My time in the Jianghu ended with that fight against him. From the beginning, I was always running forward, chasing his back.”

It hadn’t taken long for Lee Gwak to learn the truth that Jang Cheon-hwa was Go Geom-wol’s disciple.

That was because Ki Jin-hwi had noticed that a facial alteration art had been applied to Ki Jin-hwi ‘s face.

Ki Jin-hwi had detected traces of Gyeong Chu-wol’s technique on Jang Cheon-hwa’s face. He investigated secretly and eventually uncovered the truth.

The Heavenly Martial Manor was the legacy Go Geom-wol had secretly left behind.

After their defeat in the Demon Heaven Great War, a significant number of Celestial Demon Troupe martial artists fled and were absorbed into Heavenly Martial Manor. There, they lived ordinary lives as members of the manor.

They had become members of the Jianghu, just as Go Geom-wol had so desperately wanted.

The Jianghu was unaware of this fact. They only believed they had won, never realizing the Troupe had seeped into their midst.

Only Lee Gwak and a few others knew the truth.

Lee Gwak had struggled with this for years. Perhaps it would have been better to crush the Pavilion with the armies of the Jianghu and prevent future troubles.

Yet he never acted because of Go Geom-wol.

He was the only man Lee Gwak both respected and regarded as a rival.

The Pavilion was a small tree that Go Geom-wol had watered with his own life so it might barely take root. To chop it down simply to remove a hidden threat felt wrong to Leee Gwak.

So he raised another tree instead, Lee Cheong.

For years, Lee Gwak passed down everything to his son. Every insight he had gained, every technique he had mastered. He even handed down the position of Lord of the Mad Martial Sect.

Lee Gwak had almost nothing left, yet he felt no regret.

“From here on, it will be Cheong’s task to keep Young Master Jang in check.”

New wine must be put in new wine bottles, and in a new Jianghu, young martial artists must take the stage.

That was the conclusion Lee Gwak had reached.

Jang Cheon-hwa stared intently at Lee Gwak’s face.

He soon realized that Lee Gwak was speaking the truth.

Lee Gwak was that kind of man.

The only martial artist his master, Go Geom-wol, respected.

A man without blazing ambition, but one who always kept his word.

He had fought Go Geom-wol not out of ambition to rise higher, but simply because fate had placed him opposite his rival.

That was why Jang Cheon-hwa had never once resented Lee Gwak for driving his master to death.

Suddenly, Jang Cheon-hwa smiled.

“Cheong… Do you really think he can? You’ll regret this.”

“You’d better be careful yourself. I’m not as bright and noble as my father.”

Jang Cheon-hwa’s eyes flashed with menace as he glared at Lee Cheong. But even that gaze could not erase the smile from Lee Cheong’s face.

His spirit was not weaker than Jang Cheon-hwa’s.

An invisible spark seemed to fly between the two as they looked at each other.

Just then, someone cautiously approached Lee Gwak.

It was Jin Han-cheon, the Chief Steward of the Manor.

He wiped his face and revealed his true appearance. Lee Gwak seemed to recognize him.

“So it really was you, Master Jin.”

He was none other than Jin Woo-seon, once a follower of Go Geom-wol.

He had been serving as the manor’s chief steward and acting as Jang Cheon-hwa’s guardian.

Jin Woo-seon glared at Lee Gwak and spoke,

“I thank you for your goodwill. But that does not mean my resentment towards you will disappear. Once the Heavenly Martial Manor stabilizes, I will surely come to you and avenge Geom-wol’s death.”

“I will await your visit, Master Jin,” Lee Gwak replied sincerely.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong stepped out of the main gate of Heavenly Martial Manor.

They left as quietly as they had come.

Outside, a middle-aged beauty and a lovely young woman were waiting:

Han So-cheon smiled and held out her hand. Lee Gwak clasped her fair hand in his.

“Are you really going to live in seclusion, just the two of you?

Cheong will stay with the Mad Martial Sect, of course, but what about me? Can’t I come too?”

“You already promised to visit Master Muk.”

“Ugh! Why did he have to call for me now of all times…”

Lee Gwak and Han So-cheon looked at each other and smiled.

Seclusion didn’t suit Lee Su-ah’a.

Her life in the Jianghu was just beginning.

Lee Gwak and Han So-cheon walked away hand in hand, while Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah’a stood in place, watching their retreating figures.

The great journey of the ordinary martial artist ended here.

The responsibility to carry on his legacy now lay with those who remained.
