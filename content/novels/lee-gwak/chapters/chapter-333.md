Han So Cheon had left with the children.

Although the children were reluctant to part from Lee Gwak, they did not refuse to go with Han So Cheon. They both realised their inadequacies after experiencing Jianghu.

Lee Cheong accepted the farewell to Lee Gwak calmly, while Lee Soo-ah told Lee Gwak to wait as she would be back soon.

Lee Gwak patted the children’s backs and then informed Han So Cheon how to reopen the closed Steel Hell Blood Training Hall.

In the whole world, no one knew the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall as well as Lee Gwak did. Naturally, he knew how to enter the closed facility and how to get it operational again.

Lee Gwak shared everything he knew with Han So Cheon.

After Han So Cheon and the children had departed, a wave of loneliness swept over Lee Gwak.

He wanted to accompany them, but Han So Cheon had opposed it.

“Oraboni doesn’t need the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall. There’s no need to come with us just because of us. Oraboni, you have bigger things to accomplish in Jianghu.”

At Han So Cheon’s words, Lee Gwak had no choice but to remain alone.

He spent the whole day in the empty outbuilding by himself. He had never realized before how lonely it was to be alone.

He started moving again a day after Han So Cheon and the children had left.

He packed his belongings and left the outbuilding.

His horse had been taken by Han So Cheon and Lee Soo-ah, allowing Lee Gwak to leave the outbuilding unburdened.

Lee Gwak’s destination was the Gaiyang branch of the Hao Clan.

Upon his arrival, the branch head, Gam Il-so, greeted him warmly.

“Welcome, Master Lee! Are you departing now?”

“Yes! I have received much assistance during my stay. Thank you.”

“It has been an honor to assist Master Lee.”

Gam Il-so was sincere.

Thanks to helping Lee Gwak, he had received high praise from Nam Woo-gyeong, the young master of Hao Clan. It was only a matter of time before he would be transferred to a more prominent branch.

That’s why he looked at Lee Gwak with such genuine warmth. After a moment of quiet observation, Gam Il-so suddenly spoke as if he had remembered something.

“Ah, yes! I received some news this morning.”

“What news?”

“Part of the Jade Heaven Alliance’s outer hall is heading towards the Dragon Heaven Valley.”

“Outer hall? Could it be…”

“The Seventeenth and Nineteenth squads are involved. I believe both squad leaders are acquainted with Master Lee.”

The leader of the 17th squad was Seok Yi Cheon, and the leader of the 19th squad was Go Cheon-Gwang, with the deputy leader being Woo Il-young. All of them had been in Lee Gwak’s 13th squad.

They were like brothers to Lee Gwak.

“What would they be doing near the Dragon Heaven Valley?”

In the vicinity of Dragon Heaven Valley, the war with the Jade Heaven Alliance was in full swing. The Dragon Heaven Valley was fighting equally against the Jade Heaven Alliance, in alliance with the Myriad Merchant Troupe.

The area was a hellish battlefield where numerous people died daily. Therefore, only the best warriors from the Jade Heaven Alliance, Dragon Heaven Valley, and the Myriad Merchant Troupe were sent.

Under normal circumstances, it was unusual for the martial artists of the outer hall to stay in such a place. Naturally, it was puzzling to Lee Gwak.

Gam Il-so shook his head.

“We don’t yet know the reason. I just thought you would be interested, so I wanted to let you know.”

“Hmm.”

Lee Gwak murmured.

He had been curious about how Seok Yi Cheon was doing.

“You said near the Dragon Heaven Valley? Then it’s not too far from here, right?.”

“Yes, it’s about three days on horseback or six days on foot. Are you heading to the Dragon Heaven Valley?”

“Yes!”

Lee Gwak answered without a moment’s hesitation.

If he had not known where Seok Yi Cheon was, it would have been different, but knowing and not going would be unthinkable. Moreover, the location wasn’t far from Gaiyang where he was now.

He could arrive within five days if he hurried. There was no reason not to go.

“If Brother Nam asks about me, tell him I’ve gone to the Dragon Heaven Valley.”

“Even if I don’t mention it, young master Nam will know of Master Lee’s whereabouts. Don’t worry and have a safe journey.”

“Thank you.”

Lee Gwak nodded his head.

Thinking of Seok Yi Cheon brought a smile to his face.

Seok Yi Cheon was a very special person to him. The thought of meeting him again filled him with a warm feeling.

The emptiness Lee Gwak felt after Han So Cheon and the children left was filled again.

After bidding Gam Il-so goodbye, he set off.

He walked along the road.

He wanted to ride, but unfortunately, there were no horse markets around, and the horse he rode had been taken by Han So Cheon. He had no choice but to walk.

However, with a clear destination in mind, his steps were light.

Lee Gwak followed the road diligently. The sun was hot, but it didn’t stop him from walking.

When tired, he would rest; when night fell, he would sleep outdoors.

When he was with Lee Cheong, he had to consider him, but now, being alone, he didn’t need to worry.

Although Gam Il-so had said it would take six days, Lee Gwak reached Taijiang, not far from Dragon Heaven Valley, in just five days.

Taijiang served as a kind of gateway to Dragon Heaven Valley.

Anyone wishing to enter Dragon Heaven Valley had to first stay in Taijiang and receive permission from the valley.

Since Lee Gwak didn’t necessarily need to enter Dragon Heaven Valley, he stayed in Taijiang to gather information about the outer squad of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

True to its reputation as the gateway to Dragon Heaven Valley, Taijiang was filled with martial artists.

Seeing an armed martial artist here was as common as finding a pebble on a riverbank, so no one paid particular attention to Lee Gwak.

Silently, Lee Gwak entered Taijiang.

The first thing he did upon arriving in Taijiang was to find an inn.

Over the past five days, he hadn’t slept in a proper bed. He was worn out from sleeping outdoors, but more importantly, an inn—crowded with travelers—was the perfect place to pick up the information he needed.

Too many people had entered Taijiang, and almost every inn was fully booked.

Eventually, Lee Gwak managed to secure a decent room only after paying a considerable extra fee.

After securing a room, the first thing Lee Gwak did was take a bath.

After washing off the dust accumulated over five days he headed down to the restaurant on the first floor.

By the time he arrived at the restaurant, all the seats were taken.

For a moment, he looked around the dining hall with a slightly perplexed expression. But his eyes soon rested on a spot by the window, and he headed that way.

Unlike the other tables, which were fully occupied, only two people were sitting at the table: an old man and a young girl.

The old man’s face was full of wrinkles, and his hair, eyebrows, and beard were white, giving him an almost celestial appearance.

The young girl, who looked about twelve years old, had her hair braided into two long braids that hung down on either side, making her look quite adorable.

When the old man noticed a stranger approaching, he raised his white eyebrows and looked up.

Lee Gwak politely addressed the old man.

“There’s no seat available anywhere else. Would you mind if I joined you?”

“Haha! Not at all.”

The old man readily agreed.

“Thank you.”

With a polite bow, Lee Gwak took a seat.

The young girl looked at Lee Gwak with eyes full of curiosity. Lee Gwak smiled broadly and greeted the girl.

“Hello!”

“Hello…”

The girl blushed as she greeted him.

She seemed quite shy.

Seeing the girl reminded him of Lee Soo-ah.

Their personalities were polar opposites and they looked nothing alike, but perhaps because they were similar in age, he thought of Lee Soo-ah.

Watching his gentle smile, the old man spoke.

“It seems we were destined to share this table. Let’s introduce ourselves. My name is Yang Soo-gon.”

“My name is Lee Jin-mun. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”

Lee Gwak used his alias out of habit.

His real name had become so famous that there was hardly anyone who didn’t know it, making it burdensome to reveal.

“Nice to meet you!”

“Thank you for letting me join you.”

“We’re all travelers under the same sky. We must help each other to live.”

Yang Soo-gon smiled warmly.

His smile had the warm feel of a kindly old grandfather from the countryside. But from the clarity of his gaze, his steady breathing, the calluses on his hands, and the polished flow of his internal energy, it was clear he was no ordinary person.

Yang Soo-gon then gestured to the girl.

“This is my granddaughter, Yang Hye-so. She’s very shy, so please understand if she’s a bit awkward around you.”

“No worries. I have a daughter, Soo-ah, about Hye-so’s age. I completely understand.”

“Ah, so that explains the kindly look you had in your eyes when you saw Hye-so.”

“I parted ways with her before arriving here, and I already miss her.”

“I understand. I also didn’t want to be apart from Hye-soo, so I brought her along.”

Yang Soo-gon looked at Yang Hye-soo with affectionate eyes. Yang Hye-soo smiled back at him slightly.

They were obviously a very affectionate grandfather and granddaughter.

Lee Gwak called out to a passing innkeeper and ordered.

“Stir-fried pork and a plate of xiaolongbao. And bring a good bottle of wine too.”

“Yes! But you’ll have to wait a bit for the food because we’re very busy.”

“Then bring the wine first.”

“Yes! I’ll bring the wine right away.”

The innkeeper ran off quickly to the kitchen. He soon reappeared, carrying a small tray with a liquor bottle and some cups.

As he set the items down, he said:

“This is our inn’s own homemade red wine. You won’t regret trying it.”

“Thank you.”

Lee Gwak handed him a small coin, which he took away with a smile on his face.

Lifting the liquor bottle, Lee Gwak spoke to Yang Soo-gon.

“Elder, would you like a cup?”

“I would, but I have a prior commitment, so I’m afraid I can’t. Perhaps another time.”

Yang Soo-gon declined with a gentle smile.

Lee Gwak did not press any further.

Although drinking is more enjoyable with company, it is not right to insist when someone declines.

Quietly, Lee Gwak poured himself a cup.

True to the innkeeper’s bold claim, the homemade red wine was quite good. He savored it in solitude.

Yang Soo-gon watched Lee Gwak with eyes full of curiosity.

“Lee Jin-mun… That must be an alias.”

Although he wasn’t frequently active in Jianghu, Yang Soo-gon was fairly knowledgeable about its affairs. He had never heard the name Lee Jin-mun before.

Yang Soo-gon guessed that Lee Gwak must be a strong martial artist.

His appearance was certainly ordinary.

His gaze and demeanor were no different from a regular person.

Even so, Yang Soo-gon felt his own senses on high alert.

Like Lee Gwak, Yang Soo-gon also appeared ordinary. However, he was definitely not an average person.

He had once been a famous martial artist—known by everyone throughout the Jianghu—but now he had retired to care for his granddaughter after losing his son and daughter-in-law unexpectedly

Although it had been a long time since he practiced martial arts, his senses were still sharp. They told him that the ordinary man before him was anything but ordinary.

Like himself, the man before him was surely using an alias.

Yang Soo-gon considered asking for Lee Gwak’s real name but decided against it.

It seemed ridiculous to ask someone else’s real name while he himself was using an alias. Pretending ignorance was best for both parties.

Yang Soo-gon turned his attention away from Lee Gwak and looked at his granddaughter. Yang Hye-so was covertly peering at Lee Gwak with curious eyes.

Though exceptionally shy, Yang Hye-so was also quite sensitive. If something made her even slightly uncomfortable, she would keep her distance and not go near it at all.

If Yang Hye-so was showing interest in someone, it meant that the person likely did not have a bad nature.

Soon after, the waiter brought the food ordered by Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak offered the plate of xiaolongbao to Yang Hye-so.

When Yang Hye-so looked at it with wide eyes, Lee Gwak smiled gently.

“It’s a little thank-you for sharing your seat. I hope you enjoy it, Hye-so.”

Yang Hye-so looked at Yang Soo-gon, who nodded, and then she took the plate.

“Thank you for the food.”

Seeing her display such impeccable manners for a child her age, Lee Gwak nodded in agreement.

When Yang Hye-so popped one of the small xiaolongbao into her mouth, her face lit up with delight. The way she chewed with her small lips was unusually cute.

Lee Gwak forcibly turned his gaze away and lifted his cup.

Yang Soo-gon suddenly spoke to Lee Gwak.

“What brings you to this place? Perhaps you’re trying to join Dragon Heaven Valley?”

“Not at all. Would they accept someone of my age into Dragon Heaven Valley?”

“Then?”

“I heard a friend of mine is around this area.”

“So, you’ve come to meet a friend?”

“Yes!”

“You’ve come to a rough place to meet a friend.”

“It seems the situation here is quite bad.”

“In times like these, when you see this many people gathered, it’s never for something good,”

Yang Soo-gon chuckled bitterly as he looked around the inn.

More than half of the people in the inn were armed martial artists. The fact that so many martial artists were gathered in one place was evidence that the situation was far from normal.

Yang Soo-gon continued looking at the martial artists.

“More than half of these people are vagrants who have come to sell their martial prowess. The fact that so many rogues are gathered here proves that what’s happening in this place is serious.”

Indeed, a vagrant market had formed in Taijiang.

The influx of vagrants naturally formed a market.

The very fact that the market was open meant that there was a high demand for it, and it was evidence of the fierce battles that were taking place all over the place.

It all looked peaceful on the surface, but in truth, this was one of the most dangerous places in the entire land.

Yang Soo-gon was relieved to see that, unlike the many other vagrants, Lee Gwak had not come to sell his strength.

Just then, a group entered through the doors of the inn.

They looked around briefly, then headed straight for the table occupied by Lee Gwak and Yang

Soo-gon.

A striking young man, appearing in his mid-to-late twenties, greeted Yang Soo-gon with a respectful bow.

“Lee Woon-sang, chief of the Martial Squad from Dragon Heaven Valley, greets Elder Yang.”

“It’s been a while.”

“The Valley Lord has asked me to escort you, Elder Yang.”

“Ah.”

At Lee Woon-sang’s words, Yang Soo-gon nodded and rose from his seat.

Taking Yang Hye-so by the hand, he looked toward Lee Gwak.

“It seems I have to go. Perhaps we’ll meet again if fate allows.”

“Farewell for now.”

Likewise, Lee Gwak stood and bowed to Yang Soo-gon.

Observing this, Lee Woon-sang’s eyes shone with interest.

He knew that Yang Soo-gon was never one to display such warmth toward just anyone.
