Fortunately, the night passed without any incidents.

At dawn, the Unsan Escort Agency packed up their campsite and set off on their journey.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong rode at the rear of the procession.

Lee Gwak suddenly turned his head to look at Dam Myeong.

Dam Myeong was riding with a composed expression, as if he had never shown any signs of inferiority. He didn’t even glance at Lee Gwak. But Lee Gwak knew that Dam Myeong was still conscious of him.

Shaking his head, Lee Gwak once again realized that life wasn’t easy.

At that moment, Go Chang-seon, who was leading the group, rode up to Lee Gwak.

“Could I have a moment of your time?”

“What’s the matter?”

“The master wants to see you briefly.”

“Hmm!”

“I promise I won’t take much of your time.”

“Alright.”

Lee Gwak agreed reluctantly.

He guided his horse next to the carriage where Nam Woo-chang was riding. The window opened, and Nam Woo-chang stuck his face out.

“Sorry to trouble you, Master Lee!”

“Not at all. What is it?”

“Since we’re nearing the Nine Dragons Clan, I wanted to know your intentions. Are you thinking of joining them?”

“No.”

At Lee Gwak’s firm answer, Nam Woo-chang’s eyes sparkled.

“Then how about our Unsan Escort Agency? If you decide to join us, I promise to offer you the best treatment. With you, our agency would become the foremost escort agency in the Jianghu.”

“My apologies.”

“Please reconsider. There’s nowhere else in the world that would treat you as generously as we would.”

“I’ll say it again: I have no intention of joining any sect. I’m sorry.”

“Ah!”

Nam Woo-chang sighed deeply.

He had been eagerly waiting for an opportunity to make this proposal to Lee Gwak. But since Lee Gwak only associated with the vagrants, he couldn’t find the chance, so he had to force the issue now.

“I’m sorry. I guess I was too forward.”

“It’s alright.”

“But we can still keep in touch, right? I’d like to know you for a long time.”

“If I ever pass through Lake Hong again, I will definitely come to see you.”

“Whew! Understood.”

Nam Woo-chang let out a sigh.

In the end, he didn’t get any definite answer.

‘What a pity. If only I had more time…’

He acknowledged that he had been too hasty.

People like Lee Gwak opened their hearts more easily when approached slowly over time rather than hastily.

Even though he knew that, he had approached urgently because of his nephew. He thought that if Lee Gwak became a mentor to Nam Jin-woon, it would greatly help his progress.

‘It can’t be helped.’

But as things stood, it was impossible to persuade Lee Gwak any further.

Lee Gwak said to Nam Woo-chang, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave.”

“Sigh! Please, go ahead.”

Leaving Nam Woo-chang behind, Lee Gwak returned to Lee Cheong’s side. Lee Cheong didn’t bother to ask what conversation had taken place in the carriage. He could guess even without Lee Gwak telling him.

‘Everyone’s making a fuss over Dad. But do they know? That Dad’s real skills are far beyond that.’

The only person here who knew Lee Gwak’s true martial prowess was Lee Cheong.

For some reason, Lee Cheong’s chest swelled with pride.

No matter how mature he acted, in the end, Lee Cheong was still a child.

He couldn’t hide his proud expression.

At that moment, the voice of the head escort, Go Chang-seon, broke into Lee Cheong’s thoughts.

“There’s the Nine Dragons Clan. We’ve reached our destination.”

“Wow!”

At the sight of the massive fortress walls in the distance, the escorts of the Unsan Escort Agency cheered.

It was the final destination of their escort mission, the Nine Dragons Clan.

Lee Cheong pulled himself together and looked at the Nine Dragons Clan.

“Wow!”

An exclamation burst from his lips.

The grandeur of the yellowish-brown fortress walls overwhelmed the onlookers.

Lee Cheong had been held captive for a long time in the White Light Sect, one of the Ten Evils like the Nine Dragons Clan. The main castle of the White Light Sect, (Flower Castle), was as splendid and beautiful as entering a garden, just like its name.

Of course, contrary to its name, the surroundings were full of treacherous traps and formations, but nevertheless, its appearance was astonishingly beautiful. But the Nine Dragons Clan was different.

It was so crude that there was no trace of aesthetic design. The appearance of the ochre-colored old castle was desolate. But instead, it exuded an overwhelming majesty that could not be found in any other castle.

Even seeing it from afar, the imposing presence of the Nine Dragons Clan was enough to take one’s breath away.

As people approached, they felt their bodies and minds shrink.

The escorts of Unsan Escort Agency, seasoned martial artists, and even the vagrants who prided themselves surviving through all sorts of hardships felt their lips dry up. It wasn’t hard to imagine the emotions running through young Lee Cheong.

Lee Cheong’s shoulders shivered slightly. But when Lee Gwak took his hand, his trembling ceased as if by magic.

“Father!”

The mere presence of Lee Gwak beside him was enough to relieve the suffocating pressure of the Nine Dragons Clan.

Lee Gwak spoke calmly.

“There is no need to be afraid. The Nine Dragons Clan is just another place where people live. They are not fundamentally different from you. To fear them before you’ve even faced them is the height of foolishness.

What’s important is your steadfast heart, not the opponent’s strength or the atmosphere. Understood?”

“Yes! I’ll keep that in mind.”

Lee Cheong nodded firmly.

Lee Gwak smiled.

Being young, he was still easily swayed by the surrounding atmosphere, but fundamentally, Lee Cheong had a firm nature. With a little more guidance, he would be more than capable.

As the procession of the Unsan Escort Agency drew closer, the martial artists guarding the gates of the Nine Dragons Clan shouted loudly.

“Stop! State your identity and where you’re from.”

“We are escorts from the Unsan Escort Agency. We’ve come to deliver a consigned item to the Nine Dragons Clan, so please open the gates.”

Head escort Go Chan Seong stepped forward and replied.

“Wait a moment. We’ll inform you inside.”

One of the martial artists guarding the main gate hurriedly ran into the fortress.

After a while, the massive main gate opened wide with a heavy sound. A middle-aged man with a commanding presence appeared, flanked by dozens of subordinates.

He walked straight toward the Unsan Escort Agency.

“I am So Gong-yeol, the general manager of the Nine Dragons Clan. Did you say you are the Unsan Escort Agency?”

“I am Nam Woo-chang, the master of the Unsan Escort Agency. We have come from Lake Hong, entrusted with a consigned item.”

“Nice to meet you, Master Nam. You must have had a hard journey. Please, come inside.”

So Gong-yeol greeted warmly, grabbing Nam Woo-chang’s hand.

He had been eagerly waiting for the Unsan Escort Agency to arrive.

So Gong-yeol glanced subtly at the carriages.

“Is the consigned item loaded in those carriages?”

“Indeed.”

“Master Nam, you’ve done a great service. Thank you for your hard work.”

So Gong-yeol praised Nam Woo-chang.

With the gold bars loaded in the carriages, the Nine Dragons Clan wouldn’t have to worry about finances for several years. As the general manager overseeing the affairs of the Nine Dragons Clan, there was nothing better.

He had been anxiously awaiting this moment ever since making the secret pact with Myriad Merchant Troupe.

“Were there any problems on the way?”

“We were attacked by unidentified assailants.”

“Oh dear?”

“Fortunately, we were able to repel the enemies, but many were killed or injured. Still, I’m relieved that we completed the escort mission safely.”

“Are you saying some bastards dared to target the gold bars coming to our sect? Was it the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

“That, we do not know.”

Nam Woo-chang shook his head.

“Anyway, thank you for your hard work. Let’s talk more inside. I’ll prepare the best accommodations, so have your subordinates rest there. We’ll take care of moving the goods.”

“Understood.”

“Haha! Our sect will now spread its wings. It’s all thanks to the Unsan Escort Agency.”

So Gong-yeol laughed heartily.

When the Myriad Merchant Troupe had said they’d send an enormous amount of gold through an ordinary escort agency, he couldn’t believe it. It was a time when even mobilizing elite forces wouldn’t be enough to deceive the Jade Heaven Alliance, so of course, he opposed it.

But despite the Nine Dragons Clan’s opposition, the Myriad Merchant Troupe sent the gold through the Unsan Escort Agency, and the agency successfully completed their mission.

‘Did the Unsan Escort Agency have such power? I should strengthen our friendship for the future.’

Therefore, So Gong-yeol showed an exceptionally friendly attitude toward Nam Woo-chang. Deeply moved by his sincere hospitality, Nam Woo-chang followed him gladly.

As Nam Woo-chang and So Gong-yeol entered the Nine Dragons Clan together, one of So Gong-yeol’s subordinates addressed Go Chang-seon and the escorts.

“Leave the goods here and follow us. We will escort you to the guest accommodations.”

“Understood.”

Hearing that they would take care of the consigned items, he felt relaxed.

Just as he was about to follow So Gong-yeol’s subordinates, Go Chang-seon paused and looked back at Lee Gwak.

“What will you do? Will you come inside?”

Originally, only the escorts of the Unsan Escort Agency could enter the Nine Dragons Clan. It wasn’t a place where vagrants could enter recklessly. But parting with Lee Gwak like this made him uneasy about losing such a talent.

He glanced at Lee Gwak with a hopeful expression. But Lee Gwak’s reply deviated from his expectations.

“I have somewhere else to go.”

“Hmm! You’re saying you won’t go in?”

“That’s right.”

“If you change your mind, come find me. We’ll be staying here for a few days.”

Go Chang-seon had his subordinate pay Lee Gwak his wages. It was much more than the originally agreed amount. He gave extra because of Lee Gwak’s contributions.

Lee Gwak put it in his pocket without even checking the amount.

“Then we’ll be going. See you again.”

“Hmm!”

Go Chang-seon watched Lee Gwak’s receding figure with eyes full of regret.

The subordinate of So Gong-yeol next to him had a puzzled expression.

‘Wasn’t he just an ordinary vagrant?’

It seemed unlikely that the head of the Unsan Escort Agency would show such regret for a mere vagrant.

His eyes lingered on the receding figures of Lee Gwak and his son, their backs etched in his memory like a dagger.

“His name is Lee Jin-mun. He’s someone we should carefully keep an eye on.”

The place where the Nine Dragons Clan stood was originally just a barren wilderness. The ground was a dusty yellow-brown, parched and desolate. Nothing could grow there, not crops nor weeds, and it was a place so devoid of life that even animals avoided it.

It was so desolate that people called it the Land of Death and avoided approaching it. When a huge fortress was built in such an uninhabited place, and the Nine Dragons Clan declared its establishment, everyone called it madness.

That’s how barren the place was.

Most people thought the Nine Dragons Clan wouldn’t last long. But the sect rapidly expanded its power and prospered. Then, many people came seeking to join, and naturally, a large city formed.

Over a century later, the city had expanded to a size beyond people’s imagination, and it came to be known as the Nine Dragons Nest.

The city was home to countless people, and their living conditions varied by social status. Those with high status or wealth settled in the northern streets, while the poor and vagrants gathered in the southern streets.

Lee Gwak’s destination was the southern district, specifically, the Hungry Ghost Road, famous for being populated by many of the poorest residents.

Originally called the Changhyun road, it had earned its new name during a famine thirty years ago, and people died of starvation one after another. Although the Nine Dragons Clan provided relief, the damage was great, and especially in Changhyun Road, where many poor people lived, numerous people died of starvation.

After that, it was called the Hungry Ghost Road because it was said that starving ghosts roamed there.

Perhaps due to such a heartbreaking history, people avoided entering the Road. It was frequented only by those with nowhere else to turn—such as the poor, criminals, and vagabonds.

It was extremely rare for people riding horses to appear in the Hungry Ghost Road, where those who had nothing gathered to live.

“A horse?”

“Someone actually came here on horseback?”

People’s eyes widened.

Their gazes turned to a man and a boy calmly riding a horse down the street. It was none other than Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong.

A large man stepped in front of Lee Gwak, blocking his path.

“Hey there, mister! It’s a bit much to ride horses here. I’ll look after them for you, so why don’t you leave them with me?”

He beckoned to Lee Gwak with his finger.

The Hungry Ghost Road was a place ruled by the law of strength. Here, the strong had the right to possess everything, and the man was considered quite strong even in this place.

Blue-Blooded Ghost Oh Gu-su.

He reached out to grab the horses’ reins as if taking his own belongings.

Thwack!

“Ugh!”

At that moment, a dull sound and a scream erupted simultaneously.

Lee Gwak’s finger strike had hit the back of Oh Gu-su’s head. Oh Gu-su rolled his eyes back

and lost consciousness on the spot.

“What the hell? You bastard!”

“Are you looking for trouble?”

Those who had been watching Oh Gu-su’s actions with interest were startled and reached for their weapons.

While they could tolerate fighting and killing among themselves, they could never allow an outsider to harm someone from the Hungry Ghost Road.

If one person was attacked, all of Hungry Ghost Road would move.

That was the law of Hungry Ghost Road. And now, Lee Gwak’s actions were enough to make the entire Hungry Ghost Road his enemy.

As they began to emit fierce killing intent towards Lee Gwak, a cold voice suddenly rang out.

“Stop it, all of you. Unless you want to end up crippled.”

A man in shabby attire appeared.

Those who had shown hostility toward Lee Gwak snapped at him.

“What? Are you saying we can’t handle a single guy?”

“That’s right! Even if all of you here charge at him, you won’t beat that man. You’ll be lucky if you don’t end up crippled.”

“Is that so…”

Distrust flickered across their faces. But they couldn’t act rashly; that’s how much they trusted the man’s words.

The man smirked as he looked at the hesitant crowd. He walked past them and approached Lee Gwak.

At that moment, a smile appeared on Lee Gwak’s lips.

“Long time no see, brother!”

“You look well.”

The man smiling at Lee Gwak was none other than Nam Woo-gyeong.

He spread his arms wide to greet Lee Gwak.
