The arrival of Mok Cheon-gang, Dam Su-rin, Seo Jong-myeong, and Ki Jin-hwi brought new vitality to the Mad Martial Sect.

Mok Cheon-gang was a reassuring presence, and Dam Su-rin’s divine medical skills gave many people a sense of security.

Seo Jong-myeong began working with Lim So-bo to review the Sect’s systems and make them more efficient.

Ki Jin-hwi, with his natural charisma, quickly grew close to the members. Among them, Seok Yi-cheon, also from the 13th Squad, welcomed Ki Jin-hwi the most warmly. The two stuck together like long-lost lovers.

The one who benefited most from their arrival was Lim So-bo.

With Mok Cheon-gang, Dam Su-rin, Seo Jong-myeong, and Ki Jin-hwi seamlessly taking over her duties, she was freed from trivial tasks and could focus solely on big-picture planning.

Meanwhile, Lee Gwak organized the insights he had gained from his battles with Jin Gwang-hon and Yang Gwang-baek while training the disciples of the Mad Martial Sect.

Thanks to his efforts, the young disciples grew stronger by the day.

Pi Jin-ui and Jo So-hye, Lee Gwak’s personal disciples, stood out the most among them. Their skills rapidly grew, threatening even the senior masters. Their progress brought Lee Gwak great joy.

Although they weren’t prodigies who learned ten things from one, they thoroughly absorbed what was taught, and that alone made Lee Gwak feel it was worth teaching them.

After instructing the two, Lee Gwak would often walk to the rear courtyard with Lee Cheong by his side.

In truth, the one who had grown the most explosively was Lee Cheong. His martial prowess had skyrocketed, far surpassing even Pi Jin-wi and Jo So-hye. Yet he carefully concealed his growth from outsiders.

Like Lee Gwak, Lee Cheong disliked revealing himself to others.

Having endured countless hardships from a young age, it had become second nature for him to hide at least 30% of his true strength.

Lee Cheong stayed close to Lee Gwak almost all day.

When Lee Gwak trained, Lee Cheong trained; when Lee Gwak taught his disciples, Lee Cheong joined in to learn as well. In this way, he absorbed everything from Lee Gwak at remarkable speed.

After taking Lee Cheong to Han So-cheon, Lee Gwak headed for the main hall.

Even though he had entrusted the internal affairs of the sect entirely to Lim So-bo, he still had to handle important matters personally.

“Oraboni! Welcome.”

As soon as Lee Gwak entered, Lim So-bo greeted him with a serious expression. Beside her stood a familiar man.

“Brother! You came without any notice?”

Lee Gwak smiled and approached him.

“It’s been a while.”

The man who nodded in greeting was Nam Woo-gyeong, leader of the Hao Clan.

“When did you arrive?”

“Just now. I thought about sending word, but since I knew you’d be here around this time, I waited.”

Lee Gwak’s face slightly tensed. Nam Woo-gyeong’s energy felt off.

“What’s going on?”

“It looks like the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Celestial Demon Troupe will clash again—this time at Dongting Lake, Jade Heaven Alliance’s home turf.”

“At Dongting Lake?”

“Yes. The Celestial Demon Troupe’s forces have gathered in Changde, west of Dongting Lake.”

Dongting’s eastern side, Yueyang, was home to the Jade Heaven Alliance. Changde was the city on the opposite side and within Jade Heaven Alliance’s sphere of influence.

“Did the Jade Heaven Alliance just stand by and watch while theCelestial Demon Troupe assembled their forces in Changde?”

“If they’d known, they would’ve stopped it.”

“Are you saying they didn’t realize until the Celestial Demon Troupe had already set up camp? How is that possible?”

“It just proves how skilled the Celestial Demon Troupe’s strategists are. And how dull the Jade Heaven Alliance’s intelligence network has become.”

“Still…”

“They cleverly dispersed their forces and moved them covertly to Changde. Even the mighty Jade Heaven Alliance was completely blindsided.”

Lee Gwak’s gaze darkened at Nam Woo-gyeong’s calm words.

‘Hao Clan likely played a role in weakening the Jade Heaven Alliance’s intelligence network.’

More accurately, it was Nam Woo-gyeong’s doing.

After his master, Sim Wol, was killed by Ja Hong-cheon, Nam Woo-gyeong had bided his time, waiting for revenge. Though he should have supported the Jade Heaven Alliance for the sake of the world, his hatred ran too deep. The members of Hao Clan felt the same.

They hadn’t actively sabotaged the Jade Heaven Alliance’s intelligence network, but they hadn’t helped either. As a result, the Alliance had been left blind.

And now, the Celestial Demon Troupe had set up camp right at their doorstep.

In over a hundred years since the Jade Heaven Alliance established itself in Yueyang, this was the first time such a direct threat had emerged.

“The Jade Heaven Alliance must be in chaos.”

“Exactly. They’re in an uproar.”

Nam Woo-gyeong smiled bitterly. Though he should have felt satisfaction seeing the Alliance in trouble, the thought of the ensuing chaos in the martial world left him conflicted.

“Sigh… I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing.”

“Brother?”

“Sorry. You must be even more conflicted than I am.”

“Not at all.”

Lee Gwak shook his head.

Nam Woo-gyeong wasn’t asking Lee Gwak for an answer. He just needed someone to listen to his complaints.

Understanding that, Lee Gwak said nothing and simply looked at him.

After a moment of silence, Lee Gwak spoke first.

“Who do you think will win?”

“Hard to say. The Celestial Demon Troupe has the advantage for now, but Jade Heaven Alliance still holds the home turf. They’ve built up secret forces around Dongting Lake. If they use those, they won’t go down easily.”

“It could turn into a prolonged battle.”

“It all depends on the Seven Sects—whether they intervene or continue to watch. Their decision will determine the direction of the war. Considering the losses they suffered, though, I doubt they’ll jump in easily.

“They’re probably as conflicted as you.”

“Most likely. Hah…”

Nam Woo-gyeong sighed again.

The Seven Clans had shown no sign of movement. Myriad Merchant Troupe and Thousand Kingdom School, both leaderless, were still reorganizing. The Dragon Heaven Valley was isolated and needed help. Southward, the Martial Sword Troupe had locked its gates, and the Nine Dragon Clan was lying low. Sky High Castle also remained quiet.

Lee Gwak looked at Nam Woo-gyeong and cautiously spoke.

“You seem overwhelmed. Why not rest here for a while?”

“Would that be all right?”

“Of course.”

“Thank you.”

Nam Woo-gyeong smiled faintly.

Hao Clan had plenty of safe houses, but none gave him the same sense of security as this place. Perhaps it was because Lee Gwak was here.

Lee Gwak gave him the best lodging in his sect.

And the happiest to see Nam Woo-gyeong arrive was, of course, Im Sobo. Though the Hao Clan had been helping them already, nothing beats getting help directly from its leader.

She was probably already scheming how to wring every last drop of use from him and his clan.

Lee Gwak found the thought of their meeting amusing.

Baekun Manor, located on the western shore of Dongting Lake, was a grand historic estate. Renowned for its size and beauty, it had long been a beloved retreat for poets and artists.

But that picturesque scene no longer existed.

Baekun Manor had changed hands.

The new owner had swept away all the unnecessary decorations and art, replacing them with countless warriors.

Each one radiated a formidable presence; they were Celestial Demon Troupe’s soldiers.

The true master of Baekun was Go Geom-wol, the leader of Celestial Demon Troupe.

During the ongoing war with the Jade Heaven Alliance, Jin Eui-hon, the leader of the Blood Heaven Institute of Celestial Demon Troupe, moved discreetly.

He secretly infiltrated Dongting to search for a suitable headquarters and chose Baekun Manor.

He purchased it for a substantial sum and secretly transformed it into a fortress.

The manor’s appeal wasn’t just its size; it was built on a slope overlooking the lake, making it ideal for surveillance and defense.

While Jade Heaven Alliance’s forces clashed with the Celestial Demon Troupe elsewhere, Jin prepared to welcome the rest of his troops.

He cleared the manor, built hidden barracks, and secured it to accommodate nearly ten thousand soldiers.

He completed these preparations without alerting Jade Heaven Alliance’s intelligence network, allowing Celestial Demon Troupe’s troops to trickle in and fully recover there.

“You’ve done well.”

“You did all the work, Lord. I just followed orders.”

Go Geom-wol praised him, and Jin Eui-hon responded humbly.

Beside him stood the elite of the Celestial Demon Troupe—the Two Palaces, Three Pavilions, Four Towers, and Five Halls—all gathered in one place.

Though they looked exhausted from the covert journey, their eyes burned with intensity.

Never before in the troupe’s long history had they come this close to the Jade Heaven Alliance.

It had taken over a century to reach this point.

The leaders’ faces reflected mixed emotions.

Go Geom-wol asked Jin Eui-hon,

“How many of our forces have arrived?”

“Over eighty percent. The rest will join within days.”

“What of the Jade Heaven Alliance’s movements?”

“They’re also gathering their forces.”

“It’s natural.”

Go Geom-wol nodded and walked to the window.

Beyond it stretched the vast Dongting Lake. OTheir sworn enemy, the Jade Heaven Alliance, lay on the other side.

It was too far away to see with the naked eye, but he could sense their presence.

Go Geom-wol gazed silently in their direction while the leaders of his sect watched his back with bated breath.

Without any grand gestures or words, an aura of absolute authority naturally emanated from him.

In just a few months, Go Geom-wol had accomplished what no one else had in a hundred years.

He had brought the Celestial Demon Troupe back to the heart of the Jianghu. Of course, total victory over the Jade Heaven Alliance was still needed, but this first step was monumental.

To them, Go Geom-wol was more than just a tyrant who seized power. He was the absolute leader who would fulfill Celestial Demon Troupe’s dream.

After a long silence, Go Geom-wol finally spoke.

“My master is dead.”

“…”

“Yang Gwang-baek of the true demon palace has also passed away.”

“…”

The shock was so great, no one could speak.

They had expected Jin Gwang-hon’s death. But Yang Gwang-baek’s? That was a crushing blow.

Rage surged especially among the Ten Blood Demons and the true demon palace martial artists.

“Who? Who dared to kill our lord?”

Lee Sin-chung, the foremost of the Ten Blood Demons, spoke for them all.

“Lee Gwak.”

“The Sura Blade?”

“Yes. Lee Gwak killed my Master and Elder Yang.”

“Send me to the Mad Martial Sect. I’ll bring back his head.”

“No, send me. I’ll avenge them.”

“Leader! Let me go.”

The Ten Blood Demons clamored to be dispatched. But Go Geom-wol remained unfazed.

“I will not send anyone to the Mad Martial Sect. Lee Gwak and his remote sect are not our concern now.”

“But…”

“Revenge can wait. The priority is toppling Jade Heaven Alliance. Lee Gwak comes after.”

“Ah…”

“Understood…”

The Ten Blood Demons fell silent, reluctantly.

“Jin Eui-hon!”

“Yes, Lord!”

“We attack Jade Heaven Alliance at dawn tomorrow.”

“So soon? Understood. I will make the preparations.”

Jin Ei-hon bowed deeply in acknowledgment.

Go Geom-wol swept his gaze across the assembly.

“Since we’ve entered their territory uninvited, we ought to greet them properly first.”

The cold smile curling his lips sent a shiver down everyone’s spines.

The leaders dropped to one knee in unison and responded:

“We obey the Leader’s command!”

Their voices boomed through the hall like thunder.

The next dawn, the Celestial Demon Troupe crossed Dongting Lake and attacked the Jade Heaven Alliance.

The once-serene blue waters of the lake turned crimson with blood, and countless corpses floated upon its surface.

Thus, the final act of the Age of Chaos had begun.
