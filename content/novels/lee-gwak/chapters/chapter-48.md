Manhwa: Chapter 49

Fortunately, the Jade Heaven Alliance did not severely reprimand Ma Duwon. The trap mechanism had not fully activated, and there was no significant damage.

Instead, they ordered Ma Duwon to make a perfect clean-up.

As a result, Ma Duwon had to spend another fortnight repairing the mechanism. However, he didnt complain.

He needed to repair the traps that Lee Gwak had damaged anyway and wanted to fully fix the malfunctioning mechanisms.

This part is crucial. Because its the part that gathers together the scattered power. Its only through this part can the force be evenly distributed throughout the mechanism.

Look closely here. This part, see how its different from the others?

Ma Duwons attitude towards Lee Gwak had changed. He explained every little detail to him, even the smallest ones.

Lee Gwak did not refuse Ma Duwons teachings.

Until now, he had only been able to learn by stealing glances and eavesdropping, but now he didnt have to. If he had any questions, he would ask, and Ma Duwon would explain in detail.

When all the repairs to the mechanisms were finally completed, Lee Gwaks knowledge about mechanisms had reached an incomparably higher level of achievement.

Ma Duwon seemed not content with just passing on his knowledge about mechanical traps. He secretly called Lee Gwak and handed him something.

What is this?

A secret manual!

These are secret manuals kept in the Creation Pavilion.

Lee Gwak was so taken aback by Ma Duwons unexpected words that he couldnt find anything to say. Then Ma Duwon laughed.

Heh heh! No need to be so burdened. Its not some extraordinary technique.

People often think the Creation Pavilion is just for organizing events and repairing broken mechanisms. Sure, thats also true. But if we want to properly support the Jade Heaven Alliance, a martial arts organization, we need to have some knowledge of martial arts. I, myself, never felt the need to learn it, but many have learned martial arts. And there are those who research it. These manuals are their research results. Theyre not that remarkable, but still useful to learn.

Thank you.

Lee Gwak did not refuse this time.

His Eight Sects Sword Art had been stagnating. He had mastered the basic forms, but couldnt break through to a higher level. So, Lee Gwak had been learning the Invisible Spider Puncture Art, looking and hoping for a breakthrough.

He was in desperate need of a breakthrough.

Lee Gwak looked at the secret manuals Ma Duwon handed to him.

Thunder Blade Arts.

Sun Splitting Sword Art.

Floating Cloud Stride.

Each martial arts manual bore an extraordinary name.

In fact, these three martial arts were recognized as superior techniques even in the martial world. They were incomparable to the manuals Lee Gwak had previously acquired from the Outer Halls library.

Is it really okay for you to give these books to me?

Heh heh! Despite my appearance, my position in the Creation Pavilion is quite high. Giving these away wont be much of a problem.

Then, I gratefully accept them.

Heh heh! Thats the spirit.

Ma Duwon smiled contentedly.

This was the man who hadnt shown any sign of emotional disturbance even when the trap mechanism had activated and everyone was in danger. Yet now, that very man was happily receiving three secret manuals. Just seeing his face and reaction made Ma Duwon very happy.

This guy is truly a natural-born martial fanatic. Hes truly obsessed with martial arts.

Ma Duwon was genuinely curious about how much more Lee Gwak would achieve.

Youve worked hard during this time. You must be curious about the manuals, so go ahead and take a look.

Thank you.

Feel free to visit often when youre bored.

I will visit you often.

Good! Ill arrange for you to be assigned here, so just relax and read the manuals without any worries. No one will come looking for you for a while.

Thank you for your consideration.

After giving a formal palm and fist salute to Ma Duwon, Lee Gwak stepped outside. The martial arts manuals felt heavy in his arms.

After leaving the Outer Hall, Lee Gwak considered heading straight home but instead turned in a different direction.

He was heading to the Yin Family Weapon House, located on the outskirts beyond the Outer Hall. It was where he had previously purchased the sword he had been using.

His sword, made of five-metal alloy, had been destroyed under the weight of an iron gate, necessitating a new one. Lee Gwak hoped to find a suitable replacement at the Yin Family Weapon House.

Welcome! Oh, its you?

As soon as he entered, a neatly dressed merchant recognized him and seemed pleased.

You remember me?

Didnt you buy a sword here about three or four years ago?

You have an impressive memory. Yes, thats correct.

What brings you here? Has the sword you bought last time already broken?

Hmm! What do you have to be sorry about? Even if its made of the best quality steel, theres a limit to its durability, and its natural for it to eventually break. Please, take a look and choose something that catches your eye.

Thank you.

Lee Gwak thanked the merchant and began examining the items on display.

There was a variety of weapons, including swords, blades, sabers, spears, and axes. However, Lee Gwak only focused on the swords.

There were seven swords on the shelf. Lee Gwak picked them up one by one and examined them carefully. He checked the weight and balance, the strength of the sword, the sharpness, and the fit of the handle.

Lee Gwak paid particular attention to the sixth sword he picked up.

Firstly, he liked the handle. Although he didnt know what kind of leather it was made from, it felt comfortably snug in his hand, and most importantly, the weight distribution and balance were just right.

The blade was slightly coarse, but that was no concern, as Lee Gwak could sharpen it himself.

As he lightly swung the sword to test it

Thats a fine sword.

A clear voice suddenly came from behind him.

Turning around, Lee Gwak saw a woman dressed in light clothing. But despite her plain attire, her appearance was nothing out of the ordinary.

She had a dainty face, eyes as cold as the moon in the autumn sky, and a stoic posture that made her look like a plum blossom blooming alone in the midst of winter.

Lee Gwak recognized the womans identity at a glance.

Muk Seon-wol.

She was indeed Muk Seon-wol, the Dark Moon Fairy.

Given the significant time that had passed, Lee Gwak thought Muk Seon-wol might have left the Jade Heaven Alliance. However, contrary to his expectations, she was still here.

Lee Gwak respectfully greeted Muk Seon-wol with a formal palm and fist salute.

You still remember me?

How could I forget Lady Muk?

Its good to see you, Squad Leader Lee. I truly didnt expect to meet you here.

But what brings Lady Muk to this place?

Im here on business, too.

Muk Seon-wol replied with a faint smile. Her smile, added to her already beautiful face, seemed to brighten the entire Yin Family Weapon House.

The merchant then greeted Muk Seon-wol. 𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝚠𝚎𝚋𝗻𝗼𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝚘𝐦

Oh, Lady Muk, youre here.

Its been a long time. Almost five years, I believe.

Four years and eight months to be exact.

You havent changed. How is Master Yin?

I heard from him the other day, and hes fortunately doing well.

I would like to meet Master Yin sometime.

Ill include your regards in the letter I would send to the family.

Thank you.

Muk Seon-wol nodded in response to the merchants words.

Lee Gwak quietly observed the two of them. From their exchange, it was clear they had known each other for a long time.

The merchant cautiously asked,

But what brings you here, Lady Muk?

Ah! Ive come to ask you for a favor.

Muk Seon-wol suddenly unbuckled her belt.

A clear metallic sound rang out. Only then did Lee Gwak realize that her belt was not made of fabric but was an unusual artifact made of thin metal pieces joined together.

Muk Seon-wol handed the metal belt to the merchant.

The joints have become loose. Would it be possible for you to repair it?

The merchants eyes grew serious as he held the belt.

The belt he was holding was by no means ordinary. It was a Serpentine Waist Sword, 4 made of thin metal plates intricately woven together.

Inside the thin plates were threads like silver threads or whips, allowing it to move like a snake and be used as a belt under normal circumstances. However, when infused with internal energy, the metal plates could be joined together to form a complete sword.

Its utility was limitless, but it was equally challenging to use and master. Moreover, without strong internal energy backing it, it couldnt be utilized as a sword.

The fact that Muk Seon-wol used a Serpentine Waist Sword as a weapon was proof that she possessed strong enough internal energy and formidable martial arts skills.

The merchant inspected the Serpentine Waist Sword carefully.

This was no ordinary item but Muk Seon-wols beloved weapon. There was no room for even the slightest error.

After meticulously examining it for a while, the merchant spoke.

I think we can repair it here in our workshop, however, to do it perfectly, we would need about two days. Would that be alright?

Thats fine. Just make sure its perfectly cared for.

Ill do my best.

The merchant bowed slightly in response to Muk Seon-wols request.

His attentive manner indicated the significant influence Muk Seon-wol held in the martial world.

When their conversation ended, Lee Gwak spoke to the merchant.

I would like to purchase this sword.

Oh, sorry! I forgot you were here.

Im sorry, Squad Leader Lee. You were here first.

Both the merchant and Muk Seon-wol apologized simultaneously, to which Lee Gwak shook his head.

Its fine. How much should I pay?

The merchant furrowed his brows for a moment before replying,

Normally, Id ask for five silver coins, but since Ive kept you waiting, I can give it to you for four.

Lee Gwak didnt hesitate and paid immediately.

That was how much he liked the sword.

It might not compare to the renowned swords in Jianghu, but it suited his hand well. Lee Gwak believed that a weapon fitting ones hand was a good weapon.

Its a fine piece, use it well.

At the merchants words, Lee Gwak nodded in agreement. He then said,

Then, I will be on my way.

Safe travels.

Lets go together, Squad Leader Lee.

Muk Seon-wol followed Lee Gwak out. Though Lee Gwak found her presence somewhat burdensome, he tried not to pay much attention to it.

After all, she belonged to a different world than his. Their paths might cross occasionally, but there was no intertwining of their lives.

Lee Gwak was more curious about the true nature of the Yin Family Weapon House and the merchant. Considering their close relationship with Muk Seon-wol, a successor of the Dragon Sky Valley, one of the Ten Supremes, they seemed to be more than ordinary.

Really, the martial world is full of surprises. I wonder how many masters and sects are lurking everywhere?

Muk Seon-wols voice soon broke through Lee Gwaks thoughts.

By the way Squad Leader Lee, how did you happen to come to the Yin Family Weapon House?

I just happened to stop by.

Just by chance?

If thats really the case, then Squad Leader Lee, you are quite the lucky one.

Yes! Even though the Yin Family Weapon House is not widely known, the quality of the weapons they produce is exceptionally high. There are probably hardly any workshops that can match the ones produced by the Yin Family Weapon House.

Lee Gwak nodded at Muk Seon-wols explanation.

He had already used their weapons before, so he knew better than anyone the quality of the weapons produced by the Yin Family Weapon House.

Lee Gwak quietly caressed the sword, while Muk Seon-wol silently observed him.

What an interesting man.

When people see her for the first time, they would normally be drawn to her beautiful appearance. Everyone she had encountered so far was like that.

They would either be drawn to her captivating looks or her extraordinary background rather than her martial arts skills. Therefore, they would approach her, desperately hoping to make a good impression on her. Unfortunately, there were no exceptions. But Lee Gwak was different.

He only glanced at her face for a moment, then shifted his entire attention to the sword in her hand.

It was clear from a glance that he had no interest in her.

Muk Seon-wol watched Lee Gwak closely.

She had heard that he was an ordinary squad leader from the Outer Hall, but there was extraordinary about him that caught her attention. It was especially evident in his deep and profound eyes. Looking into his eyes, it was hard to believe he was merely a warrior of the Outer Hall.

They soon came to a fork in the road.

One path led to the northern street where Lee Gwak lived, and the other led to the outer city of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Lee Gwak said to Muk Seon-wol,

I must go this way. Please be careful on your way back, Lady Muk.

See you next time, Squad Leader Lee.

Lee Gwak bowed in goodbye to Muk Seon-wol before proceeding to walk toward his own house. Muk Seon-wol watched his retreating figure for a moment before returning to the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Dan Li-yeon, also known as the Black Martial Empress, greeted her.

What are you doing here? I told you to leave your weapon at a workshop in the Inner Court.

Im more comfortable dealing with the place Ive always traded with.

Anyway, will they be able to fix it properly?

Why are you so late then?

I just met someone interesting.

Dan Li-yeon blinked in surprise.
