Woo Mun Pae stared at Lee Gwak in disbelief.

Leaving the crumbling Gung Choo-san behind, Lee Gwak was walking towards him. The large pillar still rested on his shoulders.

Though only a few weapons remained lodged in the pillar, no one dared call his appearance unsightly.

The battlefield, once filled with shouts and the clash of steel, had fallen eerily silent.

Everyone held their breath as they watched Lee Gwak.

He walked between them.

No one tried to stop or attack him.

They had clearly seen what happened to those who had attacked Lee Gwak before.

Lee Gwak headed straight for Woo Mun Pae.

It was clear to everyone that Woo Mun Pae was his target.

The eyes of the crowd now shifted toWoo Mun-pae.

In an instant,Woo Mun-pae’s anger exploded.

“What are you doing? Kill him now!”

“Y-yes, Lord Woo!”

Hearing his command, the martial artists of the Martial Sword Troupe reluctantly began to move.

“Everyone, stop.”

The woman who appeared with a lion-like roar was Sa Yeon-hee.

Her appearance shockedWoo Mun-pae the most.

“What are you doing, Sa Yeon-hee?”

But Sa yeon-hee did not answer. She simply walked towards Lee Gwak.

The warriors of Martial Sword Troupe stood there, unsure of what to do in her presence.

By then, Lee Gwak was only a few steps away from Woo Mun-pae.

Even without words, everyone could sense just how great his fury was.

A quiet man’s anger is always the most terrifying.

Sa Yeon-hee realized this as she looked at Lee Gwak.

Normally, Lee Gwak was not one to lose his temper or show his emotions easily. Even if it meant suffering a small loss, he preferred to solve things with reason.

Some found him frustrating for this.

He often tried to solve problems through dialogue, which could be resolved quickly with martial arts. That’s why some people took him lightly or made fun of him.

Now they will learn.

What happens when a quiet man finally loses his temper.

Sa Yeon-hee found the silent, approaching Lee Gwak terrifying.

The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end, and goosebumps rose on her arms.

If even she—one of the top martial experts in Martial Sword Troupe—felt that way, the others must have been even more terrified.

Swallowing her fear, Sa Yeon-hee offered Lee Gwak a respectful martial salute.

“Master Lee!”

“Step aside.”

“I understand how great your anger must be. I know why you’re angry, and I know the extent of Martial Sword Troupe’s wrongdoing.”

“Then step aside.”

“Please allow me to handle this. The reason Hae So-wol, our founder, left behind her sword insights and teachings was specifically so that Martial Sword Troupe’s supreme leader could be corrected if they chose the wrong path.”

“ … ”

“I felt the same as you. I wanted to solve it through dialogue and find a compromise to resolve the issues. That’s why I stood by even though our leader chose the wrong path, believing there was still time to resolve it. I didn’t know it would be this tragic.”

Sa Yeon-hee’s expression was sad.

It wasn’t easy for her to make such a decision.

She might be accused of being a traitor by the warriors of Martial Sword Troupe. Still, she decided to take the thorny path.

“I will resolve the matters of Martial Sword Troupe. Please, master Lee, eliminate the root cause of this situation.”

Moved by Sa Yeon-hee’s words, Lee Gwak turned to look at Yong Cheon-myeong.

Yong Cheon-myeong was looking down at Lee Gwak with his arms crossed.

His expression was still arrogant and unruffled, but Lee Gwak could sense his restlessness.

Lee Gwak nodded and walked past Sa Yeon-hee.

Sa Yeon-hee bowed deeply, showing the utmost respect a warrior could offer.

“A true hero does not need to flaunt himself, the world will recognise him. Only the weak rely on violence and intimidation to solve everything.”

Sa Yeon-hee’s eyes turned to Woo Mun-pae.

It was clear to everyone that her last words were directed at him.

Woo Mun Pae’s face twisted in anger.

“How dare you rebel against our master?”

“It’s not rebellion. It’s about correcting what is wrong.”

“Sa Yeon-hee!”

“I should have done this long ago.”

There was a deep note of regret in her voice.

Thanks to Yu Mun-sang, the Martial Sword Troupe was enjoying its golden age.

Using the wealth accumulated from the Nine Shadows Fleet, the Martial Sword Troupe had expanded its influence across the entire Southern Jianghu.

It had risen to the ranks of a true hegemon. Yet, unsatisfied, they had now joined hands with the Changtian Alliance.

If the Jianghu learned of this, the Martial Sword Troupe would face severe condemnation. It was a shameful act, something that should never have been done.

The first Alliance Leader, Hai Xiaoyue, would be lamenting in the afterlife.

Sa Yeon-hee’s eyes were as cold as ice as she looked at Woo Mun-pae.

She drew her sword with its scabbard and shouted.

“By the authority of the Sea King Sword, I command. From this moment on, all warriors of the Martial Sword Troupe are to withdraw from the battlefield. Anyone who disobeys will be considered a traitor to the Martial Sword Troupe and will be executed.

Kuuu!

Her roar kicked up dust on the field.

The sword in Sa Yeon-hee’s hand was just an ordinary iron sword, but if it was the sword used by the first leader, Hae So Wol, the story changed.

The sword was called the Sea King Sword.

At least, the warriors of Martial Sword Troupe could not ignore or refuse the authority of the Sea King Sword.

“Ugh!”

“Traitor?”

The martial artists of the Martial Sword Troupe looked at each other.

To defy Sa Yeon-hee’s order now meant expulsion from the Martial Sword Troupe.

At that moment, Woo Mun Pae shouted:

“What are you doing? There’s no need to be intimidated by a mere piece of metal.”

He dismissed Sa Yeon-hee’s sword as nothing more than a scrap of iron, completely denying the authority of the Sea King.

A cold light flashed in Sa Yeon-hee’s eyes.

“The young master of the Martial Sword Troupe dares to deny the authority of the leader?”

Others might do such a thing, but someone of his position could not.

At least the head of an organization should uphold the laws and commands. Now, Woo Mun-pae was essentially denying the laws and authority of the Martial Sword Troupe.

Sa Yeon-hee could not forgive Woo Mun-pae.

Swoosh!

She drew her sword.

The icy blade glinted in the sunlight.

As she drew the sword, Sa Yeon-hee’s aura changed.

It was as if the first leader had returned to life, a powerful presence dominating the area.

“Kuek!”

Woo Mun-pae let out a groan without realizing it.

This was because Sa Yeon-hee’s aura had exceeded his expectations.

She had rarely shown her martial prowess before, so he thought she was lucky to have a higher rank than him, but not much else.

But now that she had revealed her true form, her aura surpassed his imagination.

“Kneel.”

“Nonsense!”

Woo Mun Pae shouted as he charged at Sa Yeon Hee.

He had no place left to retreat.

The only way for him to survive was to overpower Sa Yeon Hee.

Sa Yeon Hee slightly shook her head.

“Foolish…”


---


He felt a terrifying surge of qi roil behind him.

It was Sa Yeon Hee and Woo Mun Pae colliding in battle.

Lee Gwak no longer paid attention to them. His gaze was fixed on Yong Cheon Myeong.

The scar on Yong Cheon Myeong’s cheek twitched.

It was a scar left by Lee Gwak many years ago.

For Yong Cheon Myeong, it was a mark of humiliation.

For nine years, he had repeatedly touched the scar, reliving the memory of that day.

The defeat had plunged him into despair, but it had also become the springboard for his resurrection.

Now, Yong Cheon Myeong’s martial prowess has grown exponentially compared to before.

He was confident enough to win against any supreme master, but his body hesitated to move due to the memory of that day.

The stigma of defeat was imprinted on his body.

Crack!

Yong Cheon Myeong bit his lip.

He felt the pain as his flesh tore.

Only then did his body begin to move.

Though he hadn’t completely shaken off the feeling of defeat, he had managed to suppress it to some extent.

“Lee Gwak! You’re always the problem.”

Wherever the progress of the Jade Heaven Alliance was halted, Lee Gwak was always there. This made the contrast even more striking.

Yong Cheon Myeong, who moved with the backing of the Jade Heaven Alliance, and Lee Gwak, who resisted them alone.

As long as Lee Gwak remained here, the comparison between the two would haunt Yong Cheon Myeong until the day he died.

Lee Gwak’s steps were unwavering.

Invincible.

Even if tens of thousands of men stood in his way, there was no match for him.

The martial prowess Lee Gwak had displayed was nothing short of shocking.

If this continues, I will be devoured by him.

Even at this moment, Lee Gwak’s aura was swelling like an avalanche, threatening to devour the entire battlefield.

Yong Cheon Myeong knew he had to break Lee Gwak’s momentum first.

He opened his mouth.

“Soul Forgotten Demons!”

The Soul Forgotten Demons, who had been relentlessly pursuing the Ten Blood Demons, suddenly stopped and turned to look at Yong Cheon Myeong.

“Attack him.”

“……”

The Soul Forgotten Demons didn’t respond. Instead, they showed their answer through action.

Whoosh!

They lunged toward Lee Gwak.

There was not a hint of hesitation in their movements.

“Watch out!”

“They are dangerous!”

The Ten Blood Demons, who had directly faced the Soul Forgotten Demons, exclaimed in warning.

The Soul Forgotten Demons feared no injury. Even if their limbs were severed, they showed no sign of pain and charged forward like vengeful spirits.

TheTen Blood Demons were seasoned veterans who had seen their fair share of battles, but they had never faced opponents like the Soul Forgotten Demons.

One or two wouldn’t have been a problem, but their numbers were overwhelming, and theTen Blood Demons struggled to deal with them all at once. That’s why they understood the terror of the Soul Forgotten Demons better than anyone.

The Soul Forgotten Demons rushed at Lee Gwak without regard for their own lives.

“Huu…”

Lee Gwak let out a sigh.

As he looked at the Soul Forgotten Demons charging toward him, there was pity in his eyes.

“Forgive me.”

When the Soul Forgotten Demons were within arm’s reach, Lee Gwak threw the pillar he had been carrying on his shoulder into the air.

The pillar, which had soared high into the sky, spun rapidly before plunging back down toward the ground.

At that moment, Lee Gwak moved.

His palm spread out like a blooming lotus flower.

Lee Gwak struck the center of the pillar as it fell.

Boom!

In an instant, the pillar exploded, sending the weapons embedded in it flying in all directions.

The Soul Forgotten Demons, who had been charging at Lee Gwak, were caught in the explosion.

They were too close to avoid it.

The aftermath of the explosion was terrifying.

Swords and blades that had been embedded in the pillar pierced through their bodies.

Some had their internal organs exposed, while others lost their heads.

With a single move, Lee Gwak had rendered most of the Soul Forgotten Demons incapable of fighting.

A few who were lucky enough to survive tried to get up, but it was futile.

Lee Gwak’s strike had destroyed not only their flesh but the very nerves that controlled their limbs.

“Ugh!”

The Ten Blood Demons, who had struggled against the Soul Forgotten Demons, were stunned by Lee Gwak’s martial prowess.

Among them, Go Il-cheok, the First Demon, was the most stunned.

“Impossible!”

Although Go Il-cheok had killed many Soul Forgotten Demons, killing as many as Lee Gwak in a single move was beyond his imagination.

Lee Gwak was known in the Jianghu for his bladesmanship. But what he had just displayed was closer to palm techniques.

“They say that once your martial skill reaches its peak, all techniques become one. But isn’t this too much? That young man can’t be more than thirty. I’ve spent eighty years honing my martial arts, yet the gap between us is so wide.”

It felt as if his entire life had been invalidated.

Overwhelmed by a sense of self-loathing, Go Il-cheok bit his lip and stared at Lee Gwak.

But Lee Gwak, for some reason, did not move as he looked down at the corpses of the Soul Forgotten Demons.

The white cloth that tightly wrapped the face of the Soul Forgotten Demons had come loose, revealing his face.

He was a young man around the same age as Lee Gwak.

“Yu… Gajin.”

Lee Gwak recognized him.

He was once a prodigy who trained at the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall on Mount Sohua. He was also acquainted with his wife, Han So-cheon.

Lee Gwak had thought that Yu Ga-jin had left Mount Sohua after being eliminated in the competition.

But it wasn’t just Yu Ga-jin.

All the Soul Forgotten Demons were those who had been eliminated from the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall.

The Jade Heaven Alliance had turned them into Soul Forgotten Demons and used them as pawns.

They had strengthened their bodies with special drugs and stripped them of their sanity to control them.

It was an act that deserved the wrath of heaven.

Lee Gwak raised his head and looked at Yong Cheon-myeong.

Someone had to take responsibility for this.

In Lee Gwak’s mind, Yong Cheon-myeong was one of the main culprits.

“Lee Gwak!”

Yong Cheon-myeong glared back, veins bulging in his furious eyes.

Lee Gwak offered no reply.

He merely drew his blade.

Then he charged straight at Yong Cheon-myeong.
