Lee Gwak opened the door and stepped out.

“Ah, Brother! Are you feeling better now?”

Lim Ji-mun greeted him with a bright face.

Lee Gwak nodded and approached him.

“How much time has passed?”

“It’s already been three days since you entered seclusion to recover.”

“You mean I’ve been recovering for that long?”

“Yes! I still can’t believe you suffered internal injuries severe enough to require three days of deep cultivation. Was Dan Li-yeon’s martial arts always that formidable?”

At Lim Ji-mun’s words, Lee Gwak’s gaze darkened.

“Whatever happened, it seems she’s not only recovered her martial arts but also made significant progress.”

“Is this what it means to be part of the Jade Heaven Alliance? How did they manage to revive Dan Li-yeon’s martial arts when she was practically crippled?”

“……”

Lee Gwak couldn’t answer easily.

Even though it had been a surprise attack, Dan Li-yeon’s strike had left him with serious internal injuries.

Considering Dan Li-yeon’s original capabilities, this should have been impossible. She had recklessly drawn upon her innate qi, leaving her nearly crippled. But, in just a few months, she had not only recovered but surpassed her previous strength—something that defied common sense.

What troubled Lee Gwak the most was the nature of Dan Li-yeon’s internal energy that had invaded his body.

It was a sinister, destructive force unlike anything he had ever encountered before.

It was completely different from the internal energy she had used when they fought in the past.

Typically, once a martial artist mastered an internal energy technique, its nature remained unchanged for life—unless they completely abandoned their previous method and trained in an entirely new one.

But switching to a completely different internal energy technique was no easy feat.

A martial artist’s body was optimally adapted to the technique they had trained in since childhood. Their meridians, nerves, muscles, eyes, and ears—everything developed in alignment with their original technique. Learning a new method required a massive physical adjustment.

This process was far from simple and certainly couldn’t be completed in just a few months.

For orthodox sects, it was outright impossible.

‘Did she learn demonic or evil arts?’

Lee Gwak let out a quiet sigh.

Even though the Jade Heaven Alliance was criticized for its conquest in the name of unifying the Jianghu, it was still nominally a righteous sect. The idea that they allowed someone to learn such forbidden arts within their ranks was hard to accept. The idea that they would allow Dan Li-yeon to practice forbidden techniques was hard to comprehend.

There was only one person in the Jade Heaven Alliance who could have intervened in Dan Li-yeon’s training.

‘Ja Hong-cheon!’

The moment Lee Gwak thought of him, he felt a chill run down his spine.

At the root of all this chaos was Ja Hong-cheon.

As long as he remained, incidents like this would continue to happen.

Just then—

“Are you feeling better now?”

A clear voice snapped Lee Gwak out of his thoughts.

When he looked up, he saw Mok Seon-wol walking toward him.

“Miss Mok!”

Lee Gwak raised his hands in a respectful greeting. Mok Seon-wol returned the gesture with a slight bow.

“How are your injuries?”

“Thanks to you, I’ve fully recovered.”

“That’s a relief.”

“Where are we right now?”

Lee Gwak glanced around as he spoke.

They were currently on a boat. The surrounding scenery was nothing but rivers and mountains, making it impossible to pinpoint their exact location.

“We’re near Xiangyang, a few hundred li from Wudang Sect.”

“We haven’t traveled as far as I thought.”

“As you can see, this isn’t a fast boat, so we’re moving slowly. Still, for a group this size, there’s no better way to travel.”

Thanks to that, Lee Gwak had been able to focus solely on his recovery without worrying about external threats.

Mok Seon-wol gazed at the flowing river and murmured,

“I never imagined Li-yeon would change so much.”

She and Dan Li-yeon had been close since childhood.

Mok Seon-wol considered Dan Li-yeon her only true friend, and Dan Li-yeon felt the same. That’s why Mok Seon-wol believed she knew Dan Li-yeon better than anyone.

But the Dan Li-yeon she had seen at Sipyeon was completely unfamiliar. Mok Seon-wol had never once seen her so consumed by bloodlust.

She even began to doubt whether that woman was truly the Dan Li-yeon she knew.

Lee Gwak cautiously shared his thoughts.

“It seems she resorted to extreme measures to recover her martial arts.”

“Extreme measures?”

“I suspect she may have practiced forbidden techniques.”

“I think the same. There’s no way her martial arts could have advanced so rapidly through normal means.”

“If she truly did practice forbidden arts, her personality would have changed as well.”

The terrifying aspect of demonic and evil techniques is that they rely on shortcuts to achieve rapid progress. While these techniques granted abnormally fast growth, they also came with severe costs.

They could destroy one’s nature or drive the practitioner into madness.

Lee Gwak had already seen the vicious killing intent and madness in Dan Li-yeon’s eyes. That’s why he was certain she had embraced forbidden techniques.

“Haa… how did it come to this…”

Mok Seon-wol sighed.

She could accept ideological conflict between sects.

That’s why she had never once blamed Dan Li-yeon for supporting the enemy, the Jade Heaven Alliance.

But if Dan Li-yeon had truly been corrupted by those forbidden techniques and now regarded her as an enemy, Mok Seon-wol had no idea how she would respond.

“It must be because of the Alliance Leader, right?”

“Most likely.”

“I just don’t understand what he’s thinking. How could he use his disciple like that…?”

Muk Seon-wol bit her lip.

Though she maintained a calm expression, deep anger was raging in her heart.

If she could, she would storm into the Jade Heaven Alliance right now, seize Ja Hong-cheon by the collar, and demand he restore her friend to normal.

Clench!

Veins bulged on her small, tightly clenched fists.

Dan Li-yeon stared blankly at her hand.

Her snow-white hand still reeked of blood. No matter how thoroughly she washed it, the scent clung to her skin.

She shook her hand, but the stench didn’t leave—it lingered around her like a curse.

At that moment, a middle-aged martial artist walking behind her spoke.

“We’ve arrived at the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

Dan Ri-yeon lifted her gaze to see the massive fortress ahead.

The Jade Heaven Alliance was ready to receive her.

To her, this place was like home. Having spent nearly her entire life here, she couldn’t even imagine moving elsewhere. But as she gazed at the alliance, what filled her eyes was not nostalgia, but unmistakable hatred.

“Are you alright, Young Mistress?”

A scholar nearby addressed her.

It was Joo Shin-yoon, the Alliance’s inner court leader.

Dan Li-yeon nodded slightly.

“I’m fine.”

“Thank you. You saved my life.”

Joo Shin-yoon finally offered his gratitude.

Dan Li-yeon quietly shook her head.

It was Joo Shin-yoon, the Alliance’s internal affairs leader.

Dan Li-yeon nodded slightly.

“I’m fine.”

“Thank you. You saved my life.”

Joo Shin-yoon finally offered his gratitude.

Dan Li-yeon quietly shook her head.

“I was just following the Alliance Leader’s orders. There’s no need to thank me.”

“Regardless, I won’t forget this kindness.”

“I’m tired. I’ll go rest now.”

“Of course.”

Dan Li-yeon returned to her quarters as soon as she entered the alliance.

Though it had been a long time since she last visited, nothing in her residence had changed, her maids had maintained everything in her absence.

This was the only place in the Jade Heaven Alliance where she could truly relax.

“Haah…”

The moment she sat on her bed, Dan Li-yeon let out a sigh.

Memories of Sipyeon resurfaced.

The expressions of Lee Gwak and Mok Seon-wol, staring at her as if she were some kind of monster, remained vivid in her mind.

“Don’t look at me like that. I had no choice.”

Dan Li-yeon gritted her teeth.

A crimson madness flickered in her eyes.

Suddenly, the flowers in a nearby vase withered instantly.

“Ah! L-Lady!”

The startled cry came from her maid outside the door.

Dan Li-yeon quickly regained control of herself and withdrew her energy.

When she opened the door, her maid was lying on the floor, breathing heavily. Foam had formed at her lips, and her eyes were unfocused.

A little longer under Dan Li-yeon’s killing intent, and she would have died.

Dan Li-yeon spoke to her calmly.

“Go back to your quarters.”

“B-but I must serve—”

“No need. I wish to be alone today. Make sure no one comes near.”

“Yes, lady…”

The maid left, her legs still trembling from the aftershock of Dan Li-yeon’s presence.

Dan Li-yeon watched her go with a blank expression.

They had been together a long time. They weren’t like sisters, but at least close enough to share kind words.

But now, she felt nothing toward the girl.

So this is what it’s like…

Ja Hong-cheon had warned her.

Once she mastered it all, she wouldn’t feel the same.

She might even regret it.

But Dan Li Yeon had made the choice herself.

And she didn’t regret it. If she hadn’t chosen this path, she would have become a cripple and fallen into ruin.

I’ll never go back to that time.

She clenched her teeth.

Even the brief memory of losing her martial arts haunted her.

For someone who had lived as a martial artist all her life, losing her skills was worse than death.

She locked the door and sat in cultivation.

White Lotus Crimson Heaven Art

That was the name of the technique Ja Hong-cheon had passed on to her.

To master it quickly, Dan Li-yeon had to endure the hellish training Ja Hong-cheon had prepared.

The training hall he arranged was so hellish that no sane person would willingly endure it.

Had Dan Li-yeon not lost her martial arts, she would never have stepped foot in that place.

“Ugh…”

Just remembering the place made her groan in pain.

Dan Li-yeon immediately began circulating the White Lotus Red Heaven Art.

If she didn’t use it whenever the pain resurfaced, she would lose her sanity. And once that happened, she had no idea what she might do.

Whoosh!

As soon as she activated the technique, a hazy white mist enveloped her.

With each breath she took, the mist writhed like a living creature.

Her flowing black hair fluttered along with the mist.

As her cultivation reached its peak, the mist began to seep into her hair.

And as it did, her hair gradually turned white.

Sigh…

When she finally finished, half of her once-black hair had turned snow-white.

“What…?”

Seeing her reflection in the mirror, Dan Li-yeon’s expression darkened in irritation.

Her precious hair had turned white overnight.

But her reaction ended there.

Even though she had once treasured her hair like her life, all she felt now was mild annoyance.

Dan Li-yeon changed her clothes without another thought.

Just then, a guard’s voice came from outside.

“The alliance Leader summons you, Young Mistress.”

“Master?”

“Yes! He requests your presence at his residence immediately.”

“Understood. I’ll go now.”

Before leaving, Dan Li-yeon instinctively reached for her black veil. But seeing how poorly it matched her now white hair, she left it behind and headed to Ja Hong-cheon’s quarters.

“Master!”

“You’re here.”

A strange light flickered in Ja Hong-cheon’s eyes as he looked at Dan Li-yeon.

He had noticed that half of her hair had turned white.

A faint, sinister smile curled at his lips.

“Excellent. The mastery of the White Lotus Red Heaven Art is now within reach. Once you achieve it, your hair will turn completely white. At that moment, you will become a completely different person.”

There was a vast difference between the mastered and unmastered versions of the White Lotus Red Heaven Art. A perfected White Lotus Red Heaven Art was something even Ja Hong Cheon couldn’t confidently face in battle.

“At this level, I can trust you with this mission.”

“What mission is that?”

“One that will change the course of the Jianghu.”

“Change the course…?”

“It’s something only you can do. With the White Lotus Red Heaven Art on the verge of mastery, you are more than capable of accomplishing it.”

Ja Hong Cheon’s gaze shone with a chilling light, more terrifying than ever before.

In the past, she would have been afraid. But at this moment, Dan Liyan felt nothing.

Her eyes had become strikingly similar to Ja Hong-cheon’s, but she remained unaware of it.

Ja Hong-cheon asked:

“Can you do it?”

“Yes!”

Dan Li-yeon answered without even knowing the details.
