Go Jeon-ok asked,

“What is it?”

“I’m sorry, Lord Go.”

The martial artist from Heavenly Intelligence Hall bowed his head to the ground.

Go Jeon-ok’s expression turned cold.

“I asked what happened.”

“We encountered a suspicious individual while gathering information, and then…”

“And then?”

“We didn’t even have a chance to defend ourselves and were defeated. Please kill me.”

Thud!

The martial artist slammed his head on the ground again. Blood dripped from his forehead, but he didn’t lift his head.

Go Jeon-ok’s eyes narrowed.

The martial artists he had brought were renowned in the Heavenly Intelligence Hall for their martial prowess. They weren’t weak enough to return after losing a fight. If they couldn’t even put up a fight, it meant their opponent was extremely strong.

“Did you figure out who he was?”

“I’m sorry.”

“You don’t even know which sect he is from?”

“No! There was nothing distinctive about him. He seemed like a wandering martial artist… Ah! There was one strange thing.”

“What was that?”

“He immediately recognised that we were from the Heavenly Intelligence Hall.

At the martial artist’s words, Go Jeon-ok frowned.

Given Heavenly Intelligence Hall’s secretive nature in handling information, its members are rarely exposed to outsiders. Unless one is an insider, it’s nearly impossible to know someone’s affiliation with the Heavenly Intelligence Hall

“Are you sure he recognized you right away?”

“Yes. As soon as he saw us, he was certain we were from the Heavenly Intelligence Hall. And he seemed to know you as well.”

“He knows me?”

Go Jeon-ok’s expression grew serious.

It’s one thing to know about the Heavenly Intelligence Hall, but if that person knew about him, then it was clear the person was deeply familiar with the workings of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

“Describe his appearance. What did he look like?”

“He was rather tall. His facial features were gentle, but…”

The martial artist described in detail the appearance of the man he had seen. As his explanation continued, Go Jeon-ok’s expression became increasingly rigid.

The martial artist’s description astonishingly resembled someone he knew.

“Could it be… Lee Gwak?”

His fist clenched involuntarily.

The martial artist’s description alone wasn’t enough to confirm that the person was Lee Gwak, but his instincts told him it was.

‘Has Lee Gwak really returned?’

The veins on his tightly clenched fist stood out.

Just thinking of the name Lee Gwak made his body tense up.

“Mobilize all of the Heavenly Intelligence Hall immediately and find him.”

“Sir?”

“You must find him. Do you understand?”

“Yes! Understood.”

The martial artist answered and withdrew.

Left alone, Go Jeon-ok’s face twisted like that of a demon.

“Lee Gwak! If you stand in my way, I won’t let you go, no matter who you are.”

Yoo Gang-ui led Lee Gwak to a slum on the outskirts of Chaohu.

The streets were littered with filth and the stench was overwhelming. Only the poor who lived there dared to enter.

Yoo Gang-ui led Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong to the shabbiest house in the slum.

When he knocked, an old woman without a single tooth peeked out.

“Branch Leader?”

“I’ve brought important guests; please open the door.”

“Yes!”

The old woman hurriedly opened the door.

Yoo Gang-ui led Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong inside.

In the deepest room of the house, someone lay under a blanket.

“Brother!”

Lee Gwak rushed over to check.

The person lying there, lean as bamboo and with a pale, bloodless face, was unmistakably Ki Jin-hwi.

Despite Lee Gwak calling out, Ki Jin-hwi did not wake. Lee Gwak quickly pulled back the blanket and examined his entire body.

Though Ki Jin-hwi had many small wounds across his body, none were life-threatening.

With such minor injuries, he should have woken when Lee Gwak called out to him. Yet, Ki Jin-hwi showed no signs of waking.

“Brother…!”

“Uncle!”

Lee Cheong also rushed over to Ki Jin-hwi’s side.

During their time at Mount Yeosan, Ki Jin-hwi had been particularly fond of Lee Cheong. They had built many memories in a short time.

Tears welled up in Lee Cheong’s eyes.

He shook Ki Jin-hwi, saying,

“Please wake up, Uncle! Cheong is here.”

But Ki Jin-hwi didn’t move, as if he were a stone statue.

Yoo Gang-ui sat next to Lee Gwak and said,

“He’s been like this ever since he returned injured.”

“Do you know who wounded him?”

“I don’t know. That day, he suddenly showed up injured and asked us to inform the main headquarters about him. He said they’d know what to do…”

Lee Gwak’s eyebrows twitched.

Ki Jin-hwi knew about the relationship between Lee Gwak and Nam Woo-gyeong. Therefore, he must have anticipated that news of him would reach Lee Gwak.

In other words, Ki Jin-hwi had summoned him.

“Brother!”

Lee Gwak grabbed Ki Jin-hwi’s pulse and infused his internal energy.

Ki Jin-hwi’s insides were hollow, like an empty box. Usually, when foreign internal energy enters, there’s resistance, but there was none.

It was as if his internal energy had vanished. But Lee Gwak knew that couldn’t be.

His dantian was intact.

Internal energy might temporarily wane but couldn’t completely disappear.

This meant Ki Jin-hwi’s internal energy was gathered somewhere other than his dantian.

Lee Gwak carefully explored inside Ki Jin-hwi’s body.

Like a snake released from a net, his qi searched every corner of Ki Jin-hwi’s meridians.

“Hmm?”

The qi, which had been roaming freely, was blocked at the neck area. The Wind Gate, Mute Gate, and Great Vertebra points connecting the neck to the head were hardened like stones.

This was not normal.

Lee Gwak adjusted his energy and carefully stimulated the three blocked points. In response, he felt a strong, unfamiliar resistance.

The qi felt both subtle and foreign.

The internal energy of Ki Jin-hwi that Lee Gwak knew was not like this. An external qi was occupying his main acupoints.

Lee Gwak stimulated the three points again, and the foreign qi resisted even more strongly.

If the Wind Gate, Mute Gate, and Great Vertebra points hadn’t hardened, the foreign qi would have burrowed into Ki Jin-hwi’s head, attacking the Brain Gate, Posterior Gate, and Baihui points.

Had those points been attacked, Ki Jin-hwi would have lost his mind or gone insane.

Ki Jin-hwi, invaded by the foreign qi, had surely closed off his acupoints to protect his mind.

‘I must expel the foreign qi.’

Lee Gwak released Ki Jin-hwi’s wrist and opened his eyes. Lee Cheong immediately asked,

“Is Uncle okay?”

“I need to expel the foreign qi that’s occupying his body. Stand guard for me.”

“Don’t worry.”

With a determined expression, Lee Cheong nodded.

Lee Gwak crossed his legs, grabbed K0i Jin-hwi’s wrist again, and channeled his qi into attacking the foreign qi within.

Yu Gang-ui watched the scene with concern.

“Is this really okay? Expelling foreign qi from someone else’s body isn’t an easy task. If something goes wrong, it could even damage his vital meridians and kill him.”

“It’ll be fine.”

Lee Cheong’s face was full of confidence as he answered.

He believed in Lee Gwak, not just because he was his father, but because he trusted in his abilities.

Seeing the unwavering determination in Lee Cheong’s eyes, Yu Gang-ui swallowed his doubts.

‘Could he really pull it off?’

He glanced at Lee Gwak with uncertainty.

He had heard of Lee Gwak’s reputation.

There was a time when Lee Gwak’s name alone terrified the world. Toppling the White Light Sect alone wasn’t something anyone could do.

His martial prowess was truly outstanding. It was unknown how much stronger he’d become in the three years since. But personal strength and managing another’s qi were completely different matters.

In order to achieve the desired result by injecting internal qi into someone else’s body, it required unimaginably delicate manipulation and immense internal energy.

Yoo Gang-ui wondered if Lee Gwak truly possessed that level of ability.

Meanwhile, Lee Gwak used the Eight Snakes Art to attack the foreign qi occupying the acupuncture points in Ki Jin-hwi’s neck.

Naturally, the foreign qi resisted, rampaging wildly. If left unchecked, it would destroy the main meridians.

Lee Gwak delicately manipulated his internal energy to envelop the foreign qi. But the foreign qi didn’t succumb easily, slipping away here and there.

He concentrated his mind.

Slowly, but without pause, he operated his internal energy with patience, eventually capturing all the foreign qi.

It was then.

Ki Jin-hwi’s internal energy, which had been suppressed, started to flow again.

Just as Lee Gwak had anticipated, Ki Jin-hwi had pushed his remaining energy into his brain to protect it.

Ki Jin-hwi’s internal energy aided Lee Gwak’s in attacking the foreign qi.

The foreign qi made one last violent attempt, but it couldn’t harm Ki Jin-hwi due to the protective influence of the Eight Snakes Art.

In the end, the foreign qi dissipated within Ki Jin-hwi’s body.

Ki Jin-hwi’s internal energy headed toward his dantian, which was dried up like parched earth. His dantian had no internal energy left. But when stimulated by the energy released from his head, it sprouted and began to grow.

Only then did Lee Gwak remove his hand from Ki Jin-hwi.

He silently watched Ki Jin-hwi’s condition.

Color gradually returned to Ki Jin-hwi’s once pale face.

After a moment, Ki Jin-hwi’s eyebrows twitched, and he cautiously opened his eyes.

It took a little time for focus to return to his eyes.

Lee Cheong, who had been watching with bated breath, urgently asked,

“Uncle, are you okay?”

“Who? Cheong?”

“Yes! It’s me.”

“It’s really you. I thought I was hearing things.”

Ki Jin-hwi turned his head to look at Lee Cheong.

“I’m glad…”

Lee Cheong threw himself into Ki Jin-hwi’s arms, causing Gi Jin-hwi to wince.

“Ow! That hurts, you rascal!”

“Oh! Sorry!”

Lee Cheong quickly jumped back, startled.

A small smile played on Ki Jin-hwi’s lips. He was certainly fun to tease.

Ki Jin-hwi’s gaze then shifted to Lee Gwak.

“As expected of you, Leader.”

“How are you feeling?”

“How could I be okay? My body is completely wrecked.”

“Who did this to you?”

“Gyeong Chu-wol.”

“Who is that?”

“The one who stole our family’s secret technique.”

“The traitor you mentioned before?”

“Yes!”

Ki Jin-hwi nodded and tried to sit up, but his limbs lacked strength, and he could only flail weakly.

Seeing this, Lee Gwak carefully lifted Gi Jin-hwi and helped him sit against the wall.

Ki Jin-hwi then turned to Lee Cheong.

“I’m thirsty. Could you bring me some water?”

“Yes! Just wait a moment.”

Lee Cheong quickly ran outside.

This time, ki Jin-hwi looked at Yoo Gang-ui. Sensing his intention, Yoo Gang-ui quietly left the room.

Once they were alone, Ki Jin-hwi continued,

“If he hadn’t ambushed me, I wouldn’t have been defeated so helplessly. I never thought he’d use the Dark Moon Pavilion to distract me. Do you know that the master of the Dark Moon Pavilion is Go Jeon-ok?”

“I know.”

“Sigh! I never imagined those two would join forces.”

Ki Jin-hwi let out a deep sigh.

Gyeong Chu-wol had reached an incredible level in the time they hadn’t seen each other. The technique he had used, 100 days’ cursed dream, was completely unexpected.

Anyone hit by that technique would spend a hundred days in a dream-like state, unable to move, practically living as a corpse.

Even with tight defenses, it’s hard to block the ‘100 days’ cursed dream. The technique was so powerful that even Ki Jin-hwi had not yet mastered it.

Yet, Gyeong Chu-wol had wielded it with ease.

At that level, even without the ambush, he couldn’t have guaranteed victory against Gyeong Chu-wol.

The moment he was hit by the ‘100 days’ cursed dream, He escaped the battlefield and came straight to the Hao Clan. He made sure the message would reach Lee Gwak, then concentrated all of his remaining qi to resist the technique.

If he hadn’t, even if he had woken up, his brain would have been severely damaged.

“If it weren’t for you, I would have been bedridden for a hundred days before losing my life.”

“How’s your body now?”

“Fortunately, I protected my head with my internal energy, so I’m fine. A day or two of rest, and I should recover.”

“That’s a relief.”

“Thank you. I survived thanks to you, Squad Leader. I will never forget this kindness.”

“Not at all.”

Lee Gwak gently shook his head.

When Han So-cheon was in danger, Gi Jin-hwi had helped her escape without hesitation. If not for him, he wouldn’t have been able to spend the past three years happily at Mount Quilian.

Compared to that, this was really nothing.

That’s what Lee Gwak thought.
