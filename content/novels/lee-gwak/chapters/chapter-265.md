“Did you sleep well?”

After breakfast, the first thing Lee Cheong did was check on the horses. The horse wagged its tail gently, perhaps recognizing its owner.

Lee Cheong entered the stable and carefully inspected the horses. Fortunately, both were in good condition.

With a pleased smile, he placed the saddles on the horses.

He quickly finished a task that even adults found challenging.

Just as he finished, Lee Gwak appeared, carrying a bundle. Inside were rice balls wrapped neatly in lotus leaves, bought from the inn.

As he loaded the bundle onto the back of the saddle, Lee Gwak said, “Let’s go.”

“Yes!”

Without any assistance from Lee Gwak, Lee Cheong swiftly mounted the large horse. Lee Gwak also mounted his horse and came outside.

Outside the stable, the Sanghyeon Escort Agency was already ready to depart.

Lee Cheong approached the large carriage. As he did, the window opened, and Ban Seol-hwa revealed her face.

Lee Cheong greeted her,

“Hello!”

“Hi!” Ban Seol-hwa nodded shyly.

“Take care of me during our journey.”

“I should say the same…”

Ban Seol-hwa had already heard from Ban Wu-yeom that Lee Cheong would be joining them. From the moment she learned this, she had been feeling as though she was floating on air.

After greeting Ban Seol-hwa, Lee Cheong returned to Lee Gwak’s side. Just then, Ban Wu-yeom gave orders to the escort team.

“Let’s depart.”

“Yes, sir!”

A group of about twenty people began moving.

For this journey, the Sanghyeon Escort Agency had chosen not to bring any porters for menial tasks. The long-distance journey was so strenuous that only guards trained in martial arts had been selected. Because of this, the escorts had to handle even the minor tasks themselves, but none of them complained.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong followed at the very rear of the group.

Usually, when there were carts or carriages carrying loads, the speed was bound to be slow. But the Sanghyeon Escort Agency defied such common sense and moved at a very fast pace.

They solved lunch on horseback with pre-prepared jerky or dry rations, and for dinner, they tried to settle at an inn as much as possible.

When unavoidable, they camped outdoors, but since they were people with a lot of experience, they quickly finished preparations even without Lee Gwak’s help.

Thanks to that, Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong could comfortably reach Hapyang.

During the three days to Hapyang, Lee Cheong and Ban Seolhwa grew closer, and Lee Gwak also formed friendships with the agency’s escorts.

Upon arriving at Hapyang, a fairly large ship was waiting for the Sanghyeon Escort Agency.

“Phew! We can finally relax a little,” Ban Wu-yeom sighed in relief.

Escort missions always carried a sense of tension. Transporting valuable goods was particularly stressful, requiring constant vigilance.At least during the time they were on the ship, they could be relatively safe from external threats, so his burden lessened

“Quickly board the ship. There’s space below deck for the horses, so tie them up there.”

Since they had become quite friendly during the journey, Ban Wu-yeom spoke comfortably to Lee Gwak.

“Understood.”

“I’ll go up to the deck and rest. Now that I’m old, every joint aches. If I want to keep doing this job until Seol-hwa grows up, I need to take care of my body.”

“You seem quite healthy to me.”

“I may look fine on the outside, but there’s no place that doesn’t hurt inside. Well, I should be thankful that I can still move on my own two feet.”

Lee Gwak smiled slightly at Ban Wu-yeom’s complaint and went on his way.

Perhaps tired from the journey, the horses were lowering their heads and breathing heavily.

“You’ve done well. Rest until we reach land,” Lee Gwak said as he patted the horse’s neck.

Lee Cheong did the same.

“Thank you! You worked hard.”

There was a stable prepared below deck for the horses.

After tying up the horses in the stable, Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong went up to the deck.

The sail, filled with wind, spread wide, and soon they were moving quickly along the river.

Leaning on the railing, Lee Cheong gazed absentmindedly at the scenery.

“So this is the Yangtze.”

Though he had read about it, this was the first time he was seeing it with his own eyes.

The mighty river flowing relentlessly, with the landscape spreading out on either side, left a profound impression on him.

‘I’m glad I decided to come out into the world.’

Lee Cheong glanced up at Lee Gwak, who was staring silently ahead. Though he didn’t know what Lee Gwak was thinking, he understood that most of his thoughts revolved around family.

Quietly, Lee Cheong reached for Lee Gwak’s hand. As Lee Gwak looked down at him with a smile, Ban Wu-yeom and his granddaughter approached.

“You two seem to have a great relationship.”

“You both make a good pair too.”

“Haha! Not as much as you two. We’ll be on this ship for five days, so take this chance to rest well.”

“Aren’t we stopping at any ports?”

“As I said before, we’ve rented the entire ship. Since we won’t be taking on any other passengers, there’s no reason to stop at a port. That’s why it will take five days to reach Jeongju. Otherwise, it would take twice as long.”

“I see.”

Lee Gwak nodded.

“Aren’t you hungry? Let’s leave the kids here and go have a drink. What do you think?”

“That sounds good.”

Lee Gwak and Ban Wu-yeom walked away together.

Meanwhile, leaning against the railing, Lee Cheong and Ban Seol-hwa continued their cheerful conversation. Smiles bloomed on both their faces.

Fortunately, the journey proceeded smoothly.

Thanks to that, Lee Gwak could comfortably sit and watch over Cheong’s martial arts practice.

Except for the time when he went out to the deck to talk with Ban Seol-hwa, Cheong always trained with Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak passed on the Eight Sects Sword Art to Lee Cheong, a style he himself had learned in his youth.

The greatest advantage of the Eight Sects Blade Art was its simplicity. Although it was straightforward, the insight gained by Lee Gwak over the years made it a formidable skill, capable of competing with any martial art in the world.

The technique consisted of eight powerful stances:

Each stance possessed incredible destructive power.

Drawing his blade, Lee Gwak spoke, “The essence of Eight Sects Blade Art Technique lies in points and lines.”

“Points and lines?”

“What do you think is the biggest difference between a sword and a blade?”

“Hmm! A sword has two edges, and a blade has one, so there’s a difference in the application of techniques. For example, a sword’s power is maximized when thrusting rather than slashing, while blades double their power when swung due to their destructive potential.”

“Correct. Because of that, sword techniques mostly form graceful lines. To maximize the utility of the double edges, it’s advantageous that way. But a blade is different. A blade is the most intuitive weapon created by humans for killing.”

Ssshing!

Lee Gwak swung his blade.

It was a simple horizontal slash, yet it gave Lee Cheong a chilling sensation.

“Father?”

“What I just performed was not a special stance. I merely connected two points in the shortest distance to create a line. All the stances in the Eight Sects Blade Art are composed of such simple yet powerful lines. You must understand this.”

“I understand.”

Lee Cheong nodded, his face more serious than ever.

While Lee Gwak was a kind father, he was a strict teacher, especially when it came to martial arts. This made Lee Cheong naturally more focused whenever they trained together.

“Show me what you’ve learned.”

“Yes, sir!”

Following his father’s instruction, Lee Cheong began executing the stances of the Eight Sects Blade Art. His movements were still clumsy as it was his first attempt, but he was serious and fully absorbed in his practice.

Lee Gwak adjusted his stance where needed.

The stances were not particularly difficult, so Lee Cheong quickly became accustomed to them. However, fully executing the Eight Sects Blade Art required immense stamina.

By the time he had finished all eight stances, his body was drenched in sweat.

“Huff! Huff!”

Lee Cheong panted heavily, his lungs and heart feeling like they were about to burst, and the taste of iron filled his mouth. He wanted nothing more than to collapse and rest, but his father’s strict voice interrupted him.

“Do it again.”

“Yes, Father!”

Without time to complain, Lee Cheong resumed practicing the Eight Sects Blade Art.

Swish! Swish!

The blade cut through the air in the narrow cabin.

As he neared the end of his training session, his father’s cold voice rang out once more.

“Again!”

“Yes!”

Despite his exhaustion, with his limbs trembling and feeling like he might vomit, Lee Cheong gritted his teeth and executed the stances once more.

Eventually, his body could no longer handle the strain, and he collapsed in exhaustion.

His eyes had long since lost focus. His mind was blank, and he felt like he might die if he continued. Just then, Lee Gwak began massaging his entire body.

Starting from his feet, he moved up to the shoulders, and from the shoulders to the arms.

Gently, he massaged Lee Cheong with great care.

What Lee Gwak was performing was a technique known as Pushing the Palaces and Passing the Acupoints.

“Father?”

Unaware of what his father was doing, Lee Cheong looked at him with confusion.

“Just stay still.”

With a warm smile, Lee Gwak continued massaging his son’s body. But it wasn’t just a simple massage. He used the qi from his Eight Snakes Art to gently guide and nourish the qi within Lee Cheong’s body. The qi within Lee Cheong naturally responded, and the qi in his father’s hands carefully nurtured and strengthened the budding qi within him.

What Lee Gwak was performing wasn’t just ordinary acupressure. It was an advanced healing technique enhanced by his mastery of the Eight Snakes Art, making it several times more effective.

Although Cheong didn’t understand the full extent of his father’s efforts, he could feel his father’s dedication.

‘Father!’

With that thought, Lee Cheong closed his eyes.

He could feel a warm energy coursing through his body, stimulating every part of him.

While maintaining his focus, Lee Gwak’s expression remained serene as he continued his acupressure.

Forcing Cheong to push himself to the point of exhaustion was the only way to maximize the benefits of this technique.

Even beads of sweat formed on Lee Gwak’s forehead as the technique consumed a great deal of his internal energy.

He worked on his son for nearly half an hour.

The effects of anything are most effective when it’s done for the first time, so Lee Gwak was

even more devoted.

After all, this was his own son.

Naturally, he wanted to achieve the best outcome. So, he continued his acupressure even longer.

As he maintained his focus, the sleeping Lee Cheong lay still.

This was a critical moment. He couldn’t afford to stop.

Just then—

Thud!

A sudden jolt ran through the ship.

Sensing that something was wrong, Lee Gwak furrowed his brow.

The ship was in an uproar.

“Don’t let them board!”

“Send more men to the stern! That side is vulnerable!”

The deck was a chaotic mess.

The escort leader and guards of the Sanghyeon Escort Agency were on guard with their weapons.

Two large ships were blocking their path.

These weren’t ordinary ships like the one they were on; they were fast ships, designed to cut through the water.

The ships had appeared suddenly, cutting off Sanghyeon Escort Agency’s path and launching an attack.

‘Are they pirates?’

Ban Wu-yeom quickly dismissed that thought.

These men were far too disciplined to be mere pirates. Although there were more than forty of them, not a single sound came from their ranks. The silence alone spoke volumes about their training and organization.

No mere pirates could maintain such strict discipline.

These men were elite.

Atop the mast of the enemy ships flew a plain green flag, devoid of any markings.

“Could it be… the Green Heaven Society?”

Ban Wu-yeom’s voice trembled.
