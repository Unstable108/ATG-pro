Swish!

It took him only three swift steps to close a gap of twenty zhangs.

Lee Gwak had plunged himself into the heart of the Ghost Sword Squad.

Sssht!

His blade cleaved the air.

Red stains appeared on the blue sky.

“Ugh!”

“Argh!”

Two martial artists of the Ghost Sword Squad fell from their horses with screams. Deep blade wounds had already been engraved on their chests.

Red blood spurted out like fountains.

They were dead without a doubt.

“What the—?”

“What happened?”

The martial artists of the Ghost Sword Squad shouted in alarm.

They never expected Lee Gwak to suddenly charge in and launch a lethal attack.

‘Ryu-jin!’

He was a pitiful child.

An innocent bird who had lost everything overnight and sought refuge in his arms. Though their acquaintance lasted only a few days, Cho Ryu-jin had made Lee Gwak think about many things.

Because of that, Lee Gwak had felt a special affection for him.

Such a child had died before his eyes.

Without even giving him a chance to do anything.

“Did you have to take everything away like that? Everything from this child…”

Lee Gwak’s low voice echoed eerily across the battlefield.

It was the first time in years that Lee Gwak felt such fury.

He thought he’d finally found peace, after living away from Jianghu for three years.

He’d hoped to live quietly, away from the chaos of the Jianghu.

With his beloved wife and children, forgotten by the world.

But now he understood clearly.

The monster called Jianghu would never let him go.

No matter how hard he resisted, Jianghu would keep dragging him back.

To the swamp of vengeance, to the lake of blood.

No matter how much Lee Gwak rejected the Jianghu, it was useless.

The Jianghu wanted him.

Moving with the wind, Lee Gwak shouted.

“If that’s what you want, I’ll grant your wish.”

“What nonsense? Gah!”

Blood spurted from the neck of another Ghost Sword Squad martial artist in Lee Gwak’s path. His blade had swept past in an instant.

In a matter of moments, more than ten Ghost Sword Squad Martial Artists lay dead.

Lee Gwak’s blade, fueled by his killing intent, showed no mercy.

Shlak!

“Aargh!”

The legendary “One Blade, One Kill” was now unleashed against the Ghost Sword Squad.

Lee Gwak’s sword held no trace of mercy.

The icy blue sky was splattered with droplets of red.

“Ugh!”

“What…what is this?”

The martial artists of the Ghost Sword Squad gasped in horror. They couldn’t hide the terror in their eyes.

They were accustomed to striking fear into others—not feeling it themselves.

They’d taken pleasure in others’ suffering

It was the same when they wiped out the Cho Family Manor.

Their sadism had been cultivated over long years of experience.

But now, they were the ones trembling in terror.

Lee Gwak’s skill was beyond anything they could comprehend.

It wasn’t just his strength.

At this moment, Lee Gwak looked like a demon itself.

Each time his blade slashed through the air, the Ghost Sword martial artists screamed as they fell.

“Damn it! Dismount and respond!”

At last, Ok Mu-yeon, the leader, snapped out of his daze and issued orders. But by then, half of the Ghost Sword Corps had already lost their lives.

It was a nightmare.

The surviving martial artists didn’t want to believe it.

“This can’t be real.”

“Where did this monster come from?”

Lee Gwak no longer looked human to them.

Covered in the blood of their comrades, he seemed something far beyond a mere mortal.

“Attack him together!”

At Ok Mu-yeon’s command, the Ghost Sword Squad attempted a joint attack. But even with their coordinated efforts, it was impossible to stop Lee Gwak’s blade.

Swoosh!

“Ugh!”

Screams echoed continuously.

It was a blood-soaked funeral for Ryu Jin.

A bloody festival to console a flower that had not fully bloomed.

Lee Gwak’s entire body was soaked in the blood of the Ghost Sword Squad.

“Damn it! Where did this inhuman beast come from…”

Ok Mu-yeon ground his teeth.

He unknowingly stepped back.

For the first time, he regretted coming without Dan Li-yeon.

He had been holding a grudge against her for the beating he’d received at her hands in the Cho Family Manor. So he’d deliberately come here without her, as a petty revenge of his own.

Before arriving here, he felt proud, but at this moment, he regretted it deeply.

Ok Mu-yeon unleashed his ultimate technique, the Ghost Blood Seven Swords.

Whoosh!

His sword, filled with a sinister aura, fanned out like blades in an assault on Lee Gwak.

The Ghost Blood Seven Swords were rumored to be able to drink the blood of ghosts. It was because of this technique that Ok Mu-yeon had earned the nickname “Ice Soul Ghost Sword.”

Naturally, its power was tremendous.

Boom!

“Ugh!”

Yet even this formidable technique was snuffed out by a single stroke of Lee Gwak’s blade.

Ok Mu-yeon couldn’t withstand the shock and was flung backward. His hands gripping the sword were torn, bleeding profusely.

He forcibly suppressed the surge of nausea. His face was pale, his hair completely disheveled, resembling a madman.

One blow had shattered his guard, leaving his insides shaken.

Lee Gwak’s power was unimaginable.

Ok Mu-yeon’s face turned pale as he stepped back.

He didn’t dare to clash a second time. That’s how overwhelming Lee Gwak’s martial prowess was—enough to terrify even the infamous Ice Soul Ghost Sword.

Lee Gwak charged toward the retreating Ok Mu-yeon.

Swoosh!

Moving like a swift swallow skimming over water, Lee Gwak closed in. He had executed his Revolving Steps.

Swoosh!

The piercing sound of death echoed.

At that moment, Ok Mu-yeon sensed his own death.

‘Damn!’

Gritting his teeth, Ok Mu-yeon tried to unleash a suicidal attack.

At that moment, a sharp voice echoed across the battlefield.

“Spare him!”

Whoosh!

A powerful surge of qi shot towards Lee Gwak like a thunderbolt.

Relief washed over Ok Mu-yeon’s face.

‘She’s here.’

He sensed Dan Li-yeon’s presence.

That kind of formidable fist qi was her trademark. Her concentrated internal energy could shatter even a massive boulder. To withstand it with one’s bare body was almost impossible.

Ok Mu-yeon thought Lee Gwak would withdraw his blade to defend. The thought of surviving naturally brought a smile to his face.

But contrary to his expectations, Lee Gwak did not withdraw his blade. He didn’t even turn his body to defend.

Ok Mu-yeon’s eyes widened.

Squelch!

Lee Gwak’s blade pierced his chest.

At that moment, Dan Li-yeon’s powerful fist struck Lee Gwak’s back.

Crash!

Lee Gwak’s body shuddered.

A trace of blood appeared on his lips, but he wasn’t seriously wounded.

He had momentarily deployed protective qi to neutralize Dan Li-yeon’s fist attack. But Dan Li-yeon’s attack was so strong that he couldn’t avoid suffering some minor internal injury. Still, Lee Gwak didn’t mind.

He had only suffered a slight injury, but Ok Mu-yeon had his heart pierced through.

Like a fish skewered on a harpoon, Ok Mu-yeon’s body trembled.

His face was filled with disbelief.

“Ugh! How could I…”

He tried desperately to pull out Lee Gwak’s blade with both hands. But the more he tried, the deeper Lee Gwak’s blade dug into his chest.

“Argh!”

Feeling as if his soul was being severed, Ok Mu-yeon opened his mouth wide. He vomited a large amount of dark red blood.

Lee Gwak looked at Ok Mu-yeon’s face indifferently.

“You… demon…”

Suddenly!

At that moment, Lee Gwak’s blade completely penetrated his heart and protruded from his back.

Ok Mu-yeon could say no more. His lips moved a few times, and then his head drooped.

Only then did Lee Gwak withdraw his blade.

Thud!

Ok Mu-yeon’s body collapsed like a sandcastle.

“Phew!”

Only then did Lee Gwak exhale the breath he had been holding.

At that moment, a woman wearing a black veil descended from the sky.

She was none other than Dan Li-yeon.

“Sigh!”

Rip!

Dan Li-yeon sighed and tore off the black veil covering her face.

A look of emptiness appeared on her face.

She had overexerted herself to launch a fist attack to save Ok Mu-yeon. She didn’t expect to deal a significant blow to Lee Gwak since she had launched it from so far away. But she believed without doubt that it would be enough to save Ok Mu-yeon. However, Lee Gwak completely ignored her attack and severed Ok Mu-yeon’s lifeline.

Her expression contorted with frustration.

Although Ok Mu-yeon hadn’t behaved well, he was still an important figure in the Jade Heaven Alliance. He was a tool of her master, Ja Hong-cheon, and her ally.

Now, she had lost that ally so easily. This realization brought both fury and fear into Dan Li-yeon’s heart.

She stared at Lee Gwak.

Even though she hadn’t unleashed her full power, her attack could shatter a boulder. She was curious about the identity of the person, who had neutralized such an attack by instantly deploying his qi.

Dan Li-yeon asked.

“Who are you?”

“……”

“Daring to commit slaughter against the martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance—do you think you’ll get away with it?”

Whether she liked it or not, Ok Mu-yeon was someone she had to take responsibility for. Losing such a subordinate in vain stirred up anger in her heart.

“Why won’t you answer? Are you too afraid to reveal your name?”

“It seems you don’t remember me.”

“What?”

Dan Li-yeon frowned deeply at Lee Gwak’s words. There was something about the way he spoke—it felt like he knew her well.

Now that she looked closely, his face seemed oddly familiar.

It was a face she was sure she’d seen somewhere before.

“Ah!”

After rummaging through her memories for a while, Dan Li-yeon unknowingly exclaimed. She finally recalled Lee Gwak.

“You’re Squad Leader Lee of the Outer Hall?”

“It’s been a while, Miss Dan.”

“My goodness! It really is you. But… how?”

Dan Li-yeon stared at Lee Gwak in disbelief.

In her memory, Lee Gwak was merely a squad leader in the Outer Hall of the Jade Heaven Alliance. Then, three years ago, he had suddenly made a name for himself, surprising everyone—including her.

Especially in the fight against Yong Cheon-myeong, the martial prowess he displayed was unbelievably impressive. But after that day, he disappeared from the Jianghu and faded from her memory. That same Lee Gwak had reappeared.

Dan Li-yeon bit her lip.

Lee Gwak had instantly deployed protective qi to neutralize her attack. He seemed much stronger than before.

For a moment, Dan Li-yeon couldn’t decide what to say.

The Lee Gwak she remembered was definitely a martial artist affiliated with the Jade Heaven Alliance. She couldn’t understand why such a person now stood before her as an enemy of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

After thinking for a moment, Dan Li-yeon spoke.

“Squad Leader Lee! Are you saying that your actions here are a declaration of rebellion against the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

“Yes. You can see it that way.”

Lee Gwak’s response came without a moment’s hesitation.

At his unexpected answer, Dan Li-yeon was momentarily stunned. But soon, a look of anger appeared on her face.

Of all people, she could never accept a former member of the Jade Heaven Alliance turning against it.

Even if the whole world became its enemy, those who had served the Alliance should remain loyal. She herself had many issues with the Alliance’s path, as well as with her master, but she continued to follow them because she had no choice.

Now, Lee Gwak’s answer violated her values.

Dan Li-yeon’s voice grew cold.

“Why?”

Lee Gwak’s gaze turned to the corpse of Cho Ryu-jin, who was held in Lee Cheong’s arms. Dan Li-yeon also looked at Cho Ryu-jin.

For a moment, her delicate eyebrows furrowed.

“What’s with that child?”

“His name is Cho Ryu-jin.”

“Cho Ryu-jin? Then…”

“He is the last survivor of the Cho family manor that you annihilated.”

“……”

Dan Li-yeon closed her mouth. Her face was filled with a sense of devastation. She now understood why Lee Gwak had turned against them.

“Squad Leader Leei…”

“Did you really have to do that? Was the Jade Heaven Alliance so desperate that you had to take the life of such a young child? Or were you inherently such evil beings?”

“That’s a misunderstanding. Let me explain.”

“I won’t listen.”

“Leader Lee?”

“I’m not a squad leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

Shhk!

Lee Gwak raised his blade and cut off his own sleeve.

It was a display of his intent to sever ties with the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Until now, he had never thought of rebelling against the Jade Heaven Alliance or had grand ambitions of ending the chaotic times.

Since he started as a mere outer hall martial artist, his scope of thought was that limited, and his aspirations were not that big. At most, his concerns were his own safety and his family’s happiness.

But with Cho Ryu-jin’s death, his thoughts changed.

When he first met him, he’d believed he could protect him. Confidently, he had escaped without eliminating the Ghost Sword Squad in advance, dismissing them as a mere nuisance.

It had been his arrogance.

If he had eliminated the Ghost Sword Squad then, he wouldn’t have lost Cho Ryu-jin so meaninglessly.

It was a disaster brought about by his own conceit.

His arrogant belief that he could protect him from any danger prevented the young flower named Cho Ryu-jin from blooming.

His master, Lunatic Pugilist Gwang Noh-ya, had said:

“One way or another, the moment of choice will come.”

Now was that very moment.

Shring!

Lee Gwak raised his blade and pointed it at Dan Li-yeon.
