The Sun Does Not Set Just Because a Storm Is Blowing (2)

Ja Seol-gyeong looked calmly at the woman sitting across from her.

It was Han So-cheon; she was so beautiful that it was hard to believe she was the mother of two children.

When she had briefly stepped out of the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall and learned that Ja Seol-gyeong had visited, she had been shocked.

If the Invincible Sword, Ja Seol-gyeong, had harbored ill intentions, her children would never have been safe.

Fortunately, Ja Seol-gyeong turned out to be acquainted with Han So-cheon’s husband, Lee Gwak. She bore no hostility toward Han So-cheon or her children. Instead, she had made it possible for them to stay comfortably in Mount Sohua.

Thanks to that, Han So-cheon could focus on honing her martial arts without worrying about outside attention.

As they spent more time together, their bond deepened.

Ja Seol-gyeong enjoyed sharing tea and conversation, but there were few people in the Mount Hua sect who could engage in leisurely talks with her.

Hence, she cherished her casual conversations with Han So-cheon over tea. She seemed to know when Han So-cheon would take a break, and would mysteriously appear, already prepared with tea.

Even now, she was boiling water in a kettle to make tea.

While checking the temperature of the water, Ja Seol-gyeong spoke,

“They say some of the best teas come from famous temples. There’s some truth to that. Monks have enjoyed tea since ancient times, and temples in famous mountains often grew their own. The Sweet Dew tea is no exception. It gained fame after Taoist Master Bo-hye of Ganlu Temple on Mong Mountain cultivated it himself and presented it to the emperor. They say a single sip washes away all worldly troubles—its flavor is that profound. Once you taste it, I’m sure you’ll love it too.”

“Thanks to you, my tongue is living in luxury,” Han So-cheon replied with a slight smile. “I’m actually worried that I might get spoiled.”

Han So-cheon referred to Ja Seol-gyeong as “unnie”

Although there was an age gap and a difference in rank between them, they had become close enough to use familiar terms like unnie and little sister.

It wasn’t only men who could forge bonds of camaraderie. Through an unexpected twist of fate, the two women had found a connection. They decided to share sisterly affection, chatting over tea whenever time allowed. Before long, they became comfortable enough to shed all formality.

Under their influence, Lee Cheong, Lee Soo-ah, and Hong Chae-yeon had also become comfortable with one another.

While the two women chatted, the children practiced martial arts and sparred with each other.

Drip… drip…

After pouring the sweet dew tea into a cup, Ja Seol-gyeong handed it to Han So-cheon.

“Here, try it.”

“Thank you.”

Han So-cheon accepted the cup with both hands.

The fragrant aroma of the tea stimulated her senses. She took a careful sip.

With just one taste, her mind felt clearer.

“It’s really good.”

“Right? That’s why I enjoy this tea so much. I’ll share some with you—drink it when you’re alone.”

“Thank you. I keep imposing on you—what am I to do?”

“Imposing? It’s just sharing what I have. Don’t feel burdened.”

Ja Seol-gyeong smiled warmly.

Han So-cheon smiled back as she looked at her.

Ja Seol-gyeong felt like a true older sister to her.

The feeling was mutual. To Ja Seol-gyeong, Han So-cheon was like a younger sister, and she wanted to give her even more.

The two women talked for a long time.

“Unnie, there’s something I’ve been curious about.”

“What is it?”

“You’re part of the Mount Hua Sect, right?”

“That’s right.”

“I heard that the Mount Hua sect closed its gates over a hundred years ago. Do you know why?”

“So you’re curious as to why our sect has remained secluded all this time.”

“Yes.”

Han So-cheon nodded.

Despite her experience in the Jianghu, she didn’t know much. She had no idea why the Mount Hua sect had closed its gates.

Ja Seol-gyeong paused for a moment before speaking.

“It was an unavoidable choice.”

“What do you mean?”

“Back then, several of the Nine Great Sects were destroyed, and the rest had lost most of their strength and were on the verge of collapse.”

“Ah!”

“It was inevitable at the time. All the Nine Great Sects suffered heavy losses in the war against the Demonic Cult. Most of their core martial artists died, and those who remained were either too young or too weak. In that situation, seclusion was the best way to protect the sect. Mount Hua was relatively better off thanks to the protection of the Fist Demon, but the Wudang Sect and Shaolin Temple were in the worst state.”

The scars left by the Great Heavenly Blood War were so deep that sects like Wudang and Shaolin were on the verge of extinction. Seclusion was not a choice, it was a necessity.

For over a century, the three sects focused on recovering their strength while remaining secluded.

As a result, Mount Hua had regained power comparable to its golden age.

Ja Seol-gyeong was proof of that.

She had risen to the ranks of the Eight Great Martial Artists, proving that Mount Hua’s martial prowess was on par with the Ten Great Sects.

“What about Wudang and Shaolin?”

“I don’t know if you’re aware, but Wudang has deep ties with the Nine Dragons Clan. The founder of the Nine Dragons Clan was once an outer disciple of Wudang. That connection remains unbroken, so their strength likely isn’t far behind the Nine Dragons Clan. They might even surpass them.”

“Hmm.”

Han So-cheon let out a thoughtful sound.

It was hard to believe.

“What about Shaolin?”

“I don’t know about them. We’ve had no contact.”

“Even though you were both part of the Nine Great Sects?”

“We were close in the past, but after secluding ourselves, all ties were cut. With Wudang, we could get news through the Nine Dragons Clan, but Shaolin completely shut its doors and severed all outside communication. That’s why I don’t know anything about their internal affairs.”

“I see.”

“One thing is certain. The previous Nine Great Sects—well, only five remain now, so maybe we should call them the Five Great Sects? Anyway, if even one of them reopens its gates, the others will likely emerge as well. Right now, they’re lumped together as part of the Ten Great Sects, but the Five Great Sects’ potential isn’t limited to that. Mount Hua alone could rival the Ten Great Sects if we reopened our gates. I’m sure Wudang and Shaolin are no different.”

“To… that extent?”

Han So-cheon looked skeptical. Ja Seol-gyeong set down her teacup and continued.

Tap.

“That’s a conservative estimate. The Ten Great Sects—well, excluding the Jade Heaven Alliance, it’s down to seven now—no matter how strong they are, their history spans barely a century. Meanwhile, Mount Hua, Wudang, and Shaolin have reigned as Jianghu’s leaders for hundreds of years. Even if they declined temporarily, their foundations surpass the Ten Great Sects. If they actively reenter the world, the balance of Jianghu will be shaken.”

“Hmm.”

“But don’t worry too much. At least Mount Hua has no ambition to return to Jianghu yet. As for Wudang and Shaolin, I’m not sure. I can’t read their minds.

“If they reopen their gates too, the Jianghu will descend into chaos.”

“Probably.”

Ja Seol-gyeong nodded slowly.

Mount Hua itself was currently divided between two groups—those who wanted to reopen the gates and restore the sect’s glory, and those who believed they should accumulate more strength first.

If Ja Seol-gyeong had not supported the latter, Mount Hua would have reopened its gates long ago.

She assumed Wudang and Shaolin were in similar situations. Human nature was much the same everywhere.

Drip… drip…

Ja Seol-gyeong refilled the empty teacup and spoke again.

“Don’t worry too much. Wudang and Shaolin were once leaders of the martial world. They have experience and clear principles. They won’t recklessly reopen their gates and add to the chaos in these troubled times.”

Her voice carried certainty.

Han So-cheon sipped her tea and nodded slowly. Seeing her, Ja Seol-gyeong changed the subject.

“Are you going back to the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall?”

“I have to.”

“You should rest a little. Aren’t you pushing yourself too hard?”

“I feel like I’m on the verge of a breakthrough.”

“Oh?”

Ja Seol-gyeong looked intrigued.

Han So-cheon’s skills were far from weak. If she said this, it likely meant she was on the brink of a breakthrough.

‘What kind of enlightenment does an assassin seek?’

Curiosity flickered in her mind.

Ja Seol-gyeong set down her teacup and rose from her seat.

“Then shall I go with you?”

“You too, sister?”

“I’ve always been curious about the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall.”

Ja Seol-gyeong smiled warmly.

“Huff, huff!”

Cheon-wol gasped for breath.

Beads of sweat rolled down his flushed face and his chest heaved violently. His half-healed wounds had reopened and blood was trickling out, but he didn’t even feel the pain.

Instead, he smiled as if he felt relieved.

Lee Gwak looked down at him.

“Are you alright?”

“It’s good. Thank you, brother!”

“To thank me after getting beaten up like that?”

Lee Gwak chuckled.

Cheon-wol had come at him with everything he had, so Lee Gwak couldn’t hold back either. It would’ve been disrespectful to go easy on someone fighting for their life.

So, Lee Gwak gave it his all.

Though he adjusted his internal energy to match Cheon-wol’s level, he did not hold back his skills.

Cheon-wol was knocked down over and over.

If this had been a real fight, he would’ve died long ago.

Yet, no matter how many times he was thrown to the ground, Cheon-wol stubbornly got back up and charged again.

With each clash and failure, his movements grew sharper.

Lee Gwak pushed him to his absolute limit.

This was the first time Cheon-wol had ever been pushed so far in his martial training. And in doing so, he began to realize something—the enlightenment Lee Gwak had intended for him.

As they sparred, Lee Gwak saw Cheon-wol’s flaws and weaknesses.

He relentlessly targeted them.

Attack after attack, like a drill piercing through a single point.

Even with the same technique and force, Cheon-wol couldn’t defend himself and was sent flying every time.

He had to desperately figure out how to protect himself. In the process, his weaknesses gradually faded, and the path forward became clear.

Cheon-wol stood up and said,

“Thanks, hyung! Now I know what I need to do.”

“Good.”

Just as Lee Gwak nodded—

“Oraboni, time to eat!”

Bang Ye-in’s voice called from a distance.

Lee Gwak and Cheon-wol walked toward the sound.

At the edge of the clearing where the escort bureau was camped, Bang Ye-in, Cheol Gwang-woo, and Seok Yi-cheon were waiting for them.

And an unexpected person was with them.

“Come join us.”

It was Oh Jung-gyeong.

Lee Gwak frowned slightly.

“Here to freeload?”

“Hah! Don’t be so stingy. After tasting Lady Bang’s cooking, I can’t stomach anything else.”

“Shouldn’t the escort chief share the same fate as his escorts?”

“We share the same fate, but meals are separate. Ahem!”

Oh Jung-gyeong coughed awkwardly and looked away.

After accidentally tasting Bang Ye-in’s cooking, he had started showing up at meals. Compared to her food, the food that the agency made was practically slop.

Once you’ve tasted something exquisite, everything else pales in comparison.

Oh Jung-gyeong shamelessly spoke,

“Why just stand there? Aren’t you going to eat?”

“Of course.”

Lee Gwak smirked and sat down with Cheon-wol.

Seok Yi-cheon pulled Cheon-wol beside him.

“You must be starving, huh?”

“I’m fine.”

“Fine, my ass. Eat up.”

“Yes!”

Seok Yi-cheon piled Cheon-wol’s plate high with Bang Ye-in’s food.

Cheon-wol bowed slightly to her in thanks, and she smiled back before sitting beside Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak spoke to her,

“Thanks.”

“For what?”

“For being so considerate, even though we’re behind schedule.”

“What else could I do? People come before business.”

Because of Cheon-wol’s sparring, they were running late.

Now, making it to the meeting at the Bang Family Inn on time was impossible.

“I appreciate it. Thanks for understanding.”

“I’m not so petty that I can’t understand what’s right in front of me. So don’t worry about it.”

Lee Gwak smiled at her thoughtful words.

Seok Yi-cheon was chatting loudly with Cheon-wol, while Oh Jung-gyeong and Cheol Gwang-woo were deep in discussion over their meal.

Because of them, this journey didn’t feel lonely.

They were people to be grateful for.
