Jin Woo-seon’s nickname was Jade Kirin.

He was the young master of the Zealous Justice Clan, one of the Ten Sects, and a member of the Ten Lesser Skies.

In the northern region where the Zealous Justice Clan was established, there was no martial artist stronger than him. Among the younger martial artists, he was undoubtedly the best, and even when compared to the already famous martial artists in the Jianghu, there weren’t many who could be considered superior to him.

With his strong martial arts, handsome looks as if carved from jade, hence his sobriquet was Jade Kirin.

Jin Woo-seon boasted an unbeaten legend, having never lost once.

Naturally, Jin Woo-seon’s pride was sky-high.

He looked at the young martial artist standing in front of him with an arrogant gaze.

For a moment, a flash of jealousy passed through his eyes.

Being called Jade Kirin meant Jin Woo-seon was handsome. This made him extremely proud of his looks. However, the young martial artist in front of him was far more handsome than he was.

Not just handsome, the young martial artist possessed a decadence that did not exist in Jin Woo-seon. The strange atmosphere, as if he was not of this world, overwhelmingly surpassed Jin Woo-seon.

Jin Woo-seon furrowed his brows.

“Are you the one who sent me the challenge letter?”

“Do you know who I am and still sent the challenge?”

“Jade Kirin Jin Woo-seon. Young Master of the Zealous Justice Clan and a member of the Ten Lesser Skies. If what I know is correct, then I have sent the challenge to the right person.”

Jin Woo-seon’s eyes narrowed at the young martial artist’s response.

He had received the challenge letter last night.

Since being recognized as the successor of the Zealous Justice Clan’s master, no one had dared to challenge him. Had the challenge been delivered through normal means, he wouldn’t have shown up. But he had no choice this time.

The challenge letter was found right beside his pillow.

His quarters were protected by layers of strict security. Penetrating all these defenses to approach him was impossible.

Above all, Jin Woo-seon himself was a master who had reached the ascension realm. Naturally, he possessed an almost superhuman sensitivity.

It was impossible to deceive him within a ten-zhang radius, even when he was asleep. However, Jin Woo-seon had no idea that the person who had left the challenge had visited him.

If the person who left the challenge had harbored malicious intent, he would have been dead. That’s Jin Woo-seon came here.

To see the person who had managed to deceive his senses and left the challenge unnoticed.

Jin Woo-seon slightly frowned. It was a name he had never heard before.

A faint smile formed on the lips of the man who introduced himself as Go Geom Wol.

“It’s no surprise you haven’t heard of me, as I’ve never been active in the Jianghu.”

“Then, you’re new to Jianghu?”

“Defeat me. Then, I’ll tell you.”

Go Geom Wol shrugged his shoulders. His attitude was so relaxed that he did not seem like someone who had come for a duel.

Jin Woo-seon realized that his opponent was underestimating him.

Naturally, his expression hardened.

“Fine! I accept your challenge.”

Jin Woo-seon drew the sword he was carrying at his waist.

The sword, emitting a chillingly cold light, was named Blood Sky, a divine weapon.

It was renowned as the sharpest and most durable weapon in the world.

Go Geom Wol nodded at the sight.

“A unity of body and sword. You understand the sword well.”

“Aren’t you drawing your weapon?”

It was as smooth and unblemished as a delicate woman’s hand.

“To carry a sword at your waist but not draw it, you must find me too insignificant.”

“It’s not that I undervalue you by not drawing my sword. Since I became an adult, I’ve only drawn my sword against another person once.”

The moment Go Geom Wol slightly nodded his head, Jin Woo-seon kicked off the ground and rushed in.

Blood Sky tore through the air towards him.

Go Geom Wol did not avoid the sword but instead ran towards it.

His approach, with the intent to clash against the sword, seemed like that of a man desperate to meet his death.

Go Geom Wol’s hand collided with Blood Sky, and a metallic clang erupted.

Jin Woo-seon’s complexion changed in that instant.

The counterforce felt from Blood Sky was beyond imagination.

A groan involuntarily escaped from Jin Woo-seon’s mouth.

Only then did Jin Woo-seon realize that Go Geom Wol’s confidence was not unfounded.

What Go Geom Wol had displayed was one of the supreme hand techniques of the demonic path, the Bloodlight Hand.

A fierce qi storm raged around the two fighters.

Jin Woo-seon unleashed the secret sword technique of the Zealous Justice Clan, the Soul-Chasing Shattering Spirit Sword, with all his might.

The sword in his hand, Blood Sky, radiated a red light true to its name. It was undoubtedly a sword qi.

The sword qi, capable of slicing through three-inch-thick iron plates in a single stroke, couldn’t even scratch Go Geom Wol’s bare hands.

In an instant, more than thirty exchanges had passed.

Jin Woo-seon’s complexion turned deathly pale.

To outsiders, it might seem he had grown weary after just thirty seconds of combat, but he had truly exerted all his strength.

Judging that dragging the fight into a prolonged battle would be disadvantageous, he had tried to decide the outcome within thirty seconds, squeezing out all his power.

However, he was unable to inflict any damage on Go Geom Wol standing before him.

‘How could such a martial artist remain unknown until now?’

He saw an insurmountable wall in Go Geom Wol.

The existence of such a martial artist in the same era was nothing short of a disaster.

Jin Woo-seon’s face contorted even more.

The red glow emanating from his sword gradually faded away.

On the other hand, Go Geom Wol’s eyes shone even brighter.

The storm named Go Geom Wol struck Jin Woo-seon.

Lee Gwak connected Nam Woo Gyeong with Lim Sobo.

Normally, Nam Woo Gyeong would have hesitated to join hands with the Secret Court, but after being attacked by the Blood Rain Assassins, he realized that the situation in the world was turning grave and readily promised to cooperate with Lim Sobo.

After connecting the two, Lee Gwak moved his residence to a nearby inn. Cheol Gwang Woo insisted on following him, but he barely managed to dissuade him, saying that someone needed to protect Nam Woo Gyeong for the time being.

Since all he had was a small bundle to carry on his back, moving residences was not difficult.

What troubled Lee Gwak was the affectionate look in Cho ha’s eyes as he left.

Lee Gwak was no fool. He knew exactly what Cho ha’s look meant. Yet, he heartlessly moved residences.

The human heart is curious in that once it is fully occupied by one person, there is no room for another.

If Lee Gwak had met Cho ha before Han So-cheon, his decision might have been different. But now, his heart was entirely filled with Han So-cheon, leaving no room for anyone else.

Lee Gwak let out a soft sigh after settling down in the inn.

He thought things should have been like this from the beginning. Then, his heart wouldn’t have been so heavy.

Shaking his head slightly, Lee Gwak went down to the dining room on the first floor.

It was still broad daylight, so the inn was quiet. Lee Gwak ordered some simple snacks from the owner and sat by the window.

His purpose for seeking out the Jade Heaven Alliance was to gather information about Han So-cheon. However, no one knew of Han So-cheon’s whereabouts.

Not Nam Woo Gyeong, nor even Lim Sobo.

I should confirm So-cheon’s whereabouts with the leader of the Hidden Blood Squad before leaving this place.

The longer he stayed, the more likely he was to get caught up in big trouble.

Lee Gwak thought about how he could meet the leader of the Hidden Blood Squad. But no matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t come up with a suitable method.

It was when Lee Gwak sighed again that a group of about ten men suddenly entered the inn.

“So, this is the place known for brewing exceptional liquor?”

“That’s correct. The liquor here is the best I’ve tasted recently.”

The man who appeared to be the leader licked his lips in anticipation.

The moment Lee Gwak saw his face, his eyes lit up. It was a face he recognized.

It was Maeng Hee-cheon, the leader of the Outer Hall .

Once, Maeng Hee-cheon had been Lee Gwak’s superior. Back then, Lee Gwak thought of him as someone high above, unreachable, but now, he didn’t feel as intimidated as he remembered.

The men Maeng Hee-cheon brought with him were all squad leaders of the outer hall. It seemed he had brought all the squad leaders who were currently off duty.

Lee Gwak discreetly scanned the faces to see if he recognized anyone, but they were all strangers. They were likely new recruits who joined after Lee Gwak left the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Not wanting to get involved in any troublesome matters, Lee Gwak slightly turned his head and looked out the window.

That’s when Maeng Hee-cheon raised his voice to the innkeeper.

“Yes! I’ll bring it right away.”

“Of course. How could I not know the great hero of the Outer Hall? I’ll prepare the finest snacks for you right away.”

Maeng Hee-cheon smiled in satisfaction at the innkeeper’s flattery.

Although Maeng Hee-cheon was only part of the lowest organization within the Jade Heaven Alliance, to the people living near the Jade Heaven Alliance’s base, he was more fearsome than the King of Hell.

Angering Maeng Hee-cheon could mean the ruin of an establishment like this inn in no time.

The innkeeper catered to Maeng Hee-cheon’s tastes with the most servile smile possible.

Lee Gwak’s order had long been forgotten by the innkeeper, who directed the kitchen to prioritize Maeng Hee-cheon’s party.

As the liquor was served first, the atmosphere in the inn grew even more boisterous.

One of the chiefs rubbed his hands and flattered Maeng Hee-cheon.

“Hehe! Now all that’s left is for you to become the outer court master.”

“Even if you become the outer court master, please lead us well. We only trust in you.”

“It seems the path for our leader has finally opened.”

Following one’s flattery, others also chimed in, not wanting to miss the opportunity.

Maeng Hee-cheon struggled to suppress his rising corners of the mouth, maintaining a dignified expression.

“Don’t talk nonsense. Saying such things elsewhere could lead to trouble.”

“But it’s just us here, what does it matter?”

“That’s right. And it’s practically a foregone conclusion that the current outer court master master will step down, isn’t it? The injuries he sustained in the battle against the Celestial Demon Troupe haven’t healed but have worsened. He can’t properly perform his duties as the outer court master, so it’s natural for you to succeed him.”

The current outer court master was the Hundred-faced Fox Geum Gu Ho .

Like the fox with a hundred faces suggested by his nickname, he was clever and had successfully carried out the role of the outer court master for a long time.

However, he had been seriously injured in the war against the Celestial Demon Troupe a few years ago, and had recently been unable to perform his duties as the Outer Court Master.

Despite the attention of the world’s famous physicians, his injuries had not healed perfectly.

Thus, rumors spread within the Alliance that Geum Gu Ho would step down, and a new outer court master would be chosen.

Naturally, Maeng Hee-cheon harbored ambitions to become the next outer court master.

Above all, he had served as the leader of the outer hall, which was directly under the outer court Master, for a long time and believed his abilities to be outstanding.

‘If the outer court Master is appointed from outside, it’s uncertain, but if it’s a promotion from within, it will be either me or Ma Il-ju.’

Ma Il-ju was the leader of Jade Heaven Alliance’s intelligence organization, Heavenly Intelligence Hall.

Currently, Ma Il-ju was Maeng Hee-cheon’s strongest competitor.

That’s why Maeng Hee-cheon was paying special attention to Ma Il-ju’s movements while putting effort into managing the squad leaders of the outer hall.

Every man harbors the ambition to rise to higher places. Maeng Hee-cheon was no different.

‘The position of outer court Master is mine. I will definitely secure it.’

Maeng Hee-cheon’s eyes blazed intensely, as if flames were about to erupt from them.

He looked at the chiefs with eyes full of fervor.

Maeng Hee-cheon raised a cup full of liquor and said,

“What chief? To the Outer Court master.”

“Then, to the Outer Court master.”

The chiefs called Maeng Hee-cheon the Outer Court master and raised their cups.

They clinked their glasses and gulped down the liquor.

The atmosphere heated up even in the broad daylight.

The squad leaders were already hailing Maeng Hee-cheon as the outer court Master.

Maeng Hee-cheon looked around with a pleased smile.

Suddenly, his eyes caught something.

The back of a man sitting by the window seemed strangely familiar. He tried not to pay attention, but his gaze involuntarily drifted there. Like a tiny splinter under a fingernail, it kept bothering him.

Eventually, Maeng Hee-cheon put down his cup on the table and stood up.

The chiefs looked at Maeng Hee-cheon with puzzled eyes. But Maeng Hee-cheon, paying them no heed, walked towards the man sitting by the window.
