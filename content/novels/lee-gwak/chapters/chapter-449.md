There was an unusually red fortress.

Seize Fortress.

It was the name of the fortress located at the forefront of the war between the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Celestial Demon Troupe.

It was also the name of the fortress positioned at the forefront of the war between the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Celestial Demon Troupe.

In the past, it was a peaceful city where thousands lived. Now, however, it serves as a stronghold for the Jade Heaven Alliance.

The entire city had been fortified, and massive amounts of military supplies had been stockpiled. Thanks to that, it could survive for over a year without external support, even if it were completely cut off.

To the Jade Heaven Alliance, Seize Fortress was more than just a fortress.

It was a symbol of victory, an unbreakable mark of invincibility.

The pride of the martial artists stationed in the Seize Fortress was beyond measure.

As if to prove their pride, the surface of Seize Fortress bore countless scars of battle. Deep gashes and blood-red stains painted a terrifying sight for any first-time visitor.

After the war with the Celestial Demon Troupe ended, Seize Fortress faded from people’s memories.

It was a place that only drew attention when war broke out. In times of peace, not even the Jade Heaven Alliance paid it any mind.

Other than the occasional supply run every few months, no one visited the Seize Fortress.

Because of this, the fortress had a desolate, almost haunting atmosphere.

At a glance, it seemed like an abandoned fortress. But in truth, many people still resided within its walls.

“Hah!”

“Chat!”

The shouts of martial artists echoed from the training grounds at the center of Seize Fortress.

Dozens of shirtless men trained in martial arts while a middle-aged man in a red uniform watched them silently.

His exposed skin bore countless scars, like brands testifying to a life of hardship.

His name was Seo Jong-myeong, but here in Seize Fortress, he was known as the Heartless Demon Sword.

With a strict expression, Seo Jong-myeong observed the martial artists’ training.

Though only dozens were currently training, over four hundred martial artists resided in Seize Fortress.

Seo Jong-myeong made time to train them regularly. But due to the constant need to monitor Celestial Demon Troupe’s movements, it was impossible for all to train at once.

That was always a regret for him.

As the ceasefire with the Celestial Demon Troupe dragged on, the Jade Heaven Alliance effectively abandoned Seize Fortress, sending only minimal supplies. And life within the fortress became increasingly tough.

They had endured so far, fueled by their hatred of the Celestial Demon Troupe. However, that hatred had reached its limit. And many had already left.

Those who remained held deep, personal grudges against the Celestial Demon Troupe. They clung to their desire for vengeance, but Seo Jong-myeong knew it wouldn’t last forever.

“Phew…”

Unconsciously, Seo Jong-myeong let out a sigh.

Just then, a man in his early thirties approached him.

“The ground might cave in from that sigh. What troubles you?”

It was Yul Mu-han, Seo Jong-myeong’s right-hand man.

“Was I sighing?”

“Yes. Something troubling you?”

“What trouble?”

Seo Jong-myeong shook his head but couldn’t completely erase the worry from his face.

“You’ve got it rough, commander. You could be somewhere much more comfortable, yet you choose to remain here.”

“Isn’t that the same for you?”

“Well, I won’t leave until I’ve crushed every last one of those Celestial Demon Troupe bastards.”

“Same here.”

“Sigh… I guess we’re destined to die and become ghosts of this place.”

“That’s our fate, I suppose. Hmph!”

For the first time, Seo Jong-myeong laughed.

Yul Mu-han smiled as well.

Having spent years together, they knew each other better than anyone else. Neither had any intention of leaving, even in death.

Clap!

Yul Mu-han suddenly clapped his hands as if he had just remembered something.

“By the way, your sworn younger brother has become quite the sensation lately.”

“Younger brother?”

“Master Lee Gwak.”

“Ah!”

A smile crept onto Seo Jong-myeong’s lips.

Even in isolation, news from the Jianghu reached them.

The most frequent stories were of Lee Gwak.

Tales of him defeating the Jianghu’s absolute masters had spread even to Seize Fortress.

“That brat’s really something. Who would’ve guessed that he would rise to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the absolute masters?”

“If I’d known, I would’ve treated him better.”

“Regrets?”

“Just joking. I chose to be stuck here. What’s there to regret?”

Yul Mu-han, like Seo Jong-myeong, held deep resentment towards the Celestial Demon Troupe. That’s why he stayed and served him.

Seo Jong-myeong spoke to him,

“Once things calm down, let’s go out into the Jianghu. Meet Gwak, eat some good food, and enjoy ourselves.”

“I’d love that.”

Yul Mu-han’s eyes lit up, but he knew.

No matter what they said, Seo Jong-myeong would never leave the Siege Fortress.

While the two exchanged friendly words—

“Commander!”

A man in his mid-thirties came running up, his voice filled with urgency.

Seo Jong-myeong and Yul Mu-han exchanged glances.

The man belonged to Shadowless Squad, Seo Jong-myeong’s personal combat unit. Having shared life and death for years, they knew each other’s habits better than anyone.

If the Shadowless Squad was this agitated, the situation must be dire.

“What is it?”

“Suspicious movements have been detected to the west.”

“The west?”

Seo Jong-myeong’s brows furrowed.

The west was the direction of the Celestial Demon Troupe.

“Are you sure?”

“Our scouts spotted a group moving this way. A few stayed behind to monitor them.”

Upon hearing this, Seo Jong-myeong and Yul Moo-han’s expressions hardened.

“Could they be making a move again?”

“We need to confirm. I’ll go myself.”

“Hmm.”

Seo Jong-myeong nodded at Yul Moo-han’s words.

Ding! Ding! Ding!

He rang the emergency bell himself. The martial artists stopped their training and gathered before him.

Seo Jong-myeong addressed them:

“There’s suspicious movement to the west. Prepare for battle immediately.”

“Yes, sir!”

As they responded, Yul Mu-han took a few trusted men and slipped out of Seige Fortress. They were hardened veterans who were loyal and swift.

They moved toward the direction indicated by the scouts.

‘Please, let it not be the Celestial Demon Troupe…’

Though Yul Mu-han yearned to fight the Celestial Demon Troupe, he also hoped war wouldn’t break out.

He bore deep personal grudges, but he also knew war brought suffering to many.

As they neared the location—

“There should be a mark nearby. Find it.”

Scouts always left hidden signs for allies to follow.

But what they heard next was disappointing.

“There’s no sign.”

“I don’t see anything either.”

Under normal circumstances, that wouldn’t happen. This meant that it wasn’t normal.

“Be on your guard.”

“Yes, sir!”

Just as the subordinates answered—

Shreeek!

A sharp whistling sound tore through the air.

“Gahk!”

Before anyone could react, one of Yul Mu-han’s men flew backward, screaming. A small axe was buried deep in his chest.

Yul Mu-han’s eyes widened.

“Ambush!”

In that instant, a group of martial artists burst from the bushes.

A towering man with a fearsome face stood at the front of the group, surrounded by hundreds of similarly built men.

The moment Yul Moo-han saw them, his pupils trembled. He recognized them instantly.

“Y-You’re… Gu Yang Soo-mun of the Iron-Blood Tower?”

The Celestial Demon Troupe was composed of the Main Hall, Two Pavilions, Three Halls, Four Towers, and Five Gates.

The Five Gates guarded the Troupe’s borders, while the Four Towers represented its primary martial forces.

The Four Towers were Celestial Demon Troupe’s elite militant groups.

Whenever the Celestial Demon Troupe moved, they moved first.

And now, the Iron-Blood Tower had come to attack Seize Fortress.

“Are you declaring war again?”

“Heh… stating the obvious, aren’t you?”

Gu Yang Soo-mun sneered.

Not just the Iron Blood Tower, the Soul-Severing Tower, Shadowless Tower, and Ninelayers Tower had also received marching orders.

Among them, the Iron Blood Tower’s mission was to attack Seige Fortress.

Yul Mu-han’s face hardened.

“So our scouts have already fallen to you bastards.”

“Ah, those little rats spying on us? Of course we dealt with them.”

“You sons of—!”

Yul Moo-han gritted his teeth, glaring at Gu Yang Soo-mun.

The scouts were like brothers to him. Yet, despite their deaths, he fought to keep his rage in check.

Right now, anger wasn’t what mattered. The priority was informing the Siege Fortress about the Celestial Demon Troupe’s movements.

“Everyone, scatter!”

Whoosh!

In an instant, Yul Moo-han and his men dispersed like locusts.

Their faces showed no shame or guilt.

Survival and delivering the warning were all that mattered. In this moment, the pride of the martial artists meant nothing.

Gu Yang Soo-mun blinked in disbelief at the sudden retreat. Then, with a cruel grin, he threw a hand axe from his waist toward a running figure.

Shreeek!

Yul Moo-han sensed its killing intent and raised his sword to deflect it.

CRACK!

“Guh!”

But the axe shattered his sword and embedded in his chest, flinging him to the ground.

Lying flat on his back, Yul Mu-han gasped for breath.

“Huff… huff…”

He didn’t need to look to know.

Gu Yang Soo-mun’s axe had shattered his ribs.

Even a divine physician couldn’t save him now.

‘But at least… one of us… can warn the Commander…’

Even as his life faded, his thoughts remained fixed on Seize Fortress.

But contrary to his hopes, none of his men escaped.

All had fallen to Gu Yang Soo-mun’s forces.

The area was already under the Iron Blood Tower’s complete control. Breaking through their encirclement was impossible.

“All targets eliminated.”

“Tch.”

At his subordinate’s report, Gu Yang Soo-mun smirked cruelly.

Now, all that remained was the assault on Seige Fortress itself.

He raised his voice in command.

“Move out! Let’s deliver hell to the Jade Heaven Alliance bastards!”

“Waaah!”

The martial artists’ battle cries pierced the heavens.

Seo Jong-myeong’s face turned cold.

Martial artists suddenly surrounded the fortress.

He didn’t even need to confirm it.

“Celestial…Demon Troupe!”

Only the Celestial Demon Troupe would emit this kind of bloodlust.

The warriors were members of the Four Towers.

Though the Iron-Blood Tower had not arrived yet, they would soon.

Seo Jong-myeong scanned the enemy.

Even a rough estimate put their numbers at over two thousand.

That was five times more than the warriors of Seize Fortress.

“Tch. Looks like the Alliance’s intelligence network is completely broken. They moved this many men without being noticed.”

He clicked his tongue.

“This is all because the Alliance Leader pulled out the Heavenly Intelligence Hall operatives for that nonsense operation.”

A subordinate spat in anger.

Not long ago, the Heavenly Intelligence Hall’s agents had been pulled out to disrupt the Hao Clan’s intelligence network.

This left Siege Fortress blind.

Had the Heavenly Intelligence Hall remained, they would have seen this coming.

“Moo-han hasn’t returned means he’s already fallen.”

‘Moo-han…!’

Seo Jong-myeong clenched his fists.

But now was not the time to mourn.

The enemy was advancing.

There had been no declarations of war or negotiations, only pure hostility and bloodlust directed at Siege Fortress.

Seo Jong-myeong let out a dry laugh.

“Well, it’s not like we’re in a position for pleasantries.”

He drew his sword, Bisa. It was the divine artifact of his previous sect, the Diancang Sect.

Srrring!

The blade gleamed coldly under the sky.

Seo Jong-myeong raised it high and roared:

“Do not let a single one of them cross these walls!”

“Waaah!”

The warriors’ battle cries shook the heavens.

At that moment, the Celestial Demon Troupe martial artists charged toward the fortress all at once.

“Let’s go.”

“Kill them all!”

BOOM BOOM BOOM!

Thus began the Battle of Seize Fortress.
