The atmosphere at the Thousand Kingdom School was chaotic.

This was due to the large number of people who had arrived since morning.

“The carriages go this way…”

“Send the carts loaded with provisions to the western warehouse.”

“How many times must I say this? The weapons go to the eastern warehouse. Take them that way.”

The warriors of the Thousand Kingdom School were frantically sorting the incoming supplies at the main gate, sending them to their respective storages.

After the death of its former leader, Namgung Jin-geom, the Thousand Kingdom School had locked its gates and focused all its efforts on reorganizing its structure.

Namgung Jing-geom had been an absolute powerhouse, accounting for over half of Thousand Kingdom School’s combat strength. His absence plunged the sect into a grave crisis.

Therefore, Namgung In, who succeeded Namgung Jin-geom, had to stabilize the system while also immersing himself in martial training to alleviate the anxieties of his family and followers.

Fortunately, his efforts had not been in vain. He had gained considerable insight and achieved a remarkable rise in his martial prowess.

Thanks to this, the unease among the Thousand Kingdom School’s martial artists subsided significantly. However, ominous news arrived once again.

Intelligence indicated that the forces of the Celestial Demon Troupe, which had destroyed the Dragon Heaven Valley, were heading towards the Thousand Kingdom School.

From that moment, the Thousand Kingdom School was on high alert.

They sent urgent letters requesting help in all directions and gathered their forces.

The one who responded was the Myriad Merchants Troupe.

They promised to provide the Thousand Kingdom School with massive support in supplies and personnel, and they actually sent them.

The martial artists of the Thousand Kingdom School were amazed by the endless procession of supplies.

“This is truly incredible. To send such a vast amount of supplies…”

“Indeed. They say the wealth of the Myriad Merchants Troupe reaches the heavens, but it’s astonishing where they even procure such a colossal quantity of supplies.”

“Who cares? What does it matter? Our Association is receiving all these supplies.”

The Thousand Kingdom School was facing a major war.

While the outcome of the war was still unknown, having abundant stockpiles was never a loss. Everyone knew that if the war turned into a prolonged conflict, the side with more reserves held the advantage.

The Thousand Kingdom School planned to exploit the advantages of their terrain and draw out the war. They had evacuated the local residents in advance and prepared for a long-term conflict.

For the Thousand Kingdom School, the enormous supplies sent by the Myriad Merchants Association were like welcome rain during a drought. Consequently, they welcomed the entry of the Myriad Merchants Association’s martial artists with open arms.

The martial artists who transported the supplies decided to remain at the Thousand Kingdom School.

The White Flower Group.

They were an elite force of martial artists created by the Myriad Merchants Association with a massive investment of funds.

The leader of the White Flower Group was Go Muyeong.

He was a master praised by the Myriad Merchants Association, boasting such formidable martial arts that rumors swirled he possessed skills nearing those of the Eight Great Martial Heroes.

Although Go Muyeong was in his early forties, he looked young, barely appearing to be in his mid-to-late thirties.

His flawless white skin without a single wrinkle, distinct features, and sharp eyes gave him a cold impression.

His clothes were impeccably neat, without a single crease, to the point where one might suspect he had obsessive-compulsive tendencies.

A scholar who appeared to be in his late forties approached Go Muyeong.

This refined-looking scholar was Zhuge Hwarong, the Hall Master of the Ten Thousand Swords of the Thousand Kingdom School.

Along with the Cloud Sword Hall, the Ten Thousand Swords Hall was one of the representative martial organizations of the Thousand Kingdom School.

While the Cloud Sword Hall was well-known primarily for its external activities, the Ten Thousand Swords Hall had almost no external presence, so few people knew about it.

Zhuge Hwarong, originally from the Zhuge Family, one of the Five Great Families in the past, led the Ten Thousand Swords Hall with outstanding leadership and sword skills.

Zhuge Hwarong made a fist salute towards Go Muyeong.

“I am Zhuge Hwarong of the Thousand Kingdom School. It is an honor to meet master Go of the Myriad Merchants Troupe.”

“I am Go Muyeong of the Myriad Merchants Troupe. The honor is mine to meet the great hero Zhuge.”

“In these turbulent times, receiving such great help from the Myriad Merchants Association… I don’t know how we can ever repay you.”

“Haha! Isn’t this a matter concerning the Thousand Kingdom School? Of course, our Association must help.”

“Thank you. We will never forget this kindness.”

Zhuge Hwarong repeatedly expressed his gratitude.

“I sincerely hope you never forget that feeling. As you know, our Association is also making a significant effort, and the burden is substantial.”

“Of course. How could one be called human if they forget a kindness? We have prepared a place for you all to rest. Please, come in and relax.”

Zhuge Hwarong personally escorted Go Muyeong and the White Flower Group martial artists to the guest quarters.

The Thousand Kingdom School’s guest quarters were extremely large, capable of accommodating the entire White Flower Group and still having rooms to spare.

The Thousand Kingdom School had handed over the entire guest quarters for the White Flower Group. Thanks to this, Go Muyeong and his group could stay comfortably within the Association without worrying about anyone’s scrutiny.

“Then, please rest comfortably.”

After giving a fist-and-palm salute to Go Muyeong, Zhuge Hwarong withdrew.

Once Zhuge Hwarong disappeared and only the White Flower Group remained, the look in Go Mu-yeong’s eyes changed to a cold one.

“Well, we’ve managed to get inside.”

“Hoo!”

Namgoong In let out a sigh as he opened his eyes.

For an instant, an intense light erupted from his gaze—a ferocious glare that seemed capable of obliterating the soul of anyone who met it. But it was brief, and soon his eyes returned to their usual state.

Vitality overflowed throughout his entire body.

In recent years, his physical condition had never been this good.

It was only a few days ago that he had overcome the enormous wall that had been blocking him. Once he surpassed that wall, a new world became visible, and over the past few days, he had been able to consolidate his realizations and truly make them his own.

Namgung In clenched and unclenched his palm a few times.

Despite the full internal energy he felt in his hand, his expression remained dark.

“Is this really enough to face that man?”

His opponent was a monstrous martial artist who had killed the Alliance Lord of the Jade Heaven Alliance, Ja Hongcheon, and the Lord of Dragon Heaven Valley, Mok Jinmyeong.

No matter how much insight Namgung In had gained or how dramatically his martial prowess had risen, he couldn’t confidently claim victory against such an opponent.

According to intelligence, he was among the Celestial Demon’s forces heading for the Thousand Kingdom School.

Even if they managed to stop the Celestial Demon Troupe’s relentless offensive, if they couldn’t stop ‘Go Geom-wol’, the Thousand Kingdom School stood no chance of victory.

The only master in the Thousand Kingdom School capable of facing Go Geom-wol was Namgung In himself.

The pressure of having to stop Go Geom-wol weighed heavily on his shoulders.

“Hoo!”

Just as he was about to let out another sigh—

“If you keep that up, the ground will cave in.”

A familiar voice spoke as a woman dressed in elegant palace attire entered his residence.

At the woman’s appearance, Namgung In smiled.

“Yeon-hwa, its you.”

The woman was his younger sister, the Snow Sword Flower, Namgung Yeon-hwa.

When Namgung In had been unable to look after the Thousand Kingdom School due to his final training, it was Namgung Yeon-hwa who had rushed about on his behalf.

“Congratulations on achieving the enlightenment.”

“It’s insufficient to call it an enlightenment; my

realizations are still lacking.”

“At your age, the only one who reached such a level was our father. You have every right to be proud of your achievement, brother.”

“Thank you for saying that. But what brings you here at this hour?”

“I came to deliver good news.”

A light sparkled in Namgung In’s eyes.

“Good news? I already heard about the support from the Myriad Merchants Troupe.”

“There’s more good news besides that. It might even be better than that.”

“There is such news?”

“A reply came from the Mad Martial Sect. Master Lee…”

“What did it say?”

Namgung In couldn’t wait and interrupted her. He was that desperate.

Understanding his feelings, Namgung Yeon-hwa didn’t scold him and continued immediately.

“Master Lee says he will personally lead the martial artists of the Mad Martial Sect here.”

“Is the information confirmed?”

“It was conveyed through the Hao Clan. The letter arrived today, so he must have set out a few days ago.”

“Ahh!”

Namgung In unconsciously let out a sigh of relief.

“That’s truly fortunate. The Mad Martial Sect was only established a few years ago, so I didn’t have great expectations, but for Master Lee to come personally… His presence will be a tremendous help.”

“I think so too. With him, we might even be able to face that Go Geom-wol.”

Vitality returned to Namgung In’s eyes.

It felt like discovering a light illuminating the path in pitch-black darkness.

Hope sprouted in his heart again, which had been filled only with despair.

He stood up.

“We must hold out until Master Lee arrives. Fortunately, the martial artists from the Myriad Merchants Troupe have also arrived, so we should be able to hold on sufficiently.”

“Let’s just hang in there a little more, brother.”

“Yes!”

Namgung In grasped his sister’s hand.

Lee Gwak looked around.

The wide main road, which would normally be bustling with people, was completely deserted, not an ant in sight.

This was because people were extremely reluctant to go out after rumors spread that the Celestial Demon Troupe was moving to attack the Thousand Kingdom School.

Unlike when they brought down the Jade Heaven Alliance or the Dragon Heaven Valley, the Celestial Demon Troupe did not hide their movements this time. They were openly displaying their might.

It showed just how high their morale was soaring. It was also an expression of their confidence that no rivals remained for them in the Jianghu.

“They certainly have earned it by now.”

Lee Gwak acknowledged their strength.

Though they had suffered heavy losses in toppling the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Dragon Heaven Valley, with countless casualties, Celestial Demon Troupe did not stop.

Once they had gained momentum, they would never halt until all opposition was crushed.

Thousand Kingdom School, one of the top ten powers in the Jianghu, was too dangerous to leave standing. Better to destroy them now while they still had strength, rather than bleed more later.

Lee Gwak could understand Go Geom-wol’s logic. He would have done the same.

“What are you thinking about so deeply, Brother?”

The giant next to him suddenly spoke.

The giant with an intensely intimidating presence that made one’s knees go weak was none other than Cheol Gwang-woo.

Lee Gwak was heading towards the Thousand Kingdom School, accompanied only by Cheol Gwang-woo.

Just as when the Celestial Demon Troupe dealt with the Jade Heaven Alliance and Dragon Valley, he too had dispersed the Mad Martial Sect’s forces for movement.

The martial artists of the Mad Martial Sect were gathering in small groups of three to five and moving covertly towards the Thousand Kingdom School. Lee Gwak himself, to avoid any potential surveillance by the Celestial Demon Troupe, was heading towards the Thousand Kingdom School with only Cheol Gwang-woo for company.

Perhaps because rumors of the impending war had spread, the road to the Thousand Kingdom School was extremely quiet. The number of people they had met on the way here could be counted on one hand.

Even the inns, which should normally be teeming with people, were desolate enough to hear flies buzzing. Civilians, upon seeing martial men like them, would turn away in fear.

Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang-woo bore no grudge; they knew ordinary people had suffered most in the Celestial Demon Troupe’s wars.

Lee Gwak finally answered.

“Just… many thoughts.”

“Your mind is heavy.”

“It won’t settle easily.”

“You carry too much burden. But you’re not alone anymore.”

The Gwangmu Sect had already surpassed three thousand warriors. Many were outsiders they had accepted, but still, their lives rested on Lee Gwak’s blade.

The weight was immense.

Cheol Gwang-woo shook his head.

I will never become a sect leader. After this chaos, I’ll just open a little inn with Yei-n and live in peace.

He and Bang Yein had promised to build a quiet life together, away from the endless strife of the Jianghu.

He hid his own weariness, knowing Lee Gwak bore far heavier burdens. Until this calamity ended, he wanted to support him.

The two rode in silence, each lost in thought.

“Hmm.”

A low sound slipped from Yi Gwak’s lips.

“What is it, Brother?”

“It seems not everyone welcomes our arrival at the Thousand Kingdom School.”

“What?”

Suspicion flashed in Cheol Gwang-woo’s eyes—then his face twisted viciously.

“They dare…”

Hundreds of hostile presences gathered around them.

Soon, they revealed themselves, blocking the path in a human wall.

All radiated dangerous auras.

Among them, Lee Gwak recognized a familiar face.

“Fairy Lee!”

Standing straight, fixing him with her gaze, was the beautiful Oh Cho-hye of the Celestial Moon Palace.

Not only her, but Gu Yeon-su the Third Fairy, Cho Yu-seon the Sixth fairy, and all the other fairies of the palace were present.

Lee Gwak frowned. His movements had been secret—how had they known to intercept him?

As if answering his doubt, Oh Cho-hye spoke:

“The saintess said you would surely pass this way. She told us to wait.”

Gu Mun-hye possessed the ability to glimpse into the near future. Thanks to this, she had foreseen Lee Gwak’s involvement in advance.

She added:

— If Master Lee joins the battlefield, it will bring great disaster upon our sect. We must stop him beforehand, or at least delay his arrival as much as possible.

The Fairies knew well how dangerous it was to oppose someone like Lee Gwak. Yet for Gu Mun-hye and the Celestial Demon Troupe, they were ready to lay down their lives at any moment. And today was the day to prove it.
