So Gun-myeong’s white eyes turned to Lim Sobo.

“Young Strategist! A strategist abandoning the fortress without permission is dereliction of duty. Let’s go back while I’m still being polite.”

At that moment, Lim So-bo felt like a snake crawling all over her body.

Even when she was in the Sky High Castle, So Gun-myeong had always looked at her with the same gaze. Although there was no trace of emotion in his snow-white eyes, Lim So-bo instinctively felt the contempt in them.

In truth, So Gun-myeong had been the one who had opposed her the most at the Sky High Castle. He resented her authority and worked tirelessly to minimize her influence.

She knew it, but she put up with it for the greater good.

She thought that if she alone endured the humiliation, everything would improve. However, that was her misconception.

She should not have bowed her head just because she was young.

She should not have endured when they took away her authority.

If she showed weakness, they would only try to take more—such was the nature of the Green Forest.

In the end, the Green Forest was nothing more than a gathering of bandits, and the Sky High Castle was their stronghold.

During her time there, Lim Sobo had come to understand this deeply.

Human nature does not change easily.

Lim So-bo sighed and spoke,

“Hah! Young Master So. I’m no longer a member of the Sky High Castle. I’ve already left a letter resigning from my position as the military strategist.”

“Do you think the Sky High Castle is a place you can come and go as you please? I never took you for someone so irresponsible.”

“That’s why I’m resigning. I lack the capability.”

“Do you really think it’s that simple?”

So Gun-myeong’s eyes flickered, and his tone changed. Lim So-bo’s refusal made him show his true face.

Despite the menacing look in his eyes, Lim So-bo did not back down.

“I have no further relations with the Sky High Castle. So please do not oppress me anymore.”

“You dare to defy my words?”

The corner of So Gun-myeong’s eyes twitched.

“The term ‘dare’ is not something someone like you can use. You are far from qualified.”

He hadn’t expected Lim So-bo to stand her ground so firmly.

“I don’t know what gives you the confidence to act so boldly. Do you think you can live in peace after falling out of favor with the Sky High Castle?”

‘’It doesn’t matter what you say, I’ve already made up my mind.”

“It doesn’t matter what threats you make. I’ve already made up my mind.”

So Gun-myeong frowned.

None of his words were getting through to her at all.

Even the authority of the young master of Sky High Castle had been cast aside.

Killing intent flickered in his snake-like eyes.

“If you insist on refusing kindness and choosing punishment, then so be it…”

At his signal, the martial artists surrounding the inn began to move.

Just then—

Lee Gwak silently stepped in front of Lim So-bo.

Seo Gun-myeong’s eyebrows twitched.

“And who are you?”

They had crossed paths once before, but So Gun-myeong did not remember him. Back then, Lee Gwak had only been a squad leader in the outer hall of the Jade Heaven Alliance, and they had merely brushed past each other.

It made sense that So Gun-myeong wouldn’t recognize him.

“Lee Gwak.”

“What?”

“I am Lee Gwak.”

Instead of using the alias, Lee Gwak revealed his true name.

Until now, he had been using an alias to avoid unnecessary trouble. But now that he had decided to take Lim Sobo under his wing, he could no longer afford to be indecisive.

“Lee Gwak? The Sura Blade?”

Seo Gun-myeong bit his lip.

An unexpected figure had appeared.

Lee Gwak was a figure who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the leaders of the Seven Sects.

Though So Gun-myeong’s reputation was formidable in his own right, he was still far inferior to Lee Gwak.

Just the list of martial artists who had fallen to Lee Gwak’s blade was enough to render any comparison meaningless.

For a moment, So Gun Myeong’s expression twisted, but he quickly regained his composure and clasped his hands in a respectful salute.

“I am So Gun Myeong, Young Master of the Sky High Castle. My apologies for failing to recognize such a renowned figure of the Jianghu.”

“No need.”

“But what brings you here?”

So Gun Myeong’s gaze flickered between Lee Gwak and Lim Sobo. His instincts told him the two were connected—and his instincts were not wrong.

“I’ve come to take Sobo with me.”

“She is Sky High Castle’s military strategist.”

“As far as I know, Sobo has already expressed her intention to resign.”

“The Sky High Castle has not accepted her resignation yet.”

So Gun Myeong raised his voice.

Even he knew his argument was forced.

From the moment their spy, Cheol Ryeong, had been discovered and eliminated, the relationship between Lim Sobo and the Sky High Castle had been irreparably damaged.

Letting her go now might have been the better choice for the future. But he couldn’t.

Pride wouldn’t allow it.

The Sky High Castle was one of the Seven Sects. If word spread that they had meekly surrendered their military strategist, their reputation would be ruined. They would never again be able to hold their heads high in the Jianghu.

Their reputation had already taken a serious hit when the lord of Sky High Castle, Po Cheon-wol, was injured by Jinghae. If their reputation fell any further, the Sky High Castle risked being pushed out of the Seven Sects entirely.

“If you withdraw now, I’ll let this matter rest. But if you persist in this stubbornness, you will make an enemy of the Sky High Castle. Think carefully.”

So Gun-myeong’s words were an outright threat.

This was the territory of Sky High Castle. Whatever happened here would never reach the outside world. And even if it did, it wouldn’t matter. He was confident that he could handle the consequences.

So Gun-myeong stared coldly at Lee Gwak. But contrary to his expectations, Lee Gwak’s expression remained calm.

His attitude, as calm as the surface of a lake, grated on So Gun-myeong’s nerves.

Just as So Gun-myeong was about to speak again, Lee Gwak beat him to it.

“Whatever you say, it doesn’t matter. Today, I will take Sobo with me.”

“Are you truly determined to make an enemy of the Sky High Castle?”

“From what I know, the first Lord of Sky High Castle, Muk Il-gwang, established it to oppose the Demonic Cult. Though he walked the path of the Green Forest, he was said to be full of chivalry and righteousness. Seeing his descendants corrupt the Sky High Castle with personal greed—he’s likely shedding tears of blood in the afterlife.”

“Enough!”

So Gun-myeong cut him off.

His previously pale eyes were now bloodshot.

Lee Gwak’s words had struck a nerve.

“How dare you insult the Sky High Castle! This is unforgivable. Everyone, subdue this man and bring the military strategist back!”

“As you command!”

At So Gun-myeong’s order, the martial artists accompanying him rushed towards Lee Gwak.

They were the elites of Sky High Castle.

Plucked from the six major strongholds, they’d undergone long years of intense training.

Of these, the seven most skilled were known as the “Green Forest Seven,” and the elite force they led was called the Heavenly Wind Corps.

The Green Forest Seven and the Heavenly Wind Corps pressed in on Lee Gwak.

“So he’s called the Surablade? Hmph, what of it?”

“Once we subdue him, our Heavenly Wind Corps will become legendary.”

A light of greed flickered in their eyes.

Despite living by theft and violence, they were still human—craving fame was in their nature.

They believed that capturing Lee Gwak would bring them great renown. Their ambition blinded them.

Boom!

Just then, a massive figure stepped in next to Lee Gwak with a thunderous thud.

A man with a bear-like build and a fierce expression—Cheol Gwang-woo.

“No one touches sworn brother without my permission.”

Zzzzzzt—!

A terrifying aura erupted from his entire body.

The madness he had kept sealed until now.

The berserk energy surged like a tidal wave, dominating the area.

The front ranks of the Heavenly Wind Corps turned pale at this terrifying energy, they were encountering for the first time.

But Cheol Gwang-woo wasn’t the only one they had to face.

Cheon Wol quietly took his place beside Cheol Gwang-woo.

Shing!

He drew his sword.

Though he said nothing, his resolve was communicated clearly to the Heavenly Wind Corps and the Green Forest Seven.

He had endured, again and again, for Lim So-bo’s sake.

Because Lim So-bo had endured it, he had chosen to do so as well, thinking it would be best for her. But not anymore.

He realized that to truly help Lim So-bo, he had to break the shackles that bound her ankles.

The shackles known as the Sky High Castle…

That iron resolve from Cheol Gwang-woo and Cheon Wol reached Lee Gwak as well.

Lee Gwak smiled.

He was not alone.

No matter how thorny the road ahead might be, he had nothing to fear with them by his side.

“Charge!”

“Waaah!”

The Heavenly Wind Corps charged in unison.

“Hyah!”

In that instant, Cheol Gwang-woo kicked off the ground.

A colossal bear had slammed into the front line of the Heavenly Wind Corps.

Boom!

“Gahk!”

“Aagh!”

With a thunderous crash, over a dozen martial artists were battered into bloody pulp and flung aside.

Having mastered the Vajra Demon Shadow Technique, Cheol Gwang-u’s body was harder than iron. His sheer bulk and weight alone were enough to make him a fearsome living weapon.

While Cheol Gwang-woo rampaged like a berserk bear, Cheon Wol moved with silent grace.

Shiiing!

Each stroke of his sword claimed a life.

Together, Cheol Gwang-woo and Cheon Wol unleashed devastating power.

“Stop them!”

“Urgh!”

They were like lions tearing through a flock of sheep.

The Green Forest Seven and the Heavenly Wind Corps did everything they could, but it was no use.

Cheol Gwang-woo and Cheon Wol carved open a path.

Lee Gwak followed that path.

At its end stood So Gun-myeong.

His face, which had never shown emotion before, was contorted like a demon.

He saw Lee Gwak approaching him.

That calm, unperturbed expression – as if nothing had happened – infuriated him.

No martial artist had ever dared to wear such a look in his presence.

“You rootless nobody…!”

He refused to acknowledge Lee Gwak.

No matter how fierce Lee Gwak’s reputation was, he was still just a wandering martial artist with no backing.

Meanwhile, So Gun-myeong was the rightful heir of Sky High Castle, a renowned sect of the Jianghu.

Their statuses were incomparable.

He had heard that Lee Gwak had killed Yong Cheong Myeong.

Yong Cheong Myeong had been someone even hefound troublesome. But that didn’t mean he feared him.

It was only the Jade Heaven Alliance behind Yong Cheon Myeong that concerned him. In a pure martial contest, he was confident he could defeat Yong Cheon Myeong.

‘Good. If I defeat this man here, my reputation will shake the heavens!’

Greed flickered in his eyes.

Crisis and opportunity came hand in hand.

Now was that moment.

So Gun-myeong channeled his internal energy, and his hands turned crimson.

Crimson Blood Hands.

A palm technique said to rival the Demonic Sect’s White Jade Hands in destructive power.

It was the very skill that had earned him the nickname White-Eyed Blood Hand.

So Gun-myeong rushed towards Lee Gwak, unleashing his Crimson Blood Hands.

Kwaarrr!

An overwhelming force swept toward Lee Gwak like a tidal wave.

Sssht!

Just then, a single sharp ring cut across the battlefield.

Lee Gwak drew his blade.

Like a shooting star, Star Soul slashed through the Crimson Blood Hand’s raging current.

“Ugh!”

So Gun-myeong’s eyes wavered. He hastily performed the nine defensive moves of the Crimson Blood Hand and shielded himself.

Claang!

The metallic crash was deafening, and So Gun-myeong’s body was knocked backward.

His right palm was split open to the bone, blood gushing freely.

A look of disbelief crossed his face.

His hands, tempered by the Crimson Blood Hands, were as hard as diamond—yet they couldn’t withstand a single strike from Lee Gwak.

Shiiiing!

In that instant, Lee Gwak’s second strike came.

A simple thrust—but the momentum and killing intent behind it defied imagination.

So Gun-myeong felt a chill crawl up his spine.

He hastily executed the Crimson Blood Hands’ ultimate technique—Raging-Winds Fist.

The power contained in this move was incomparable to anything before.

BOOOM—!

His plan was to end this in a single decisive exchange.

In that moment, Lee Gwak crouched low and kicked off from the ground.

Bzzzzt!

A bizarre noise reverberated through the battlefield.

Lee Gwak’s Revolving Steps fused with the Heaven Killing Blade.

Like a swallow skimming over water, his form glided forward, close to the ground.

Swiish!

The Star Soul thrust forward in a straight line.

Connecting one point to another, a single line.

And at the line’s end stood So Gun-myeong.

Splurt!

Blood sprayed from So Gun-myeong’s shoulder.

WHIRL—!

Lee Gwak pivoted on his left foot.

The Star Soul followed, spinning with him.

So Gun-myeong felt as if a tornado in the shape of a dragon had appeared in front of his eyes.

“Guaaaah!”

Surrounded by this whirling force, So Gun-myeong let out a scream.
