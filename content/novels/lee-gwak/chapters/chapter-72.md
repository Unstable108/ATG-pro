Manhwa: Chapter 63

Lee Gwak and Squad 13 were exempted from Outer Hall duties from the moment they were assigned to the expedition under Lim Sobo. Thanks to this, Lee Gwak and his squad members had a more relaxed schedule.

Lee Gwak left his house early in the morning.

He needed to gather and prepare his personal supplies.

His destination was the Yin Family Weapon House, located on the outskirts of the outer city. It was the very place where he had acquired his current sword.

As he entered the Yin Family Weapon House, the merchant recognized him.

“Long time no see.”

“Yes, it has been a while.”

“Don’t tell me your sword broke again?”

“The sword is still perfectly fine.”

“That’s a relief! If it had broken again, I would have started doubting the reliability of the weapons produced by our shop.”

Lee Gwak smiled at the merchant’s joke.

“You flatter me.”

“So, what are you here to buy today? Your sword is still in good condition, isn’t it?”

“I’m setting out on a long journey this time, so I came to gather some necessary supplies.”

“It sounds like you don’t have anything specific in mind.”

“Yes! I plan to look around and decide.”

Hearing Lee Gwak’s answer, the merchant nodded.

“Then take your time browsing. Ah! Before that, may I offer you a piece of advice?”

“I’d appreciate that.”

“In my experience, when you’re going on a long journey, it’s a good idea to carry a small knife or a hand axe. The longer the journey, the more likely you’ll have to camp outdoors, and that naturally means doing various small tasks—cutting branches, preparing food, and so on. Using that large sword of yours for such chores would be incredibly inefficient. So, having a small knife or hand axe will come in handy.”

“That’s all the advice I have for you. Now, take your time looking around.”

With those words, the merchant stepped aside. It was so that Lee Gwak could look around freely.

Left alone, Lee Gwak slowly examined the weapon shop.

Countless weapons were displayed on the racks.

Swords, blades, spears, axes, and more…

Lee Gwak carefully examined all the weapons on display.

As he had noticed before, the weapons sold by the Yin Family Weapon House were of very high quality. Though they weren’t masterpieces made by famous craftsmen, it was still rare to find mass-produced weapons of such high caliber.

For this reason, rather than focusing on the quality of the weapons, Lee Gwak prioritized their practicality.

As the merchant had advised, he needed a small knife or an axe. Scanning the display, he selected a dagger and a small hand axe.

The dagger was only about the size of an adult’s palm, making it easy to store and carry. The blade was sharp enough to have countless practical uses.

Although he had initially chosen the dagger, he found it difficult to pass up the hand axe. It was about the size of a child’s forearm, lightweight, and well-balanced. It seemed just as versatile as the dagger.

After a brief moment of contemplation, Lee Gwak decided to purchase both the dagger and the hand axe.

Since he was embarking on a long journey, he had no idea what might happen along the way, and thorough preparation was always the best course of action.

Just then, his eyes caught sight of an unusual item.

Steel needles, each about the size of an adult’s finger. Though much thinner than a child’s finger, they appeared exceptionally sharp. There were dozens of them laid out in a bundle.

‘These could be useful for traps or mechanisms.’

Instantly, more than a dozen uses for the steel needles flashed through Lee Gwak’s mind.

It wasn’t something he needed right away, but seeing such quality materials sparked his desire to have them. In the end, Lee Gwak purchased the dagger, hand axe, and steel needles.

The merchant tilted his head in curiosity.

“The dagger and hand axe, I understand, but why the steel needles? They’re not particularly useful.”

“I was just drawn to them.”

“You have strange tastes, buying such useless things.”

“Then why did you make them?”

“Hoo! There’s someone in my family who enjoys making all sorts of things. Sometimes they create remarkable items, but most of the time, they churn out these useless trinkets. Selling them cheaply is more profitable than melting them down and remaking them, so we put them up for sale.”

The merchant let out a deep sigh.

Whoever had made the steel needles must have been quite a headache for him.

But that had nothing to do with Lee Gwak. While the merchant might see the needles as useless, Lee Gwak saw endless potential in them.

After paying for his items, he left the Yin Family Weapon House.

His next destination was a clothing shop in the marketplace.

Inside, there was an array of garments, from flowing silk robes to lightweight battle attire. However, Lee Gwak bypassed the finer clothing and selected a brown leather cloak instead.

The loose-fitting cloak was perfect for shielding against wind and rain, a necessity for someone traveling as far as Lee Gwak.

Just then, another item caught his attention. It was a leather belt.

Unlike an ordinary belt, this one was significantly wider and designed with multiple compartments, ideal for storing a dagger and various small tools.

Lee Gwak fastened the leather belt around his waist and carefully placed the dagger and hand axe he had bought from Yin Family Weapon House into their slots.

“Perfect.”

It was as if the belt had been designed precisely for that purpose as the weapons fit flawlessly. He then tucked the steel needles into the small leather pouch attached to the back of the belt, completing the arrangement perfectly.

Feeling satisfied, he put on the leather cloak as well.

It fit as if it had been custom-made for him, wrapping comfortably around his body.

A pleased smile appeared on his lips. After paying the shopkeeper, he stepped outside.

Having spent the entire morning making his rounds, he realized that noon had already passed.

He grabbed a quick meal from a street vendor and continued shopping for a few more necessary supplies. By the time he returned home, his hands were full, and the sun was setting.

Lee Gwak laid out his purchases on the wooden platform.

There was the dagger, hand axe, leather belt, steel needles, as well as a leather pouch, a bundle of rope, and a water flask. It was a fairly diverse collection of items.

He had spent nearly two months’ worth of his salary on these supplies. His pockets were now empty, but he had no regrets.

Even if some of these things seemed unnecessary at the moment, he was confident they would serve a purpose one day.

As Lee Gwak glanced around the interior of the house, a thought crossed his mind.

Since he would be away for quite a while, he felt a bit concerned about leaving his home unattended. He briefly considered setting up some trap mechanisms before his departure, but he ultimately decided against it.

There was always a chance that Han Socheon might visit while he was away. He didn’t want to risk scaring her with unnecessary traps.

‘Socheon…’

At the thought of Han Socheon, Lee Gwak’s gaze darkened.

Right now, she was most likely carrying out assassination missions on the front lines.

Lee Gwak knew firsthand how deeply killing another human being could corrode one’s spirit and mind as he had experienced it himself when he killed the Dark Cloud Reaper. That was why he couldn’t help but worry about her.

Thinking about Han Socheon, a heavy sigh escaped his lips.

Countless emotions were tangled within that breath.

Each member of Squad 13, including Lee Gwak, was provided with a horse.

Normally, Outer Hall warriors were not given horses, but this time was an exception.

Woon Dae-yeon, Lim Sobo, and others rode horses, so it didn’t make sense that Lee Gwak and the rest of his squad members, who were to accompany them, would walk instead of riding.

Lee Gwak, Seok Yi-cheon, and Ki Jinhwi adapted quickly to riding, but the rest struggled at first. They spent every moment before departure practicing horseback riding until they were finally able to manage.

At last, the day of their departure from the Jade Heaven Alliance arrived.

Lee Gwak and the rest of Squad 13 members led their respective horses to the designated meeting point.

Even the seasoned Seok Yi-Cheon and Ki Jinhwi’s faces showed visible signs of tension. Traveling far beyond the Jade Heaven Alliance was daunting, even for them.

The other squad members were even more on edge. Their eyes darted restlessly, a clear sign of their anxiety.

Lee Gwak turned to Seok Yi-cheon.

“You made sure to bring the liquor, right?”

“You didn’t forget it, did you?”

“Of course not.”

At the mention of liquor, Seok Yi-cheon suddenly grinned, as if he’d never been nervous in the first place. He motioned toward his horse, where several bottles of alcohol were strapped to the saddle.

“Good thinking.”

“Nothing beats liquor when you’re camping out in the wilderness. The others brought some too, so we won’t run out.”

Hearing this, the rest of the squad members smiled.

The nervousness on their faces had finally disappeared.

“Looks like everyone’s here.”

Lim Sobo appeared, her back to Woon Dae-yeon and three seemingly ordinary martial artists. They were the bodyguards who would accompany Woon Dae-yeon.

The moment Lee Gwak saw them, he immediately recognized their identities. He had seen them before.

‘Bloodcloaked Death God Battalion.’

They were the elite forces directly under the Alliance Leader’s command and they had first appeared during the Lunatic Pugilist’s hunt. Although they had failed in their hunt for the Lunatic Pugilist, and their leader, Yuk Hyeon, had also lost his life, their formidable skills had left a lasting impression on Lee Gwak.

Now, they were disguised in plain clothes rather than their signature blood-red robes, but Lee Gwak still remembered their faces vividly.

Lee Gwak was now sure. Woon Dae-yeon and his group were on an important mission.

The Bloodcloaked Death God Battalion never acted independently. Their presence meant the Alliance Leader himself had authorized this mission. That meant this was no ordinary task.

The warriors of the Bloodcloaked Death God Battalion spoke to each other in low voices. They seemed relaxed, almost disorderly, but their eyes gleamed with razor-sharp focus.

Woon Dae-yeon approached Lee Gwak.

“Have you made all the necessary preparations?”

“Then let’s depart immediately. Squad Leader Lee, don’t worry about me. Just focus all your attention on Sobo.”

“Understood.”

“Then, let’s go.”

Without waiting for a response, Woon Dae-yeon mounted his horse. Following his lead, the Bloodcloaked Death God Battalion mounted their horses in unison.

They rode out first, with Lee Gwak and Squad 13 following closely behind.

At that moment, Lim Sobo, who had been riding alongside Woon Dae-yeon, gradually slowed down until she was riding next to Cheon-wol.

“You’ve covered your face again.”

Without thinking, Cheon-wol apologized at Lim Sobo’s remark. Seeing this, she gave him a playful smile.

“No, this time it’s fine. Keep your face wrapped up like that. If we pass by any women on the road and they fall for your face, it would be a problem.”

Hearing her teasing words, Cheon-wol blushed slightly. However, since his face was completely covered with cloth, Lim Sobo couldn’t see it.

Next, Lim Sobo spurred her horse forward and moved alongside Lee Gwak.

“Thank you, big brother. For agreeing to come with us so readily.”

“It’s nothing. But… isn’t it about time you told us where exactly we’re going?”

“That’s actually why I came over. Our destination is the Ten Thousand Merchant Union.”

“Ten Thousand Merchant Union?”

Lee Gwak’s eyes lit up with recognition.

The Ten Thousand Merchant Union was one of the Ten Supremes. As its name suggested, it was an organization formed by merchants from all over the world, ruling over a significant portion of the Jianghu through its immense wealth.

For the past century, the Ten Thousand Merchant Union had invested unimaginable amounts of money to build its own military power. They had purchased rare martial arts manuals from all corners of the martial world, recruited famous warriors for astronomical sums, and nurtured their own experts with lavish funding.

At first, the martial artists of Jianghu laughed at the Ten Thousand Merchant Union.

They believed that true martial prowess could not be bought with money.

The pride of a martial artist was so great that it could never be swayed by mere gold. That waas what Jianghu thought.

But the Ten Thousand Merchant Union shattered those prejudices. They recruited the greatest masters by offering them sums beyond imagination, funding their training, and supporting them with invaluable martial arts manuals and rare elixirs.

As a result, these experts grew even stronger and ultimately pledged their loyalty to the Ten Thousand Merchant Union.

A kingdom built on gold.

That was what the Jianghu called them.

Even in the Jianghu, which revolved around the Jade Heaven Alliance, the Ten Thousand Merchant Union was able to maintain its independence for that very reason.

“Why are we going there?”

“There’s only one reason why a warrior seeks out the Ten Thousand Merchant Union.”

“It’s to beg for money. The Jade Heaven Alliance needs money. A lot of it.”

Lim Sobo grinned.
