“Enemies have closed in within a hundred li.”

“The scouts we sent have all been annihilated.”

“They’ve set up camp.”

A flood of urgent messages arrived via messenger hawk, and Namgung In furrowed his brow deeply.

None of the news he heard was hopeful.

The scouts sent out to ascertain the enemy’s movements had all been wiped out, and the Celestial Demon Troupe was building a military formation not far from the Thousand Kingdom School.

This meant that they weren’t planning a short skirmish but rather a full-scale war intended to utterly crush them.

“The only consolation is that thanks to the Myriad Merchant Troupe’s support, we won’t have supply problems even in a prolonged war.”

The Thousand Kingdom School’s warehouses were filled with supplies sent by the Myriad Merchant Troupe. It was an enormous amount, enough to hold out for over a year even without any external support.

Because of this, despite facing Celestial Demon Troupe’s major offensive, there was no chaos within the Thousand Kingdom School. They steadily prepared for war without wavering.

The civilians who had been around the Thousand Kingdom School had already been moved to safety, and mechanisms along with defensive formations were installed at key points.

He couldn’t be confident that this level of defense would be enough to stop the Celestial Demon Troupe, but they had done their best to prepare for war nonetheless.

Even at that moment, the martial artists of the Thousand Kingdom School were preparing for the bloody storm about to descend upon them.

The only glimmer of hope was that after the Mad Martial Sect declared its participation, several other sects expressed their intention to send reinforcements.

But Namgung In was not disappointed.

These were sects that hadn’t budged until the Mad Martial Sect made its stance clear. The fact that they were now moving held deep significance.

“The floodgate’s been opened.”

Even the sects currently hesitating to move, watching the Celestial Demon Troupe and the situation, would not remain idle once they saw allies stepping forward.

After all, if Thousand Kingdom School fell, they would be next.

The most vulnerable was Sky High Castle.

For now, the Thousand Kingdom School served as a breakwater. But if it collapsed, Sky High Castle would be hit head-on by Celestial Demon Troupe’s tidal wave.

Namgung In therefore predicted that the Sky High Castle would soon act. But he also knew the Celestial Demon Troupe would foresee this. Which meant they would try to destroy the Thousand Kingdom School quickly before the Sky High Castle could intervene.

“We hold out. No matter what, until the Mad Martial Sect and the other sects’ reinforcements arrive, we endure.”

Namgung In muttered to himself, clenching his fist tightly.

As he opened the door and stepped outside, he saw numerous martial artists moving busily.

The martial artists with weapons at their waists didn’t even notice Namgung In had come out, each performing their assigned roles.

Namgung In also had no intention of blaming them for not paying him attention.

Just then, a martial artist approached Namgung In.

Unlike most martial artists who wore plain martial attire, he was wearing noticeably splendid robes.

It was none other than Go Moo-young, the leader of the White Flower Group, who sent for support from the Myriad Merchant Troupe.

Go Moo-young spoke to Namgung In.

“Have you come out, Association Leader Namgung?”

“Ah! Unit Leader Go.”

“I heard the enemies have reached our very doorstep.”

“That’s correct. The enemies have already entered within a hundred li and are building a military formation.”

“A bloody wind will blow soon.”

Namgung In clenched his fist as he muttered.

“I wish we could avoid it, but unfortunately, that seems impossible. Still, I can’t tell you how reassuring it is to have the Myriad Merchant Troupe’s support.”

“Aren’t we longtime allies? When you think about it, both the Thousand Kingdom School and Myriad Merchant Troupe are practically one family, connected by ties from a hundred years ago with the Fist Demon.”

“I’m just grateful you think that way.”

“Haha! Don’t worry. Our Myriad Merchant Troupe will continue to support the Thousand Kingdom School.”

“Right! Where is the esteemed Leader of your Alliance?”

“Why are you looking for our Leader?”

Go Moo-young looked at Namgung In with a puzzled expression.

“I wished to see him in person and offer my thanks. As you know, I’ve had a connection with Leader Eun since we were young.”

As fellow successors of the Ten Sects, Namgung In had interactions with Eun Il-myeong, who had now become the Myriad Merchant Troupe’s leader.

Back then, they were all successors, but now that they had both ascended to the position of leader, he wanted to meet again and formally establish their friendship.

Go Moo-young smiled and said.

“As it happens, our Leader also mentioned wanting to meet you soon, Sect Leader.”

“Is that so?”

“Once we overcome this crisis, the Leader will come to see you.”

“Could we meet any sooner?”

“My apologies. That is something I cannot answer…”

“No, it seems I was too impatient.”

Just as Namgung In was apologizing to Go Moo-young.

“Sect Leader!”

A martial artist came running up urgently.

From his frantic expression, Namgung In sensed something unusual had happened.

“What is it?”

“The Celestial Demon Troupe is attacking the first defensive line!”

“What? Didn’t they say they were setting up a formation right now?”

“That was a deception.”

“How can this be!”

Namgung In was shocked. It was because he had been somewhat complacent due to the information that the enemies were building a formation.

“Who is at the defensive line?”

“Lady Yeonhwa is commanding.”

“Yeonhwa?”

Namgung In sighed in relief. He immediately gathered troops and rushed toward the first line of defense.

The line was built in a village thirty li south of the Thousand Kingdom School. Though it appeared ordinary at first glance, it had been strategically prepared with mechanisms and traps.

When they arrived, the ground was littered with corpses—most of them were Celestial Demon Martial artists.

The traps and mechanisms had taken a heavy toll. But their numbers soon overwhelmed the defenses, and the Thousand Kingdom School’s martial artists had to engage directly.

The battle was fierce, warriors clashing in a bloody scuffle.

Amid them all, one woman stood out.

“Concentrate our strength here!”

Even while locked in combat herself, she commanded others effectively. She was Namgung Yeon-hwa, Namgung In’s younger sister.

A woman who physically clashed and fought the Celestial Demon Troupe martial artists herself while simultaneously commanding the Thousand Kingdom School martial artists with her words. It was none other than Namgung In’s younger sister, Namgung Yeon-hwa.

Namgung Yeon-hwa was fighting fiercely against a large-framed Celestial Demon Troupe martial artist. Her opponent wielded a bizarre giant blade; each swing of the blade unleashed a storm-like energy that swept violently in all directions.

This martial artist was famous even within the Celestial Demon Troupe for his overwhelmingly domineering style. Indeed, his martial arts were purely domineering, boasting formidable power.

Despite her slender frame, Namgung Yeon-hwa effectively blocked the domineering onslaught. Moreover, she directed the martial artists nearby to efficiently counter the Celestial Demon Troupe’s offensive.

Her skill was extraordinary.

Encouraged by Namgung Yeon-hwa’s strong performance, the Thousand Kingdom School’s martial artists were barely holding back the Celestial Demon Troupe’s relentless attacks.

“A mere girl—impressive.”

Even her direct opponent, exchanging blows with her, marveled at Namgung Yeon-hwa’s ability.

Inspired by his sister’s strong fight, Namgung In felt his courage surge and shouted.

“Let’s drive the Celestial Demon Troupe out of our home!”

“Waaa!”

The warriors of the Thousand-Kingdom School, who had joined the defensive line too late, roared and joined the fray.

With the addition of the forces led by Namgung In, the tide of battle turned in favor of the Thousand Kingdom School.

“Keuk!”

“Dammit! Retreat!”

Finally, unable to endure any longer, the Celestial Demon Troupe decided to retreat.

At the retreat order, the Celestial Demon Troupe martial artists, who had been attacking fervently, withdrew from the battlefield like a receding tide.

“Pursue them!”

“Don’t let a single one escape!”

The morale of the Thousand Kingdom School martial artists soared. They tried to chase after the retreating Celestial Demon Troupe martial artists. But at that moment, Namgung In gave an order.

“Everyone, stop the pursuit.”

A look of disappointment flashed across the faces of the Thousand Kingdom School martial artists.

It seemed like they could deal a significant blow to the Celestial Demon Troupe if they capitalized on this momentum. But as their excitement cooled, they could clearly see the enemy’s movements.

Astonishingly, the Celestial Demon Troupe martial artists retreated without their ranks breaking at all. There was no sign of defeat anywhere to be seen.

They showed composure, even retrieving their comrades’ corpses as they withdrew. If the Thousand Kingdom School martial artists had given chase, they would likely have fallen into a counterattack instead.

The Thousand Kingdom School martial artists felt the blood throughout their bodies run cold.

“Those bastards!”

They stood in place and blankly watched the Celestial Demon Troupe martial artists retreat.

“Phew!”

Only then did Namgung In let out a sigh of relief.

He had narrowly averted a situation where they would have suffered heavy losses by foolishly losing reason and giving chase.

“Brother!”

Namgung Yeon-hwa approached him.

A smile touched Namgung In’s lips. He was proud of Namgung Yeonhwa, who had excellently blocked the Celestial Demon Troupe’s invasion under difficult circumstances. But the smile on his lips quickly vanished.

Because he suddenly felt someone’s gaze.

His temples throbbed, and the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end.

His instincts were warning him of danger.

Without realizing it, Namgung In looked towards where he felt the gaze coming from.

It was in the direction where the Celestial Demon Troupe martial artists were retreating.

Overwhelmed by the intense gaze that seemed to ignore the distance, Namgung In unconsciously clenched his fist tightly.

No one told him who the owner of that gaze was. But he almost instinctively realized who was sending such an intense stare.

There was only one martial artist who could make his presence felt so acutely across such a vast distance, where recognizing each other’s forms was impossible.

‘The Celestial Demon Troupe Leader.’

The man who was driving the entire Jianghu into a storm.

The martial artist who devoured the master who raised him and ascended to the position of supremacy himself.

The violent wind he brought was shaking not only the Jianghu but also threatening the Thousand Kingdom School.

Namgung In glared fiercely towards Go Geom-wol, gritting his teeth.

At some point, the oppressive pressure weighing him down disappeared. Go Geom-wol had withdrawn his gaze first. Still, Namgung In couldn’t move.

His entire body was already drenched in sweat.

He had expended an enormous amount of mental energy in that short time. That’s how intense Go Geom-wol’s gaze was.

‘Can I really handle him?’

The thought suddenly crossed his mind.

Frankly, he lacked confidence.

He wasn’t someone easily intimidated by anyone, but he had no confidence he could handle Go Geom-wol.

Lee Gwak looked ahead with deeply sunken eyes.

Where his gaze was directed, a woman stood precariously, leaning on a single spear.

The woman was Oh Cho-hye, the second of the Moon Shadow Six Fairies.

Her weapon, the Ribbon, was torn to shreds, its traces nowhere to be found. It had been mercilessly ripped apart by Lee Gwak’s blade.

Having lost her Ribbon, Oh Cho-hye picked up someone’s spear that was rolling on the ground to oppose Lee Gwak.

Although she favored the Ribbon, the distinction of weapons held no meaning for a martial artist who had reached her level.

Even wielding an unfamiliar weapon like the spear, she displayed extreme martial prowess. But her dazzling spear techniques were ineffective against Lee Gwak.

Eventually, the spearhead was severed by Lee Gwak’s blade, and she too suffered a major wound.

Her abdomen was slashed open lengthwise, blood pouring out like a waterfall. She pressed on the wound with her left hand, but blood persistently oozed out between her fingers.

Oh Cho-hye finally gave up on stopping the bleeding and looked around.

Everyone was dead.

The martial artists of the Celestial Lunar Palace.

Her sisters, the Moon Shadow Six Fairies.

Except for the already deceased Jin Ryeong, the remaining four had joined forces to attack Lee Gwak.

Their combined attack was more terrifying than that of any other absolute masters. Having reached the state of telepathic communication where words were unnecessary, they attacked Lee Gwak as if they were one body.

But no matter what attack they used, no matter what ultimate techniques they unleashed, Lee Gwak blocked them without difficulty.

Lee Gwak was a massive wall.

To the Moonshadow Six Fairies, Lee Gwak felt like an insurmountable cliff.

Lee Gwak presented them with immense despair.

Every swing of his blade threatened their lives.

Yet they did not retreat.

They burned their vitality with the Blood Demon Pill, turning themselves into fiends that felt no pain. Their only goal: hold him as long as possible.

Not to win—just to delay.

But even that failed.

One by one, they fell. Starting with the youngest, Cho Yuseon, each perished.

At last, only Oh Cho-hye remained.

She clung on desperately, so ferociously that even Lee Gwak grew weary of it.

But all battles end.

She collapsed at last, fatally wounded.

“Lee… Gwak!”

She summoned the last of her strength to cry his name.

But Lee Gwak gave no reply.

Though she was an enemy, she had been admirable. Yet, he would not offer her empty praise.

They had simply fought for their lives. Nothing more needed to be said.

“Lee GwAAAAK!”

Her venom-filled scream rang out, echoing in the sky.

And then, like a lie, she crumpled lifeless.

“Hoo…”

At last Lee Gwak let out a quiet sigh.

“Brother!”

Cheol Gwang-woo approached him.

His entire body was drenched in blood, dyed crimson from head to toe.

Lee Gwak spoke:

“Let’s go. We’ve wasted too much time.”

“Yes, Brother.”

The living departed on their journey, and crows came flocking down over the bodies of the dead.
