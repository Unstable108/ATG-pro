Episode 2: A Small Leaf is Easily Shaken Even by the Faintest Wind (3)

Once all preparations were complete, the Outer Hall martial artists lined up in front of the inner city gates.

A soft groan escaped from Lee Gwaks mouth.

He had seen the main gate of the inner city countless times while staying in the outer city, yet he still couldnt get used to the oppressive and imposing aura it exuded.

The gate, which stood three zhang high and more than one zhang thick, was entirely cast from iron.

Just one side of the gate weighed over ten thousand kilograms. It was impossible for ordinary people to even move it, let alone open it.

This colossal gate served as a divide between two worlds.

The outer city and the inner city.

Those inside the inner city could leave for the outer city through that gate whenever they pleased. However, those outside couldnt enter freely.

Though everyone lived within the Jade Heaven Alliance, this door starkly divided their statuses.

Lee Gwak had once wished to see the world beyond that gate, but in the end, he never managed to cross the barrier and remained in the outer city.

He thought he had grown quite indifferent, but standing before the gate again, a part of his heart inevitably felt bitter.

The martial artists from the Outer Hall stood in formation, waiting for the gate to the inner city to open.

After what felt like an endless wait, the massive iron gate finally screeched open.

The martial artists of the Outer Hall watched intently, their expressions tense.

As the gate fully opened, red-clothed martial artists standing in a line inside the inner city came into view. They were all wearing robes red as blood, and even their hats matched the hue.

It was as if one was looking at a red wave.

An intense aura flowed from them, akin to the ferocious waves of the North Sea in the heart of winter, threatening to destroy everything in their path.

Lee Gwak clenched his teeth.

The energy emanating from them stirred his nerves in an ominous manner.

They possessed an intense, distinctive atmosphere that could never be felt from the martial artists of the Outer Hall. Their aura was alive with a ferocity that only those who had experienced and survived numerous battles could possess.

Their eyes were so fierce that Lee Gwak did not dare to look them in the eye.

Turning his head, Lee Gwak discreetly asked Oh Guhong,

Who are they?

One of the hidden swords of our alliance, I suppose.

Oh Guhongs reply indicated that he didnt know. Or perhaps, he was pretending not to know. One thing was clear they lived in a world different from Lee Gwak.

Eventually, all the red-robed individuals exited the inner city. But they werent the last. Following them were a hundred martial artists dressed in black.

Lee Gwaks eyes shone.

They were the same black-clothed martial artists who had arrived on the dawn when Han Socheon and others had entered the city, and now they were all lined up, riding black horses.

Just seeing them made him feel suffocated.

Though they numbered only a hundred, their presence and pressure far surpassed the hundreds of red-robed individuals.

At their forefront was Gwan Il-hyeon.

Gwan Il-hyeons eyes scanned the surroundings with a mischievous gleam. Lee Gwak lowered his head to avoid his eyes. He knew from experience that nothing good could come from locking eyes with such individuals.

Gwan Il-hyeons entire body exuded an air of dominance. He looked around the inner city of the Jade Heaven Alliance with a gaze as if he had nothing to fear in the world.

It was a look that could only be possessed by someone who had never been defeated in his life.

Even though he was in the Jade Heaven Alliance, the enemys stronghold, there was no trace of nervousness in him. In fact, his smile seemed to suggest that he was secretly enjoying the pressure.

The Jade Heaven Alliance is not that special after all.

That was actually what Gwan Il-hyeon was thinking at that moment.

He was the first person from the Celestial Demon Union to enter the Jade Heaven Alliance in over a hundred years. He had every reason to be proud.

Suddenly, he looked behind him.

Over a hundred black-clothed martial artists were following him.

The Black Armored Cavalry.

One of the elite units of the Celestial Demon Union. The formation of a hundred Black Armored Cavalry was particularly optimized for hunting absolute masters.

Only the Union Leader could command the Black Armored Cavalry. Under normal circumstances, Gwan Il-hyeon wouldnt have the authority to lead them. So, him being allowed to do so right now was evidence that Jin Gwang-hon, who was both the Union Leader and his master, trusted him deeply, Gwan Il-hyeon thought.

His whole body trembled with excitement.

Ideally, he wanted to hunt down the Lunatic Pugilist on his own, so that he would not have to go through the complicated process of seeking out the Jade Heaven alliance.

Even though the Lunatic Pugilist was said to be terrifying, Gwan Il-hyeon thought that with the hundred men of the Black Armored Cavalry, he would have the best chance of victory. However, he wanted to be on the safe side, so he sought out the Jade Heaven Alliance and asked for their cooperation.

The Celestial Demon Unions hundred Black Armored Cavalry were joined by the four hundred members of the Bloodcloaked Death God Battalion, 2 one of the secret forces of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

With this kind of power, they were confident they could hunt down anyone, not just the Lunatic Pugilist.

Gwan Il-hyeon looked at the leader of the Bloodcloaked Death God Batallion.

White Blood Sword, Yuk Hyeon.

With his face half covered by his blood cloak, his eyes were as fierce as a wild wolfs.

Dont order me around, brat. I decide when to set off.

Your alliance leader should have ordered you to follow my orders though.

Thats why Im holding back. You Celestial Demon Union brat.

Heh! Are you still holding onto the grudge from over a hundred years ago? How narrow-minded.

Watch your mouth. If you slip, I might just tear it off.

I can deal with you right now if you want, but who would be in more trouble if I did?

The corners of Gwan Il-hyeons mouth twisted upward. He was obviously sneering at Yuk Hyeon.

For a moment, Yuk Hyeons temper flared causing him to reach for his sword. But he couldnt draw it in the end. As much as he wanted to tear Gwan Il-hyeon apart, the Jade Heaven Alliances orders were more important.

Consider yourself lucky, brat!

With those words, Yuk Hyeon firmly closed his mouth.

Basking in the feeling of victory, Gwan Il-hyeon gave the command.

The Black Armored Cavalry charged forth with vigor, followed by the Bloodcloaked Death God Battalion. They mounted their horses and quickly disappeared from the Outer Hall warriors sight.

Only then did the Outer Hall leader, Maeng Hee-cheon, give the order.

Outer Hall, lets move out too!

The assembled Outer Hall martial artists began to move in unison.

Seok Yi-cheon turned to Oh Guhong and asked,

Why are they riding out ahead? Werent we supposed to go together?

I told you, we probably wont have to fight directly. The fight will likely be over by the time we arrive there. Theres no reason for us to get there together with them since were just providing support in case something unexpected happens.

Ah! So, we just need to handle the aftermath.

Seeing the light of relief on Seok Yi-cheons face, Oh Guhong frowned.

If youre a martial artist, shouldnt you be upset about not being able to fight?

What about you, squad leader?

Im not upset about it at all.

Neither am I.

Hehe! I feel the same. Im not upset at all.

Members of Squad 13 laughed heartily.

Oh Guhong snickered.

Members of Squad 13 were on the same wavelength.

Lee Gwak walked alongside them with a furrowed brow. He wanted to laugh as well, but for some reason, he couldnt bring himself to.

A deep sigh escaped from Lee Gwaks lips. His head and shoulders were covered with a thin layer of gray dust.

He wasnt the only one. All the other martial artists from the Outer Hall walking with him looked tired and worn out.

For the past few days, they hadnt had proper rest, they had been constantly on the move. No matter how well theyd mastered their martial arts, such a forced march was bound to be tiring.

Everyone, hang in there a bit longer. Were almost at our destination.

Oh Guhong encouraged the members of Squad 13.

Didnt you say the same thing three hours ago?

Members of Squad 13 cursed at Oh Guhong.

Lee Gwak also cursed Oh Guhong but only in his mind, he didnt say it outwardly.

Even though they were warriors who have mastered martial arts and possessed superior physical strength as compared to ordinary people, they still couldnt help but feel exhausted from the continuous march. Their legs wobbled, and they were short of breath.

Just when they thought they couldnt go on, a voice called out.

We have reached our destination!

A strong voice echoed from the front.

It was a welcome announcement.

The place where the Outer Hall martial artists had come to a stop was in a large clearing on the banks of a fairly wide river, but the open area had already been set up with numerous tents. They must be from those who had come before them.

Large flags and banners could be seen flying all around the area. Each flag was engraved with clear characters made of gold thread.

Dragon Sky Valley, and Zealous Justice Sect?

Lee Gwaks pupils trembled.

Both the Dragon Sky Valley and the Zealous Justice Sect were factions belonging to the Ten Supremes. This meant that they were among the top ten most powerful forces in Jianghu. Such sects usually have pride so high that they would never join forces with each other unless it was for a significant matter.

What? Does this mean that the unknown force has managed to mobilized not only the Jade Heaven Alliance, but also both the Dragon Sky Valley and Zealous Justice Sect?

Lee Gwak intuitively sensed that something much bigger than he had imagined was happening. Something someone of his level couldnt possibly even guess, much less know of.

Just then, men who appeared to be leaders from both factions approached and greeted the leader of the Outer Hall, Maeng Hee-cheon.

Jang Il-mo of the Dragon Sky Valley greets the leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

I am Oh Kyung-seol of the Zealous Justice Sect. Its an honor to meet you.

Its an honor for me as well, to meet the two of you with such great reputations. I am Maeng Hee-cheon of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

They exchanged greetings naturally, as if they had already discussed it beforehand.

Unbeknownst to Lee Gwak and the martial artists of the Outer Hall, the leader of the Inner Court, Joo Shin-yoon, had already requested cooperation from the Dragon Sky Valley and Zealous Justice Sect under the name of the Jade Heaven Alliance Leader.

No matter how much the pride of these two factions reached the heavens, they couldnt possibly refuse the request of the leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance himself which was why they had sent out and dispatched their elites here.

Jang Il-mo and Oh Kyung-seols eyes were filled with wariness as they looked at Maeng Hee-cheon. Though they had joined because of an order from above, the idea of moving together with the Jade Heaven Alliance was quite uncomfortable for them.

It had already been over a hundred years since the Dragon Sky Valley and Zealous Justice Sect established themselves in Jianghu, but even if they had expanded their power and influence at a terrifying pace, they still couldnt be compared to the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Had their opponent not been the notorious Lunatic Pugilist, they wouldnt have mobilized their elite forces.

Both the Dragon Sky Valley and Zealous Justice Sect had previously suffered significant losses against the Lunatic Pugilist, hence they sent out their elites. The true elites from both factions had already joined forces with the Black Armored Cavalry.

The only ones left here now were the organizations that supported the elites, just like the Outer Hall of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Maeng Hee-cheon asked,

Would you happen to know where our alliances Bloodcloaked Death God Battalion is at?

Ive heard that theyve discovered the location of the Lunatic Pugilist, and thats why they are tracking him down right now.

In that case, they may be clashing with him soon.

Thats right.

Maeng Hee-cheons eyes shone.

The elites of the Celestial Demon Union and Jade Heaven Alliance, as well as the elites of the Dragon Sky Valley and Zealous Justice Sect. This was the first time in over a hundred years since this many martial artists of this caliber had gathered together in one place.

Even if their opponent was the infamous Lunatic Pugilist, with this number and caliber of elites, he was confident they could hunt him down with minimal casualties.

Jang Il-mo laughed,

We probably wont need to get involved. The elite forces that have been mobilize to take down the Lunatic Pugilist are far beyond anything weve ever seen.

Thats true. We just have to wait here for the good news.

Oh Kyung-seol agreed with Jang Il-mo.

He didnt feel much of a crisis from their situation, which was true for Maeng Hee-cheon as well.

Although he had come here on a support mission, he was relieved that he didnt have to actually fight and shed blood.

As the leaders of the three factions were chatting leisurely,

Suddenly, a loud explosion erupted from the perimeter of their camp.

Screams of terror immediately followed.

Whats happening?

The once-relaxed faces of Maeng Hee-cheon and the others changed instantly.

At that moment, another explosion erupted, and more screams filled the air.

Whats going on?

Maeng Hee-cheons pupils shook.

It was then.

I-Its the Lunatic Pugilist!

Damn it! Its the Lunatic Pugilist!

The various screams and shouts of the warriors brought Maeng Hee-cheon back to his senses.

Good heavens! Why is the Lunatic Pugilist here? Werent the Bloodcloaked Death God Battalion tracking him down?

At that moment, a fierce gust of wind suddenly swept through, causing many of the warriors to be blown away in every direction.

Amidst the maddening wind, Lee Gwak managed to open his eyes. He could see an old man charging towards him.

The elderly man, with flying white hair, had a terrifying aura swirling around him.

Qua-qua-qua!

Tents were torn apart, and people were flung into the air.

Lee Gwaks eyes widened.

Even though they had been sent here to support, and not fight, they were still trained martial artists, so the sight of such warriors being reduced to chunks of meat and flying around in a blink of an eyes was so foreign, that it almost seemed surreal.

Damn it! Stop him!

Stop it, old man!

Familiar faces could be seen chasing after the old man.

Gwan Il-hyeon and Yuk Hyeon, along with the Black Armored Cavalry, and the Bloodcloaked Death God Battalion, as well as the elites from the Dragon Sky Valley and Zealous Justice Sect.

All of their faces had fear and chaos written on it.

They had discovered the Lunatic Pugilist in a remote mountain fifty miles from their camp. They had planned to bide their time, slowly encircling him before ambushing him. But the situation changed quickly and drastically when the Lunatic Pugilist noticed their presence.

Contrary to their expectation that he would flee to a deserted area, the Lunatic Pugilist had, instead, went for and attacked the place where their reinforcements were present.

The series of events all happened before they could organize themselves.

And so with that, a hellish scene, which Lee Gwak had never once imagined, unfolded before his eyes.
