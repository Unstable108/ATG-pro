The one who approached Lee Gwak was a woman wearing a bamboo hat. Due to the hat, her face was not visible, but her slender figure and voice, which sounded like it was whispering by his side, were impressive.

Dark eyebrows, deep and black eyes, a straight nose, small red lips, and skin as white as snow – she had all the features of a beauty.

The woman gave Lee Gwak a formal bow.

“My name is Sa Yeon-hee, from Martial Sword Troupe. You are Master Lee Gwak, correct?”

“That is correct.”

“I’m sorry for approaching you so suddenly. There’s something I wanted to ask you, so I took the liberty of coming here. May I sit down?”

“Ah! Please, take a seat.”

Lee Gwak permitted, and Sa Yeon-hee took the seat in front of him.

There was dignity in Sa Yeon-hee’s speech and actions. Lee Gwak guessed that she must have a high status within the Martial Sword Troupe.

“How did you know where to find me?”

Lee Gwak looked at Sa Yeon-hee with caution.

He had only been on Haenam Island for a day. During that time, Lee Gwak hadn’t caused any trouble or done anything to draw attention. Yet, she had come looking for him, knowing his name, which naturally made him wary.

Sa Yeon-hee seemed to read Lee Gwak’s caution and started with an explanation.

“I heard from the Azure Maritime Company. They said you encountered the Nine Shadows Fleet at sea. Is that correct?”

“Yes, it is.”

“And that Master Lee Gwak defeated the Nine Shadows Fleet, allowing everyone to be safe.”

“I’ve been chasing the Nine Shadows Fleet for a long time. But their tracks are very elusive, and it’s been difficult to track them. You may not know, but the Nine Shadows Fleet leaves no survivors.”

“Fortunately, there was a ship that was attacked by the Nine Shadows Fleet and still managed to dock safely.”

“That would be the Azure Maritime Company.”

“Exactly.”

Finally, Lee Gwak realized what had happened.

Someone from the Azure Maritime Company had talked about what happened at sea, and the story had reached Sa Yeon-hee’s ears.

“Do you want to know about the situation at that time?”

“No, I’ve heard about the situation from others. What I want to know are your impressions and feelings about directly facing them.”

“You want to know my thoughts?”

Sa Yeon-hee looked intently at Lee Gwak, as if trying to peer into his innermost thoughts.

Her gaze was very deep. Her pupils were clearly defined in black and white, and she exuded a spirited aura. What was most surprising was the strong internal energy she radiated.

‘A master!’

To Lee Gwak, Sa Yeon-hee seemed much stronger than Yook Cheon-ban and Gu Ok-rin he had seen at the harbor.

After organizing his thoughts for a moment, Lee Gwak began to speak.

“I’m not sure about the others, but the martial arts of the leader seemed to be extraordinary.”

“In what way?”

“He was using a qi sword. I’m not entirely sure, but it seemed to consist of nine forms and nine variations.”

“Are you certain?”

At that moment, Sa Yeon-hee’s expression turned solemn.

“It might be better to show you directly.”

Lee Gwak picked up a chopstick. Sa Yeon-hee watched his actions attentively.

Recalling the swordplay Dam Il-cheon had displayed, Lee Gwak imitated it.

Having fought directly, Lee Gwak was able to imitate Dam Il-cheon’s moves closely. Although he couldn’t know the inner workings of the martial arts involved.

Seeing Lee Gwak unfold the swordplay with a chopstick, Sa Yeon-hee couldn’t hide her astonishment.

She thought it would be remarkable even if Lee Gwak roughly recreated the atmosphere. Reproducing swordplay with a short chopstick was not an easy feat even for a great master.

But Lee Gwak vividly recreated the swordplay with a short chopstick. It was a difficult task even for her.

‘A master…’

Only then did she realize that Lee Gwak was a much greater master than she had vaguely assumed.

While she did not know his actual martial arts skills, his understanding and application were unparalleled.

Having heard that he had repelled the attack of the Nine Shadows Fleet, she had thought he was a master, but she had no idea he was a martial artist to this extent, so her surprise was even greater.

Sa Yeon-hee forcibly suppressed her curiosity about Lee Gwak. What was important at the moment was not Lee Gwak’s identity but the swordplay he was displaying.

“That’s all for now.”

Finally, Lee Gwak finished the demonstration and put down the chopstick on the table.

A sigh involuntarily escaped Sa Yeon-hee’s lips. Her gaze was settled. The swordplay Lee Gwak displayed was very similar to some martial arts she knew. However, it was too early to jump to conclusions.

There were many martial arts in the Jianghu with a similar atmosphere, and some forms were surprisingly similar.

“I don’t know if I was of any help?”

“It was a great help. Thank you, Master Lee Gwak.”

“It’s nothing.”

“Could I possibly know which sect you belong to?”

Lee Gwak blinked at Sa Yeon-hee’s sudden question. It was unexpected. Then Sa Yeon-hee added as if to excuse herself.

“I’m curious about which sect could nurture a master like you. If you don’t feel like answering, you don’t have to.”

“I’m sorry.”

“No, I should be the one to apologize.”

Sa Yeon-hee apologized.

After looking at Lee Gwak for a moment, Sa Yeon-hee seemed to make up her mind and spoke.

“I am in charge of the Sword Sect in the Martial Sword Troupe.”

“Sword Sect?”

Lee Gwak tilted his head, having never heard the name before.

“You probably haven’t heard of it. It’s not something exposed to the outside.”

The Sword Sect, which Sa Yeon-hee was a part of, was a very special organization within the Martial Sword Troupe. Even the Troupe Leader, Southern Sea Martial Emperor Yu Mun Sang, could not interfere with the actions of the Sword Sect.

The founder of the Martial Sword Troupe, a hundred years ago, was an absolute martial artist called Hae-wol of Haenam Sect.

She had made significant contributions during the Great Heavenly Blood War and later gathered the fallen South Jianghu upon returning to the Haenam Sect. That was the beginning of the Martial Sword Troupe.

In her later years, Hae-wol built a small pavilion and went into seclusion. She passed on her own profound understanding, separate from the Haenam Sect’s martial arts, to her disciples, marking the beginning of the Sword Sect.

Even the leader of the Martial Sword Troupe could not issue orders to the head of the Sword Sect. They could only request cooperation, and even then, if the head refused, they could not be compelled.

However, it was not as if the Sword Sect lived completely apart from worldly affairs. They maintained a balance and supported the Martial Sword Troupe both overtly and covertly.

Therefore, the words of the leader of the Sword Sect had the second highest authority after the leader of the Martial Sword Troupe.

Sa Yeon-hee was the current Sword Sect Leader.

“If you encounter any difficulties while staying in Haenam Island, just mention my name. That should resolve most problems.”

“Thank you for your consideration.”

“I should be the one thanking you. Thanks to you, I’ve found some clues.”

“That’s good to hear.”

“Sorry for disturbing your rest. I’ll take my leave now.”

Sa Yeon-hee stood up from her seat.

After taking a bow of respect to Lee Gwak, she left the inn. Left alone, Lee Gwak murmured to himself.

“She appeared like the wind and disappeared just as suddenly.”

He was curious about what she had found in his swordsmanship, but Lee Gwak decided not to dwell on it further.

He knew from experience that most troubles in the Jianghu arose from unnecessary interest and meddling.

What Lee Gwak wanted was to return to the Jianghu as quickly as possible to meet Han So-cheon and the 13th squad.

At that moment, the innkeeper approached with a tray. The liquor bottle on the tray caught his eye.

“This is the famous Maotai wine from Jangmyeong Inn.” ＊＊＊ Many islands existed near Haenam Island.

Though none were as overwhelmingly prominent as Haenam Island, many people lived scattered across these variously sized islands. However, there were islands and waters where no one could live.

Haewang Archipelago was one such place.

Located further south from Haenam Island, it took an additional day to reach. Around ten islands huddled together, always shrouded in sea fog, with reefs lurking around, making even skilled sailors wary of approaching.

Thus, no one lived in the Haewang Archipelago. There was no reason to brave the dangers to settle there when there were many habitable islands.

Yet, people did live there. And quite a number of them.

The largest island at the center of the Haewang Archipelago had a naturally formed bay. The cliffs surrounding the bay served as a natural breakwater, providing safety from high waves.

There were about ten ships in the bay, large and small, streamlined for coastal sailing. These were the ships of the Nine Shadows Fleet.

The Haewang Archipelago was the base of the Nine Shadows Fleet.

Where the ships anchored, a small village had formed. The wooden houses were ramshackle and barely sheltered from the elements, but this was enough for the mild climate throughout the year.

In the centre of the village stood the largest house, built of brick, unlike the other wooden houses.

This was the residence of Dam Il-cheon, the leader of the Nine Shadows Fleet.

Inside the house, in the training yard, Dam Il-cheon was furiously swinging his sword. He had been in the yard since morning, swinging his sword all day long.

Soaked with sweat and muscles screaming in pain, he didn’t stop for a moment. He seemed truly possessed.

Swinging, and swinging, until he collapsed from exhaustion.

“Haah! Haah!”

Dam Il-cheon lay sprawled on the ground, gasping for breath.

His heart felt like it would burst, and his lungs as if they would tear apart. But the pain in his body was nothing compared to the agony of defeat.

Since becoming the leader of the Nine Shadows Fleet, he had never once failed in a raid. No warrior had ever matched him, at least on the sea.

But he had been defeated. And by a completely unexpected opponent, utterly.

His pride was crushed to the ground.

“Damn it all!”

No matter how much he swung his sword, his shattered pride did not recover.

At that moment, a figure quietly approached Dam Il-cheon on the ground. He looked down at Dam Il-cheon and opened his mouth.

“Have you cooled down a bit?”

Dam Il-cheon quickly got up.

“Are you okay?”

“I’m sorry.”

Dam Il-cheon bowed to the old man.

The old man appeared to be in his early to mid-fifties. His sunburnt face was dark, and his back was significantly bent. In his hand was a metal cane.

This old man was Dam Il-cheon’s master. He was the true ruler of the Nine Shadows Fleet. Although he had passed everything to his disciple and retired from the front lines due to age.

The old man looked at his disciple with a pitying expression.

His disciple had never experienced failure or defeat, advancing triumphantly. Perhaps that’s why this first defeat felt especially bitter.

“I’m sorry. I’ve shown a disgraceful side.”

“I’m sorry for failing the raid at such a critical time.”

“It can’t be helped. Who could have known that such a master would be aboard the Azure Maritime Company’s ship?”

Despite his master’s consolation, Dam Il-cheon’s expression did not lighten.

He clenched his teeth, remembering Lee Gwak’s face. Though it was only one encounter, he couldn’t forget his face.

“Let’s forget about this failure. Did you not expect such a day would come?”

“You’ve done very well so far. That’s why your elder brother is very satisfied with you.”

“Forget about the defeat. There will be good news soon.”

“I… understand.”

Eventually, Dam Il-cheon bowed his head to his master. However, the anger on his face had not yet dissipated.

The old man looked at him with sorrowful eyes.

His disciple was too talented to be satisfied with mere piracy.

His mastery of the Nine Life Stealing Sword to the extreme showed how exceptional his talent was.

The old man had no doubt that Dam Il-cheon would overcome the shock of defeat and grow even more.

The old man patted Dam Il-cheon’s shoulder and said,

“I will be away for a while.”

“Are you going to Haenam Island?”

Dam Il-cheon quickly looked up at the old man. The old man smiled and said,

“It seems I need to see for myself how things are unfolding.”

“May I accompany you?”

“You too?”

“Is that not possible?”

Desperation appeared on Dam Il-cheon’s face.

After looking at Dam Il-cheon for a moment, the old man reluctantly nodded.

“Alright.”

Finally, a smile appeared on Dam Il-cheon’s face.
