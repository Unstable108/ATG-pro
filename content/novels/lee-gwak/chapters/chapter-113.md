“Is that the Crimson Blood Fortress?”

It was evening when they arrived at the Crimson Blood Fortress, following Joo Cheongwang

The sight of the Crimson Blood Fortress’s walls, shining in the sunset’s red glow, elicited a gasp of awe from the martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance. The ominous aura made them shiver.

Numerous martial artists were lined up on the walls of the Crimson Blood Fortress, seemingly showing respect and welcoming the Jade Heaven Alliance’s delegation in their own way.

However, the martial artists of the Jade Heaven Alliance were not naive to believe that the Crimson Blood Fortress was simply showing them respect.

It was a silent threat. A warning not to cause any trouble within the Crimson Blood Fortress’s walls, or they would not be spared.

Jang Gwang and the elite of the Siege Fortress emitted a killing intent. Many of the martial artists standing on the walls were known to them.

They had clashed and fought against each other on the battlefield several times. Some had killed each other’s comrades, and conversely, they had killed their opponents’ comrades as well. With deep-seated grudges, they were individuals who could never coexist under the same sky.

They reminded themselves not to get agitated, but upon seeing those from the Crimson Blood Fortress, their blood boiled with rage. The same was true for the martial artists standing on the walls of the Crimson Blood Fortress.

Jang Gwang said to Yong Cheon Myeong, “This is as far as we can escort you. Young Master.”

“Thank you, I will not forget this favor.”

“Young Master, I pray that you complete your mission safely and return. On the day of your return, I will be the first to wait for you.”

“Ha-ha! The day I return, the history of the Jianghu will shake tremendously. Let us share a drink then.”

“It would be an honor.”

A look of emotion crossed Jang Gwang’s face.

Yong Cheon Myeong smiled and walked towards the Crimson Blood Fortress.

The giant gates opened with a scream of the hinges.

A strange heat rose on Yong Cheon Myeong’s face.

Although there were many martial artists in the Jade Heaven Alliance, none had officially crossed this gate before.

He was the first person to officially pass through the gates of the Crimson Blood Fortress.

Being the first in anything was destined to become history.

‘The Jianghu will forever remember my steps.’ Yong Cheon Myeong walked towards the Crimson Blood Fortress with an unyielding stride.

The gazes of the martial artists within the Crimson Blood Fortress were fixed on him. Enduring an immense pressure that most people couldn’t handle, he kept moving forward, step by step.

Following him, the delegation entered the Crimson Blood Fortress.

Finally, everyone had entered, and the gate closed firmly behind them.

Jang Gwang stood for a moment, gazing at the firmly closed gate of the Crimson Blood Fortress. Under the sunset, it looked like a red monster standing tall, appearing almost cursed.

‘Someday, I will personally bring down that fortress.’

Jang Gwang made a firm resolution and looked back at his subordinates.

“Let’s return to the siege fortress.”

They turned back the way they came.

Lee Gwak’s gaze was deeper than ever before.

The eyes of Yong Cheon Myeong and the delegation were all focused on the majestic grandeur of the Crimson Blood Fortress and the martial artists of the Celestial Demon Troupe. However, Lee Gwak was paying attention to the structure of the fortress.

‘As expected, there are mechanical traps laid out here.’

The main roads within the Crimson Blood Fortress appeared ordinary at first glance. However, with just a few changes, it could instantly become the worst trap in the world.

Everything Lee Gwak saw was a threat. martial artists who had only trained in martial arts could not see what Lee Gwak was seeing, even if they were dead and brought back to life.

‘Whoever designed this place is well-versed in trap mechanisms.’

Someone as proficient in mechanisms as his master, Maa Doo Won, existed within the Celestial Demon Troupe too. He had the bizarre wish to meet the person who designed the Crimson Blood Fortress.

Joo Cheongwang led the delegation to the largest hall within the fortress.

In front of the magnificent hall stood a beautiful woman dressed in white, her eyes covered with white silk, giving her appearance a mysterious allure.

Joo Cheongwang approached the woman and greeted her with a fist salute.

“We have brought the delegation from the Jade Heaven Alliance. Lady Seon.”

“You’ve worked hard, Lord Joo.”

Joo Cheongwang turned to Yong Cheon-myeong.

“Please greet her. This is Lady Seon, one of the Moon Shadows of the Celestial Demon Troupe’s Six Moon Shadows who serves as the Saintess of our Celestial Demon Troupe.”

“Saintess?”

Yong Cheon-myeong’s eyes sparkled.

He had heard stories about the existence of a Saintess in the Demonic Sect, which could be considered the predecessor of the Celestial Demon Troupe. However, that was a hundred years ago.

He had not expected that the position of Saintess would still be carried on, even after the transformation into the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Yong Cheon Myeong greeted her politely.

“I am Yong Cheon Myeong from the Jade Heaven Alliance. It is a pleasure to meet you.”

“I have heard many stories about the great hero from the Jade Heaven Alliance, who is unparalleled in the world. Seeing you in person, it seems the stories were not even enough. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am Oh Cho-hye, the one serving the Saintess, just call me Lady Seon for simplicity.”

Her eyes, visible through her veil, were crescent shaped. Her simple smile radiated a captivating charm that made many a man’s heart flutter.

Yong Cheon Myeong steadied his wavering heart with a calm mind and asked,

“But why is Lady Seon here?”

“I am tasked with guiding you through the Celestial Demon Troupe.”

“You mean Lady Seon will personally guide us?”

A glint appeared in Yong Cheon Myeong’s eyes.

“Why would Lady Seon personally undertake such a strenuous task? Someone else could have been assigned.”

“It was a direct request from the Saintess. She has a great interest in this negotiation.”

“Actually, it was the Saintess who most strongly advocated for these negotiations. We never expected the Jade Heaven Alliance to accept the proposal, which is why I came to escort you personally.”

“There’s no need to take it so seriously. Just think of me as a competent guide.”

“A guide.”

Yong Cheon Myeong’s eyes pierced through, as if trying to see through Lady Seon. His fierce gaze, enough to intimidate even the experienced martial artists of the Jianghu, was calmly received by Lady Seon.

“The path to the Celestial Demon Troupe is quite treacherous and complicated. One wrong turn and you could be lost for a long time. That’s why a guide is absolutely necessary.”

“With a beauty like Lady Seon offering to guide the way, there’s no reason to refuse. I gratefully accept your kindness.”

“You must be tired from the long journey. Rest here today and depart tomorrow. We’ve prepared a simple banquet for you, so please enjoy and relax.”

“We’ll enjoy the banquet upon reaching the Celestial Demon Troupe. For today, a place to rest and some food will suffice.”

“Is that so? It’s a pity to miss the opportunity to host the heroes of Jade Heaven Alliance. But if that is your wish, so be it.”

Lady Seon’s dark eyes flickered mysteriously.

Yong Cheon Myeong ordered Jwa Ryoon.

“Assign accommodations for our people.”

“Yes, My Lord.”

Jwa Ryoon bowed and responded to Yong Cheon Myeong.

Yong Cheon Myeong’s gaze returned to Lady Seon.

“I presume the Celestial Demon Troupe wouldn’t dare play tricks on the delegation’s accommodations.”

“Such a thing would never happen. Right?”

Lady Seon’s last remark was directed at Ju Cheon-gwang.

Joo Cheongwang’s expression twisted subtly, but he quickly regained his composure and responded calmly.

“Of course.”

“You heard him? Rest assured and take a good rest. Let’s depart early tomorrow morning.”

Lady Seon gave Yong Cheon Mmyeong her characteristic smile, but his expression remained unchanged.

“Thank you for your consideration. We are tired from our journey and will rest now.”

“Please do.”

Yong Cheon Myeong passed by Lady Seon and entered the hall, followed by the delegation. Lady Seon stepped aside, observing the delegation as they entered the hall.

Jwa Ryoon’s Mystic Martial Squad, Seo Jong Myeong’s Shadowless Squad, and the vagrants passed her one by one.

Some looked at her with hostility, others with curiosity, and a few with lustful eyes. Yet, Lady Seon calmly accepted all their gazes without blinking an eye.

“This woman is no ordinary person.”

Ki Jin-Hwi couldn’t help but admire Lady Seon.

Lee Gwak silently nodded in agreement.

Finally, the 13th Squad passed by Lady Seon. Seeing members like Seok Yi Cheon and others, a look of disappointment flashed in her eyes, recognizing their significantly inferior martial skills.

‘No need to worry about them.’

She no longer felt the need to stand and walked away.

Lee Gwak quietly watched Lady Seon’s retreating figure and moved on.

Jwa Ryoon was assigning rooms to the newcomers as they entered the hall.

When it was Lee Gwak and the 13th Squad’’ turn, Jwa Ryoon spoke,

“The outer hall will use the room at the very end.”

“Understood.”

“Since we don’t know what tricks the Celestial Demon Troupe might play, rely on the food we’ve prepared in advance and warn your men not to consume anything provided here.”

After Lee Gwak’s response, Jwa Ryoon waved them off, indicating they could go to their assigned rooms.

Lee Gwak and his squad entered their assigned room.

The squad members were astonished when they opened the door. Although it looked fine from the outside, inside, the furnishings were destroyed and not cleaned up, resembling a pigsty.

They didn’t expect such accommodations, especially since they were part of the delegation.

“This is why the Celestial Demon Troupe is no good. Their hearts are as small as grains of rice.”

Seok Yi Cheon grumbled as he began to clean up the messy room. Then, Go Cheon Gwang, Woo Il Young, and Cheon Wol joined in the cleanup.

“You’re the squad leader; it wouldn’t be proper for you to engage in such menial tasks.If you really can’t stay still, perhaps go outside to the courtyard and take a walk.”

Eventually, Lee Gwak was pushed by Ki Jin Hwi to step outside the room.

Once outside, he found no particular place to go and sat on a small rock in the courtyard of the room, surveying the interior of Crimson Blood Fortress.

The courtyard of the guesthouse was surrounded by a tall fence, providing a sense of privacy from outside gazes. However, no member of the Jade Heaven Alliance felt truly free within these walls.

On the branches overhanging the walls, on the roofs of opposite halls, there were eyes secretly watching them. The Crimson Blood Fortress was keeping an eye on the delegation’s movements.

For Crimson Blood Fortress, this was a natural measure. Allowing enemies to roam freely inside was tantamount to negligence.

Even now, they were probably watching his every move.

It was then that another figure emerged from the hall.

Recognizing the man, Lee Gwak’s eyes lit up with recognition.

‘Yong Cheon Myeong.’

The man who had come out alone was none other than the Young Master Yong Cheon Myeong himself.

Yong Cheon-myeong seemed to notice Lee Gwak and approached him directly.

Lee Gwak sighed softly, not exactly pleased to confront Yong Cheon Myeong. However, as a subordinate, he couldn’t just ignore his superior approaching.

Resigning himself to the situation, Lee Gwak rose from the rock and greeted Yong Cheon Myeong with a fist salute.

“Outer hall Squad leader Lee Gwak greets Master Yong.”

“Pleasure to meet you, Leader Lee! It seems you’ve been driven out of your room as well.”

Yong Cheon Myeong smiled knowingly, a down-to-earth demeanor uncharacteristic of the Young Master of the Jade Heaven Alliance. He then commented on the rooms.

“Well, with the room in such a mess and being told not to enter until it’s cleaned up, what can one do? Is your room the same?”

“It appears that Joo Cheongwang, the lord of Crimson Blood Fortress, is quite the narrow-minded individual, resorting to such petty tactics.”

“Well, from their perspective, the delegation is hardly a welcome guest. After all, until yesterday, we were at each other’s throats.”

Yong Cheon Myeong’s words sounded like a casual chat. Lee Gwak silently observed him, sensing the aura of a conqueror emanating from Yong Cheon-myeong.

Born into a prestigious family, Yong Cheon Myeong was acknowledged for his overwhelming talent and became the disciple of the Jade Heaven Alliance leader. Everyone revered him, desiring to be under his command.

He was a born ruler, naturally emanating the aura of someone destined to dominate others. As time passed, his aura only grew stronger, exerting pressure on Lee Gwak.
