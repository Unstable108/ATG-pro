Muk Cheon-gang, drenched in sweat, admitted his defeat.

Strictly speaking, he hadn’t lost. To others, it merely appeared that he was at a slight disadvantage, something he could easily overcome. No one could understand why Muk Cheon-gang was admitting defeat over such a small margin.

But Muk Cheon-gang, having faced Lee Gwak directly, understood their difference better than anyone.

At higher levels of martial arts, even a small gap could create a vast difference. Both Lee Gwak and Muk Cheon-gang were already among the top masters in Jianghu.

In Jianghu, there were only a handful of masters who could be considered definitively superior to them. For them, even a slight gap could become an insurmountable wall.

This was Muk Cheon-gang’s current reality.

While sparring with Lee Gwak, his level had risen dramatically. Muk Cheon-gang was inspired by Lee Gwak, and Lee Gwak was inspired by him. Thus, they elevated each other’s skills to a higher level.

Nevertheless, an unbridgeable gap existed between them.Muk Cheon-gang could hold on for now, but a little more pressure, and he would collapse entirely.

That’s why Muk Cheon-gang conceded defeat.

Lee Gwak cupped his hands in respect and spoke.

“That was a good match. I’ve gained a lot from it.”

“I, too, have learned much. Thank you.”

Muk Cheon-gang smiled faintly.

There weren’t many people who could smile in the face of defeat, but Muk Cheon-gang was one of them.

Lee Gwak felt that Muk Cheon-gang would become even more terrifying in the future.His martial arts were already threatening now, and he possessed immense potential for growth.

‘His martial arts aren’t yet complete. But once they are, they’ll be more dangerous than any other in the Jianghu.’

Every martial art has its own unique aura.

Depending on the intent behind its creation and the nature of the person who inherited and perfected it, that aura varied.

What Lee Gwak sensed in Muk Cheon-gang’s martial arts was the stench of death.

His martial arts carried the intent to kill.

Lee Gwak didn’t know who founded the Black Light Style, but he felt that it must have been someone born with an immense desire to kill.

Lee Gwak gazed at Muk Cheon-gang and spoke again.

“I’d like to face you again one day.”

“You’re welcome to challenge me anytime, Master Lee.”

There was no trace of gloom or bitterness in his expression or voice despite his defeat.

Muk Cheon-gang didn’t see defeat as something shameful.

“True martial arts are achieved through ten thousand defeats.”

This was the creed of the Black Light Sect.

Muk Cheon-gang had already experienced dozens of defeats. Adding one more to the list didn’t shame him in the least.

After all, every defeat had only made him stronger.

This time would be no different.

Although he had lost to Lee Gwak today, he would take this defeat as nourishment to refine and enhance his martial arts. With that, the Black Light Sect would inch closer to its ultimate goal: the divine killing arts..

Through his match with Lee Gwak, Muk Cheon-gang had gained the insights needed to further develop his sect’s martial arts. All that remained was to digest these revelations and make them his own.

Dam Su-rin approached Muk Cheon-gang.

Despite his assurances, Dam Su-rin insisted on checking his condition. Only after confirming that he had no serious injuries did a look of relief cross her face.

Dam Su-rin turned her gaze toward Lee Gwak.

“Thank you for granting my request.”

“I should be thanking you for curing Cheong-ah.”

At that moment, Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah called out and ran toward Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak scooped up both children, one in each arm.

“Are you okay? You’re not hurt, are you?” Lee Soo-ah asked, feeling Lee Gwak’s face with her tiny hands. Smiling, Lee Gwak replied,

“As you can see, I’m perfectly fine.”

“Really? You’re not just pretending you’re not hurt, are you?”

Only then did Lee Soo-ah let out a sigh of relief.

Having learned martial arts from Muk Cheon-gang, she knew better than anyone how strong he was. Throughout the match, she had been on edge.

Lee Soo-ah pressed her cheek against Lee Gwak’s, rubbing it affectionately. Lee Gwak smiled as he gently patted her head.

In contrast to the expressive Soo-ah, Lee Cheong remained silent in Lee Gwak’s arms.

However, there was now a healthy flush to Lee Cheong’s face.

Although the Great Indra Elixir had driven out the illness, his stamina had significantly declined, meaning he needed to be extremely cautious. A relapse could occur if he wasn’t careful.

Lee Cheong’s grip on Lee Gwak’s neck tightened. Though he didn’t speak, his face clearly showed how proud he was.

Lee Cheong was glad that Lee Gwak was his father.

He was happy his father was so powerful.

Being held in his father’s arms made him feel protected, and he liked that feeling.

By evening, Dam Su-rin and Bang Ye-in had prepared a feast.

Dam Su-rin brought out a medicinal liquor she had brewed while staying in the Immortal Cloud Valley, and despite her physical discomfort, Bang Ye-in skillfully prepared a variety of dishes.

Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah’s eyes lit up as they saw the food Bang Ye-in had prepared. In Dam Su-rin’s modest hut, there wasn’t much in the way of ingredients other than medicinal herbs and the wild boar caught by Cheol Gwang-woo. Yet, Bang Ye-in had transformed these few ingredients into a spectacular meal.

“Eat as much as you like. I made plenty, so don’t worry about the portions.”

At Bang Ye-in’s words, Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah quickly picked up their chopsticks and spoons.

The children were full of praise as they ate the food. They realized the meaning of food that “melts in your mouth.”

Bang Ye-in’s dishes truly melted in their mouths. With just a few chews, the food seemed to vanish.

Bang Ye-in smiled as she watched the children eat.

Her cooking wasn’t just delicious. It was made with her family’s secret techniques to help revitalize their energy, a special consideration for the still-recovering Lee Cheong.

While the children’s meal was nourishing, the adults’ food was made to pair well with alcohol. She had prepared dishes that complemented the herbal liquor Dam Su-rin had brewed.

“This is some herbal liquor I brewed not too long ago, but unfortunately, it hasn’t fully matured yet. Still, it should be drinkable.”

The Hundred Medicinal Liquor was a liquor brewed from a hundred medicinal herbs, passed down through Dam Su-rin’s family for generations.

It was more of an elixir than a mere drink.

Lee Gwak sniffed the liquor in his cup. Just by smelling it, his mind felt clearer.

“It’s even better when you taste it.”

Muk Cheon-gang smiled as he raised his glass. Lee Gwak followed suit, with Dam Su-rin and Bang Ye-in joining in.

A clear ringing sound echoed as their cups touched.

The moment Lee Gwak tasted the liquor, he was surprised. It felt as if he wasn’t drinking alcohol but an elixir. Just drinking it made his body feel revitalized.

Seeing his reaction, Bang Ye-in smiled knowingly. Lee Gwak turned to her and spoke.

“This is astonishing. It feels more like an elixir than a drink. How can alcohol be this way?”

“It’s made using my grandmother’s secret recipe. If taken consistently, it can help increase internal energy and prevent a hundred illnesses.”

“Your grandmother must have been extraordinary.”

“All my medical skills were learned from her. But my abilities don’t even come close to hers.”

“No, really. That’s the truth. My grandmother used to say it was the nature of the times back then. It was an era filled with countless heroes and villains. Compared to that time, the current Jianghu is definitely weaker. Not in terms of martial arts skills, but in the sheer number of masters who have mastered those arts.”

As someone who had dedicated his life to martial arts, Lee Gwak didn’t particularly enjoy hearing that the current Jianghu was inferior to the past.

Sensing his mood, Dam Su-rin smiled softly and asked.

“Not upset, but I am curious. What’s the basis for such a claim?”

“Martial artists draw energy from the world around them, but that energy is gradually weakening.”

“Hmm! So you’re saying the external energy is decreasing?”

“Not the energy itself, but the amount of usable energy for humans is declining. My grandmother said that the energy of the natural world goes through cycles of growth and decline every few centuries or millennia, and we’re currently in a period of decline.”

“Does she mean the peak was about a hundred years ago?”

“Exactly. Back then, the world was overflowing with good energy, so it was only natural that many great masters emerged. But since that time, the energy has been weakening, and naturally, the number of masters has decreased.”

Lee Gwak nodded unconsciously. He could somewhat understand now.

“According to the natural order, the energy of the world shouldn’t be declining this quickly. But due to certain events a hundred years ago, the heavenly energy became chaotic, accelerating its decline.”

Dam Su-rin hesitated at Lee Gwak’s question. After a brief pause, Muk Cheon-gang, who had been silently listening, spoke.

“Tell him. He’s someone we can trust.”

Sometimes, words weren’t needed to build trust. Muk Cheon-gang, having fought hand-to-hand with Lee Gwak, believed in him.

At Muk Cheon-gang’s words, Dam Su-rin nodded and began to speak.

“My grandfather’s name was Dam Ho. A hundred years ago, he was known as the Fist Demon.”

Lee Gwak wasn’t surprised, having already heard this from Bang Ye-in. Dam Su-rin then asked him.

“Do you know the name Ho Cheon-myeong?”

“Ho Cheon-myeong was a martial artist who orchestrated the Blood Heaven War from behind the scenes. He was one of the Four Emperors of the Jianghu, but at some point, he descended into madness and sought to open the Six Paths. To do so, he needed chaotic energy, and to create that, he incited the Blood Heaven War.”

“Master Lee, can you believe there is another world beyond the one we know? Not just another country like Korea or the Western Regions, but an entirely separate dimension?”

“I know it’s hard to believe, but it’s true. A hundred years ago, Ho Cheon-myeong managed to open a gate to the Six Paths. He was killed by my grandfather just before crossing over, but the gate was opened.”

Lee Gwak’s eyes flickered with disbelief.

If it hadn’t been Dam Su-rin speaking, he would have dismissed it as nonsense. But neither Dam Su-rin nor Muk Cheon-gang were people who would speak of such things lightly.

“What kind of place are the Six Paths?”

“The Six Paths is a realm too complex to be defined by a single term. According to my grandfather, there are beings that have shed their physical bodies and exist only as spirits, and others that are deeply aligned with the forces of darkness. Though I can’t explain it all, it’s clear that it operates by different laws than our world.”

“There’s no need to try to understand it all. It’s beyond our common sense. What matters is that Ho Cheon-myeong opened the gate to the Six Paths a hundred years ago, and that event severely damaged the energy of the world. My grandfather is holding the gate closed for now, but in a few hundred years, it will open again.”

“Wait! Are you saying the Fist Demon is still alive?”

The Fist Demon had lived a hundred years ago. The fact that someone from that era was still alive was shocking enough, but hearing that he was holding back the gate to another world was even more astounding.

However, upon reflection, Lee Gwak remembered that his own master, Gwang Noh-ya, had also lived for more than a century. Though the exact number wasn’t clear, it seemed he had lived close to two hundred years. Given that, it was plausible the Fist Demon was still alive. Yet, accepting the existence of the Six Paths was a separate matter.

“After returning from the Six Paths, time stopped for my grandfather. When I last saw him, he still looked as young as he did in his prime.”

“Before crossing back into the Six Paths, my grandfather said he would hold the gate shut for as long as possible, but once the energy of the world weakened further, the gate would open again. When that happens, the Jianghu as we know it will no longer exist.”

“It’s a hard story to believe.”

“I understand. I feel the same way. But my grandfather never once lied.”

A look of longing passed through Dam Su-rin’s eyes.

Her grandfather, who was known to be the coldest and most ruthless man in the world, had always been incredibly kind to her.

Even now, she missed him dearly.

Although they lived in the same era, being in different worlds meant they could not meet.

Lee Gwak felt a strange resonance deep within his heart.

The man who had shaken the world a hundred years ago.

The story of that man stirred something within him.

Their conversation continued long into the night.
