Lee Gwak and his group set out early in the morning for the horse market.

Because it was located at a busy crossroads with heavy foot traffic, a large horse market had formed naturally in Cheonsu.

Escort agencies and merchant caravans transporting large quantities of goods would replace tired horses or purchase new ones here. As a result, one of the largest horse markets in the Jianghu had grown in this place.

Even at this early hour, many people were buying and selling horses.

The animals stamped the ground with their hooves or snorted as they waited for their new masters. Merchants and martial artists carefully inspected the horses’ condition.

They had to choose wisely; a horse would be their companion on a long journey.

Lee Gwak’s party was no exception.

The only difference was that they didn’t need to choose a particularly fine breed.

As long as the horse was sturdy enough to pull a wagon without tiring, it was sufficient.

Lee Gwak purchased two large horses and a rather big wagon He would have preferred a covered carriage, but none were available-perhaps all had already been sold. Reluctantly, he settled for the large wagon.

Seo Jong-myeong examined the wagon and exclaimed in surprise.

“Huh! This wagon is excessively large.”.

“It was used by a merchant caravan for transporting goods. Though it’s a bit big, we have no other options, so we’ll have to make do.”

“Well, more space is better, I suppose.”

Seo Jong-myeong nodded at Lee Gwak’s explanation.

Just then, a middle-aged man approached Lee Gwak.

He greeted them politely with a fist salute.

“Greetings. I am Ji Sang-il, the head of a small escort bureau called the Iron Order Escort Bureau.”

“Oh! Nice to meet you. I’m Ki Jin-hwi. What brings you here?”

Ki Jin-hwi stepped forward with exaggerated enthusiasm. Ji Sang-il cautiously replied.

“Actually, one of our wagons was damaged, and we were wondering if you might be willing to sell yours. We’re prepared to pay extra.”

“That’s difficult. As you can see, we have an injured man and a child with us.”

Disappointment flashed across Ji Sang-il’s face, but he quickly regained his composure and asked.

“Then… may I know your destination? If we’re headed in the same direction, perhaps you [a] could load some of our cargo in your wagon? Of course, we’ll pay you well.”

“Hmm.”

At Ji Sang-il’s proposal, Ki Jin-hwi looked at Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak didn’t answer immediately but instead observed the Iron Order Escort Bureau’s camp.

The bureau’s escorts were watching the negotiation cautiously. Strangely, most of them were unusually young.

While martial prowess was important for an escort bureau, experience was even more critical. Such bureaus were typically staffed by seasoned, middle-aged martial artists rather than young ones.

In fact, most of the escort bureaus Lee Gwak had encountered so far had more older members. But the Iron Order Escort Bureau was an exception, with young martial artists forming the core.

Some of them even appeared to possess considerable martial skills.

‘Do they have some special circumstances?’

Lee Gwak frowned slightly.

Experience had taught him that traveling with such people often led to trouble. Unusual companions brought unusual incidents.

However, Lee Gwak hesitated to refuse them outright because the escorts’ eyes shone with sincerity.

At the very least, they didn’t seem to harbor ill intentions or deceit.

Lee Gwak gave Ki Jin-hwi a slight nod. Ki Jin-hwi smiled and said to Ji Sang-il.

“We’re heading toward Hebei Province.”

“Ah! Perfect. Our destination is Taiyuan in Shanxi Province. To reach Hebei, you must pass through Taiyuan. How about traveling together? Of course, we’ll pay generously for the space.”

“Very well. We’ll accompany you.”

“Thank you. Haha!”

Ji Sang-il finally broke into a relieved smile.

Had Ki Jin-hwi refused, he would have had no way to move the cargo. Building a new wagon was an option, but it would delay their schedule.

For an escort bureau, adhering to schedules was crucial. Though borrowing the wagon would cost more, ensuring they stayed on schedule was more beneficial for the Iron Order Escort Bureau.

Ki Jin-hwi smiled and spoke.

“Since we’ll be traveling together unexpectedly, let’s take care of each other.”

“You’ve done us a great favor. We’ll make sure your journey is as comfortable as possible.”

With a broad smile, Ji Sang-il gestured to the porters.

“Leave space for these folks to sit, and load the cargo. Make sure they aren’t

inconvenienced.”

“Yes, sir. Don’t worry.”

The porters took the wagon out of the market.

Outside the market, the Iron Order Escort Bureau had already finished preparations for departure.

“Wow!”

Ki Jin-hwi couldn’t help but exclaim at the sight of the convoy.

The bureau’s scale far exceeded his expectations.

There were over twenty carts waiting, each piled high with goods. One cart had a completely broken axle and was leaning to one side, which was why they had urgently sought Lee Gwak’s help.

The laborers quickly transferred the goods from the broken wagon to Lee Gwak’s.

“Hurry up!”

“Heave-ho!”

Sweat poured from the laborers’ brows as they moved the heavy cargo. Their faces flushed red from the effort.

Once the goods were securely loaded and tied down, there was still plenty of space left for seating.

But another problem arose.

Ki Jin-hwi muttered as he alternated his gaze between the horses and the wagon.

“Two horses won’t be enough to pull this.”

“We have the horses that were pulling the broken wagon. We’ll attach them to yours.”

“Ah! That should work.”

Ji Sang-il assigned the two horses from the broken wagon to Lee Gwak’s carriage, bringing the total to four.

“Alright! Problem solved. Let’s move out!”

At Ji Sang-il’s command, the escorts and laborers mounted their horses and wagons.

Lee Gwak’s group also boarded their wagon and Ki Jin-hwi took the reins as the driver.

His skillful handling allowed Lee Gwak, Seo Jong-myeong, and Lee Soo-ah to sit comfortably.

As soon as the wagon started moving, Seo Jong-myeong closed his eyes and began his cultivation. Fortunately, the high stacks of cargo and a cloth screen hid him from outside view.

Meditating in a bumpy, moving wagon was extremely dangerous, but the mental technique Seo Jong-myeong practiced was exceptionally stable, preventing any adverse effects even on rough

roads.

While Seo Jong-myeong focused on his cultivation, Lee Gwak and Lee Soo-ah chatted quietly.

“Dad!”

“Hmm?”

“Won’t traveling with an escort bureau slow us down?”

“An experienced escort bureau might actually help us reach our destination faster.”

“But these people don’t seem very experienced.”

.

Lee Soo-ah’s observation was sharp.

Despite her young age, her life in the Jianghu had given her plenty of experience. She sensed something odd about the Iron Order Escort Bureau’s composition.

“Uncle Oh’s Jeon Gong Escort Agency had many older escorts, but the Iron Order Bureau doesn’t seem to have any.”

“They’re definitely different from the usual escort bureaus.”

“Do they have some special circumstances?”

“Probably.”

As Lee Gwak nodded thoughtfully, Lee Soo-ah wrinkled her nose. Her expression was adorable.

Lee Gwak chuckled and ruffled her hair. Lee Soo-ah, who had been serious, broke into a bright smile.

Lee Gwak spoke to her.

“We don’t need to know their circumstances. As long as we reach our destination safely, that’s all that matters.”

“I guess you’re right.”

“We have a long journey ahead. You should cultivate too.”

“Okay.”

Lee Soo-ah nodded and immediately began cultivating. Watching her, Ki Jin-hwi remarked to Lee Gwak.

“Raising a daughter doesn’t seem easy.”

“What do you mean?”

“She’s so curious about everything. I don’t think I could answer as patiently as you do.

Isn’t it exhausting?”

“Well, it can be, but she’s my child, so even that feels endearing.”

“Hah! You’re completely smitten.”

“Isn’t that what parenthood is about?”

“I’m a little envious.”

“Isn’t it about time you settled down too?”

“Who knows when my restless spirit might act up again? This nomadic life suits me. I’ll never have a daughter, but at least I have a lovely niece like Soo-ah. That’s enough for me.”

Knowing Ki Jin-hwi spoke sincerely, Lee Gwak simply smiled.

Just then.

“What are you talking about so animatedly?”

Ji Sang-il, the bureau chief, rode up alongside their wagon.

“Just chatting about this and that.”

“I see. Your group seems very close.”

“We wouldn’t be traveling together otherwise.”

“By the way, I don’t believe I’ve properly introduced myself to this gentleman yet.”

Ji Sang-il’s gaze settled on Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak cupped his fists in salute.

“My apologies for the late introduction. I’m Lee Jin-mun.”

“Ah! So you’re Sir Lee. I’m Ji Sang-il. It’s a pleasure to travel together.”

“We’ll be in your care for a while.”

“No, it’s we who are in your debt. If you have any discomfort, please let us know.”

“Understood.”

Lee Gwak’s alias, Lee Jin-mun, was already well-known in the martial world. However, Ji Sang-il didn’t seem familiar with it.

Even if he had heard the name, he wouldn’t connect it to Lee Gwak.

To Ji Sang-il, Lee Gwak appeared as nothing more than a devoted father, not an awe-inspiring martial artist.

Lee Gwak asked Ji Sang-il.

“Your cargo seems quite heavy.”

“Yes. We may have overcommitted, so the load is substantial.”

“Might I ask what you’re transporting?”

“I’m sorry. The client insisted on strict confidentiality.”

“Ah! My apologies for the intrusive question.”

“Not at all. It’s a natural curiosity. I’ll take my leave now. Please continue your conversation.”

Ji Sang-il bowed slightly and rode back to his position.

Lee Gwak silently watched him go.

The journey with the Iron Order Escort Bureau was smooth.

Though the young escorts sometimes got flustered, Ji Sang-il always stepped in to resolve problems skillfully.

This allowed Lee Gwak’s group to travel in comfort.

Seo Jong-myeong could devote himself to cultivation, and his health improved greatly.

He wasn’t at his peak, but had recovered to around seventy or eighty percent.

Of course, this didn’t mean he had regained his former martial prowess. Months of imprisonment had left his muscles atrophied and his body stiff.

With his internal injuries mostly healed, he now needed systematic physical training to restore his former state.

Whenever they stopped, Seo Jong-myeong would disembark and train relentlessly.

Beads of sweat rolled down his body.

His dedication began to draw the young escorts’ attention.

From a distance, Ji Sang-il murmured.

“I thought he was ill, but he’s a wounded master.

At first, Seo Jong-myeong’s appearance had masked his martial prowess. But seeing him train made it clear he was a formidable martial artist.

“Every movement exudes lethality. Though his exact identity is unclear, he’s undoubtedly honed his skills through real combat.”

Go Yu-rak, the bureau’s deputy chief, observed keenly.

Ji Sang-il clicked his tongue.

“Tsk! We only approached them to borrow a wagon, but unexpectedly, we’re traveling with a master.”

“The others don’t seem ordinary either.”

“True.”

Ji Sang-il’s gaze shifted to Lee Gwak, Lee Su-ah, and Ki Jin-hwi, who were chatting idly on the wagon.

Even in their relaxed state, an air of grace and composure surrounded them.

“Lee Jin-mun… I feel like I’ve heard that name somewhere before.”

“Me too. It’s strangely familiar. Do you remember where you heard it?”

“That’s the problem I can’t recall the name. Well, if it’s truly a name I know, it’ll come to me eventually. Right now, that’s not what’s important.”

“Right. Delivering the cargo safely is our top priority.”

At Go Yu-rak’s words, Ji Sang-il nodded.

It had been fifteen days since they began traveling with Lee Gwak’s group.

Perhaps they were lucky, because their journey had been smooth and uneventful so far.

Their destination, Dragon Ship Dock, was now close.

“I hope we reach the dock soon.”

“Agreed. I’d like to hand over this troublesome cargo quickly and be free of the burden.”

Go Yu-rak shared Ji Sang-il’s sentiment.

They ended their short rest and set out again. But the Iron Order Escort Bureau did not get far before they had to stop.

Up ahead, a village called Pyeongseong was burning.

The blood wind was blowing toward them.
