Before anyone realized, the season was already rushing toward winter.

Already more than three months had passed since the Celestial Demon Troupe and the Heavenly Justice Alliance had been locked in a standoff. Both sides had taken heavy losses in the previous clash, so they had stepped back to catch their breath. But everyone knew—the current peace would not last long.

“Before the real winter sets in, the decisive battle will be fought.”

Once snow fell, large-scale war would become practically impossible. The matter had to be settled before then.

Neither the Celestial Demon Troupe, who had lost support from the Myriad Merchant Troupe, nor the Heavenly Justice Alliance, who were burdened by the influx of new members, wanted to prolong the war.

There had been no agreement, no secret pact, but the mood on both sides was unanimous—this would end quickly.

The Heavenly Justice Alliance, swollen with martial sects and warriors, was as chaotic as an open marketplace.

Hastily constructed buildings and huts had sprung up, forming new streets, and facilities like brothels and inns had been established. In just a few months, a new city had been born.

The streets bustled with martial artists, and among them were merchants hoping to strike it rich. For these merchants, a war over the fate of the martial world was an opportunity to earn fortunes. Most of these merchants were small-scale operators seeking a big score.

Large merchant groups and established merchants knew they could only survive if the Heavenly Justice Alliance won, so they provided all the support they could.

Thanks to this, a great deal of wealth circulated within the Heavenly Justice Alliance, and paradoxically, the place bustled with vitality.

“Wow! Can you believe this?”

Is this really the Thousand Kingdom School—no, the Heavenly Justice Alliance?”

Newly joined warriors couldn’t adjust to the unexpected atmosphere and kept looking around.

Among them was a boy who had just arrived at the Heavenly Justice Alliance.

Among them was a young boy who had just arrived. Still looking childish, he gazed about with wonder.

“Stop staring, you’re embarrassing!”

The girl walking beside him scolded, but the boy didn’t care.

Finally, the girl appealed to the woman next to them.

“Mother, can’t you tell Cheong to stop? It’s so embarrassing to walk with him.”

The woman, smiling softly, was Han So-cheon. The children with her were Lee Cheong and Lee Sua.

After assassinating Eun Il-myeong at Willow Wood Manor, Han So-cheon had joined the Heavenly Justice Alliance with the children.

They had longed to see Lee Gwak, and also wanted to help him, so they came straight to the alliance. Though they had hurried, blocked waterways and roads had delayed them.

Han So-cheon and Lee Soo-ah wore excited faces at the thought of reuniting with Lee Gwak. Lee Cheong, however, was too absorbed in his surroundings to notice.

Despite his sister’s nagging, he kept wandering and staring. Eventually, Soo-ah couldn’t stand it and tugged on Han So-cheon’s hand.

“Let’s go ahead.”

“Shall we?”

“Cheong will find his way on his own anyway.”

“Leave him—he’ll find his way.”

“Alright.”

Han So-cheon nodded. After all, they were inside the alliance, so there was no danger of getting lost or hurt.

The two women left Lee Cheong behind and quickened their pace.

Cheong, however, slowed down as he scanned the surroundings.

Though he hid it, he was gauging the morale of the alliance.

Not bad. With this spirit, they have a chance of winning.

He sighed in relief.

Just then, someone caught Lee Cheong’s eye.

A boy who looked slightly older than him.

Like Lee Cheong, he was walking down the street alone, without any attendants.

He seemed only a few years older than Lee Cheong, but the boy looked strangely solid. He carried a weighty aura, the kind one usually feels only from seasoned veterans who have experienced all kinds of hardships.

At that moment, the other scenery faded from Lee Cheong’s eyes, and only the boy remained.

Lee Cheong stood still, staring blankly at the boy. Perhaps sensing Lee Cheong’s gaze, the boy stopped and looked back.

Their eyes met in mid-air.

Instantly, a spark of interest lit up in the boy’s eyes. Just as Lee Cheong had sensed the boy’s extraordinary aura, the boy too had noticed that Lee Cheong was different from ordinary children.

“…….”

Lee Cheong and the boy looked at each other for a while.

The one who broke the silence and approached the boy was Lee Cheong.

“Hello!”

“…….”

The boy said nothing, lips sealed, but Cheong asked cheerfully, unbothered.

“I’m Lee Cheong. What’s your name, brother?”

“Jang Cheon-hwa.”

“So you’re Cheon-hwa hyung! Nice to meet you!”

“Did you say Lee Cheong?”

“Yeah! Problem with that?”

“No.”

Cheon-hwa shook his head, but his eyes stayed fixed on Cheong.

He clearly recognized him.

Cheong, too, sensed it.

Lee Gwak’s fame had shaken the martial world, but few knew of Cheong. Only a handful—like the disciples of Mad Martial Sect—knew Lee Gwak had a son. However, the expression on Jang Cheon-hwa’s face was one that only someone who knew Cheong’s true identity would have.

Jang Cheon-hwa’s gaze was deep and heavy.

Until now, Lee Cheong had never once seen anyone his own age with such eyes.

‘Heavy and scary!’

Lee Cheong read the essence hidden behind Jang Cheon-hwa’s gaze.

It was the same for Jang Cheon-hwa.

‘This kid!’

Lee Cheong possessed a sharpness in his eyes that was completely at odds with his innocent-looking face. In front of his gaze, it felt like no one could hide their true intentions.

Jang Cheon-hwa’s gaze grew even deeper.

It was the same for Lee Cheong.

“Oraboni!”

“You’ve been through a lot.”

Lee Gwak gently embraced Han So-cheon’s body.

The scent of blood still lingered on Han So-cheon’s body. Normal people wouldn’t notice, but a martial artist at Lee Gwak’s level could sense even the faintest trace of blood.

She had once again killed for his sake. Gratitude mixed with guilt welled up in him.

They held each other silently.

“Father!”

It was only after Lee Soo-ah’s voice that the two separated.

Lee Gwak looked and saw Lee Soo-ah puffing out her lips.

“I came too.”

“Sorry, my daughter.”

As Lee Gwak apologized and picked up Lee Soo-ah, she beamed a bright smile as if she had never been sulking.

Seeing that, Lee Gwak also burst out laughing.

After laughing for a while, Lee Gwak asked.

“Where’s Cheong?”

“He’s so busy looking around inside the Heavenly Justice Alliance. He’ll be here soon.”

“Is that so?”

“Yes! Don’t worry. He’s not so foolish that he’d get lost or get into trouble somewhere.”

Just as Lee Gwak smiled again at Lee Soo-ah’s words—

Dang Dang Dang!

Suddenly, urgent bell sounds rang out.

Lee Gwak’s expression changed in an instant.

There was only one reason for bells to ring in the Heavenly Justice Alliance.

Shinmayeon had attacked.

Lee Gwak and Han So-cheon dashed outside.

The leaders of the Cheonui Alliance were already gathered on the hastily built walls.

They leapt up to join them.

“Lord Leader!”

“Hero Lee!”

The leaders greeted him, but Lee Gwak ignored them and fixed his gaze on the distance.

“Hm!”

A low hum escaped his lips.

The ground had turned black with an approaching mass of troops.

“So they’re finally launching a full-scale offensive.”

So Gun-myeong’s face hardened. The others too.

For the past few days, there had been unusual signs from the Celestial Demon Troupe’s camp. Im So-bo had predicted that they would launch a full-scale attack soon, and her prediction had come true.

The only consolation was that the Heavenly Justice Intelligence had also made thorough preparations in anticipation of the enemy’s all-out assault.

Now, clumsy tricks would no longer work.

Only a direct confrontation of force remained.

Numerous martial artists climbed onto the walls. Even those who had just been drinking in brothels and other establishments appeared. Their drunkenness was long gone.

“Finally!”

“The time has come for me to step forward.”

They even wore expressions that seemed excited.

If they won this war, and achieved merit, they could become heroes of the Jianghu in an instant.

They deliberately ignored the high probability that they might die in this war, imagining only the glory they would enjoy if they survived.

“Alliance Leader! Just give the order. I will be the first to charge forth and take the leader’s head!”

“This Jang Mo will take the vanguard. Just leave it to me!”

They competed, asking Lee Gwak to place them in the vanguard. But Lee Gwak let their words go in one ear and out the other.

Lee Gwak’s gaze and all his nerves were focused on the center of the massive army slowly approaching.

His gaze pierced deep into the enemy’s center.

There—

‘Go Geom-wol!’

Although he was obscured by countless soldiers, Lee Gwak felt his presence.

Finally, Geom-wol had moved.He was staking everything on this final battle.

If he moved, Lee Gwak too must move.

Lee Gwak stretched his left arm out behind his back.

From his quarters, a blade shot through the window like lightning and landed in his grasp.

Many gasped at the sight, as if the blade had flown of its own will.

So Gun-myeong, who was standing beside Lee Gwak, was the most surprised by his skill.

‘This bastard!’

So Gun-myeong bit his lip without realizing it.

Because he could see just how profound Lee Gwak’s level was.

At first, it seemed like Void Manipulation, but Lee Gwak’s technique was beyond that.

Such control was only possible if blade and will were one.

Even the arrogant So Gun-myeong felt crushing defeat. He had once believed he might rival Igwak someday, but the gap was wider than he imagined.

At that moment, Lee Gwak’s voice woke him from his thoughts.

“Today is the last day.”

“…….”

Everyone held their breath and listened to Lee Gwak’s voice.

“Whether we win or lose, today is the last day for the Heavenly Justice Alliance. But if we must end, let it be a victory. I believe you all feel the same.”

Lee Gwak’s soft voice was strangely clear.

“Let’s win.”

Silence.

“Let’s win, survive, and someday look back on this moment. Even if the glory is scarred and blood-stained, let’s live to taste it.”

“…”

“Thank you for fighting beside me. It’s an honor to share this moment. Let’s all live—and meet again.”

Hearing Lee Gwak’s voice, the martial artists felt something surge up from deep within their chests.

It was his calm, yet sincere voice that moved them.

Shraaang!

A warrior drew his sword and shouted:

“Ha! Let’s all live and meet again!”

“Let’s survive and see each other!”

“Let’s meet alive!”

The martial artists around him gripped their weapons and shouted with him. Their voices, almost contagious, soon spread throughout the entire Heavenly Justice Alliance.

Woo Woong!

Everyone’s shouts became one massive roar that spread through the sky above the Heavenly Justice Alliance.

“Pfft! What’s with all this corny talk…”

Cheol Gwang-woo wrinkled his nose.

Despite his words, the look in his eyes as he watched Lee Gwak shone more intensely than ever before.

Cheon Wol, Ki Jin-hwi, and Seo Jong-myeong all looked at Lee Gwak with the same kind of eyes.

Lee Gwak did not speak of grand goals or dreams like the other Supreme Masters. He always spoke of survival, and he always led from the front for everyone.

He showed his will through actions rather than words, and his will become a guiding light for them, wandering in the darkness.

In that way, Lee Gwak always took the lead, becoming everyone’s guide. And as always, they were ready to follow him without any doubt.

Swoosh!

Lee Gwak launched himself forward.

He showed his will through actions rather than words,

and it became a guiding light for those wandering in the darkness.

In that way, Lee Gwak always took the lead, becoming everyone’s guide. And as always, they were ready to follow him without any doubt.

Swoosh!

Lee Gwak launched himself forward.

He was the first to charge toward the enemy lines, and behind him, warriors from the Mad Martial Sect and countless others followed.

“Waaaah!”

The great battle that would decide the fate of the Jianghu had begun.
