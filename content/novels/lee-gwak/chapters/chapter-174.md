With the rumor spreading that Cha Moo-gyeong had a close relationship with Lee Gwak, no more vagrants in Leizhou dared to trouble him.

However, someone else came looking for him.

The visitor was a man in his late forties with a slight build.

“Are you Master Lee Gwak?”

“That’s me, but who might you be?”

“I am Lee Won-chang, the head of the Shenyang Escort Service. Master Cha recommended you, and I’ve come to employ your services.”

Lee Gwak then remembered what Cha Moo-gyeong had mentioned.

Shenyang Escort Service was the largest in the Leizhou area. It had many escorts under its employment and a wide operational area.

Lee Gwak asked with a puzzled expression, “But with so many escorts in your service, why specifically hire a vagrant?”

“The cargo we are tasked with transporting this time is exceptionally valuable. Given the circumstances, we would even borrow a cat’s paw if necessary. So, I reached out to Master Cha, who is renowned as the best in the vagrant market here, and he recommended you”

“May I know what the cargo is?”

“I apologize, but I can’t disclose the details of the cargo. That’s one of the conditions set by our client.”

At Lee Won-chang’s words, Lee Gwak slightly furrowed his brow.

Lee Won-chang appeared to be a skilled martial artist.

While it was unclear exactly how skilled he was, he seemed to be at a higher level than the usual vagrants active in the vagrant market.

If such a skilled individual needed help, Lee Gwak surmised that the cargo must be extraordinarily valuable.

“Will you be joining the escort mission personally, then?”

Yes, I will personally oversee the escort due to the exceptional value of the cargo. Not only have we hired you, but we’ve also employed several other vagrants from the market as a precaution. Though I don’t anticipate any trouble, it’s best to be prepared

Confidence was evident on Lee Won-chang’s face.

Shenyang Escort Service had never failed in a cargo transport mission before. Their team was strong, and their confidence in themselves was high.

Hiring vagrants was simply to cover all bases, even though Lee Won-chang considered it unlikely that anything would go wrong

Lee Gwak came highly recommended, having been vouched for by Cha Moo-gyeong, who is considered one of the best among vagrants. If a martial artist of Cha’s caliber endorsed him, he would indeed be a significant asset.

Lee Gwak gestured towards Cheol Gwang Woo, who was standing off to the side, “I plan to bring him along as well, if that’s alright with you?”

“I heard about what happened in the vagrant market. He has great strength, doesn’t he? We would also welcome him.

“Thank you.”

With that, Lee Gwak proceeded to sign a contract with Lee Won-chang, sealing a deal that included Cheol Gwang Woo for eighty silver coins.

Considering the typical cost of hiring a vagrant didn’t exceed thirty silver coins, the amount was exceptionally generous, indicating the importance Lee Won-chang placed on this mission.

Hearing about the contract with Shenyang Escort Service, Seop Yu-saeng commented, “You’ve secured a good deal. Shenyang Escort Service is the most reputable in the region. You shouldn’t encounter any problems traveling with them.”

“I hope so.”

“Anyway, this is great news. I was worried about sending you off alone…”

“Are you planning to go somewhere else?”

“It’s time for me to head home. Don’t feel too bad about it. If fate allows, we’ll meet again.”

Seop Yu-saeng smiled kindly.

Lee Gwak gave him a respectful fist-and-palm salute.

“Thank you for everything up until now.”

“I, too, enjoyed our time together. If you ever find yourself in Jingshan, feel free to visit Ye Family Manor. You’ll always be welcomed with open doors.”

“If I’m ever in Jingshan, I’ll be sure to visit.”

“Until next time, then.”

Seop Yu-saeng then left the inn.

Just like his arrival, his departure was just as sudden.

Lee Gwak watched Seop Yu-saeng’s retreating figure for a long time. ＊＊＊ Shenyang Escort Service was headed by Lee Won-chang and comprised five leaders, twenty-five escorts, and twenty porters

While the number of personnel was not particularly large compared to other escort services, the team was made up of elite members. The five leaders were undoubtedly skilled, and the escorts were all experienced experts.

Even the porters, responsible for menial tasks, had learned enough martial arts to defend themselves.

Such a thoroughly elite team was not common among escort services, which is why the pride of the Shenyang Escort Service was sky-high.

Their pride was reflected in their behavior. They did not even glance at Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo upon their arrival, effectively ignoring them outright.

The other vagrants fared slightly better, with some acknowledging them due to previous joint operations.

“Ah! Those guys…”

Cheol Gwang Woo frowned deeply.

His normally mild-mannered face momentarily turned fierce, but then Lee Gwak spoke up.

“Ease your face.”

Without hesitation, Cheol Gwang Woo relaxed his face, reverting to his usual gentle demeanor. Still young, Cheol Gwang Woo was not accustomed to such atmospheres, but Lee Gwak had plenty of experience.

This level of standoffishness hardly qualified as an insult. Being treated as if he didn’t exist was the norm for Lee Gwak at the Jade Heaven Alliance, and he had endured far worse treatment that was indescribable.

“Even if we’re treated as mere luggage, it’s for the best as long as no trouble arises. So, there’s no need to feel upset”

“In the Jianghu, these situations are common. Reacting angrily every time is foolish. So, you should also learn to temper your temper.”

“Understood, brother!”

Cheol Gwang Woo readily accepted Lee Gwak’s advice.

He looked at Lee Gwak with eyes shining with trust, showing how much he believed in him.

At that moment, an elderly leader from the escort Service approached them.

“So, the famous figures from the vagrant market have arrived. Welcome! I’m Du Yeo-gwang, a leader of the Shenyang Escort Service.”

“I’m Lee Gwak.”

“And I’m Cheol Gwang Woo.”

Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo both gave Du Yeo-gwang a respectful fist-and-palm salute. Du Yeo-gwang examined Cheol Gwang Woo from head to toe, continuously expressing his admiration.

“Wow! You’re really big. You must be strong.”

“I’ve never lost to anyone in terms of strength.”

“I can see that. You look reliable.”

Du Yeo-gwang smiled warmly.

Then, his gaze shifted to Lee Gwak.

“I hope you understand their standoffishness. The cargo we’re escorting is extremely valuable, so everyone’s a bit on edge. And there’s some resentment about hiring outsiders, as if they don’t trust their own.”

“We understand. Don’t worry about us. We’ll follow quietly, as if we’re not even there.”

“Then, thank you.”

Du Yeo-gwang laughed, showing his yellow teeth.

Cheol Gwang Woo’s expression slightly hardened, realizing Du Yeo-gwang’s approach was not merely out of goodwill.

He wanted to hear Lee Gwak’s final word, an assurance they would stay quietly in the background and not step forward.

Cheol Gwang Woo felt anger bubbling inside him but remembered Lee Gwak’s advice and forcibly suppressed his irritation.

Lee Gwak then asked Du Yeo-gwang, “Where should we follow in the procession?”

“Given this friend’s size, a regular horse won’t suffice. Luckily, the carriage at the very end has less cargo loaded, so you can follow there. And if you could keep an eye out for any suspicious figures at the back, that would be even better.”

“We’ll do that.”

“You’re easy to talk to. Then, I’ll leave you to it.”

Du Yeo-gwang patted Lee Gwak’s shoulder a couple of times before returning to his position. Cheol Gwang Woo snorted like a bull but managed to quell his anger, heeding Lee Gwak’s words.

Then, Lee Won-chang, the head of Shenyang Escort Service, appeared outside with someone. It was an old man wearing a hooded cloak. Although the hood was pulled down low, making it hard to see his face, the wrinkles on his visible neck and hands suggested he was quite old.

As soon as the old man came out, he boarded a large carriage in the middle of the procession.

Cheol Gwang Woo whispered to Lee Gwak, “That old man must be the owner of the cargo, right?”

“It seems so.”

Lee Gwak nodded.

To Lee Gwak, the identity of the cargo’s owner mattered less than the fact that the convoy was heading near the Jade Heaven Alliance

“Let’s get on the carriage.”

The two boarded the carriage at the very end of the procession.

As Cheol Gwang Woo climbed aboard, the carriage creaked ominously, as if it might break at any moment, prompting a slight frown from the porter already on board.

“I’m not sure if the carriage can withstand this.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Well, it can’t be helped. Try to stay as still as possible.”

Cheol Gwang Woo, like a convict, bowed his head and hunched down in the carriage’s cargo space, resembling a bear curling up. Lee Gwak chuckled and sat next to him.

“I’m sorry, brother. Because of me, it’s cramped here.”

“I don’t mind. This has its own charm, actually.”

Cheol Gwang Woo responded to Lee Gwak’s answer with a youthful smile. When not scowling, his face still looked quite young.

“We’re departing.”

The voice of Lee Won-chang, the head of the escort Service, could be heard from the front.

The lead of the procession moved first, and the carriage carrying Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo was the last to set off.

‘Not bad.’

Lee Gwak leaned against the wall of the carriage, watching the passing scenery.

The back of the procession wasn’t a strange place for him.

It had been the same during his time at the Jade Heaven Alliance and when he participated in the envoy. His position had always been at the very end, but he wasn’t upset. Instead, he found comfort in the familiarity

“Brother!”

After the carriage had been moving for a while, Cheol Gwang Woo cautiously started a conversation.

“What is it?”

“It’s about the Vajra Demon Shadow Technique. You mentioned that to deeply understand it, one must comprehend the principles of Buddhism. Does that mean I have to become a monk?”

“The principles of Buddhism are more about studying the mind, so there’s no need to become a monk necessarily.”

“Hehe! That’s a relief.”

Cheol Gwang Woo laughed, rubbing his head with his large hand. Just the thought of having to shave his head and spend his life reciting scriptures in a monastery made him shudder.

“I suspect the creator of the Vajra Demon Shadow Technique might have been from the Shaolin Temple.”

“Shaolin Temple?”

The manual contains descriptions that evoke the landscape of Shaolin Mountain, where Shaolin is located. For example, phrases like ‘the profound mysteries of all directions’ and ‘the winding path that leads to seclusion’ are commonly used to depict Shaolin Mountain

Cheol Gwang Woo looked stunned by Lee Gwak’s explanation. He was surprised that passages he had glossed over were actually descriptions of Shaolin Mountain. He was also impressed by Lee Gwak’s extensive knowledge.

‘Brother is truly amazing. How does he know all this?’

In fact, Lee Gwak’s possession of such knowledge was a relatively recent development.

His master, Gwang Noh-ya, was a man of vast knowledge and experience. Apart from teaching martial arts, he often shared his knowledge with Lee Gwak.

Thanks to this, Lee Gwak naturally acquired various kinds of knowledge he previously didn’t have.

His understanding of the essence of the Vajra Demon Shadow Technique was also thanks to Gwang Noh-ya’s teachings.

‘The monk who created the technique must have been submerged in rage, determined to seek revenge even if it turned him into a demon. Thus, those who practice the technique without a proper understanding of the Buddhist principles risk being overtaken by inner demons, losing their rationality, like Cheol Gwang Woo recently.’

Taking the opportunity, Lee Gwak explained to Cheol Gwang Woo about Buddhist martial arts and mindset. Although his knowledge wasn’t deep, it was sufficient to give Cheol Gwang Woo some understanding.

Cheol Gwang Woo also took the chance to ask about things he was curious about.

“Hmm! So, this passage insists on taking a breath at the Heavenly Pillar point…”

“The Heavenly Pillar point connects the head and body, so mishandling it could easily invite madness. It suggests taking your time with the practice to avoid such risks.”

Lee Gwak compared and answered, drawing on the Eight Snakes Art.

He might not have been an expert in Buddhist martial arts, but recalling and comparing to the Eight Snakes Art allowed him to infer quite a bit.

A look of joy naturally appeared on Cheol Gwang Woo’s face.

No one had ever taught him like this before. Thirsty for knowledge, Cheol Gwang Woo found Lee Gwak’s teachings as refreshing as rain on dry land.

But Lee Gwak wasn’t just bestowing kindness on Cheol Gwang Woo. Comparing the Vajra Demon Shadow Technique with the Eight Snakes Art, he too was gaining insights.

As the saying goes, teaching is also a learning process, and Lee Gwak was a prime example.

Meanwhile, the porter driving the carriage found the cargo space too quiet and looked back.

His eyes widened in surprise.

Clearly, Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo were deep in conversation, but their voices, as if blocked by an invisible wall, didn’t carry at all.

‘What’s going on?’
