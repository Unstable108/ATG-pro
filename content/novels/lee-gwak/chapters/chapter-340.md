“No way, miss! How did you come here?”

Cheol Dae-san approached Bang Ye-in with a surprised expression.

“Have you been well?”

“I’ve been fine, but what brings you here, miss?”

“Hehe, I came to see you, big bear.”

“Miss!”

Cheol Dae-san raised his voice at Bang Ye-in’s nonchalant reply, but she remained unfazed, her face still beaming with a smile.

After glaring at Bang Ye-in for a moment, Cheol Dae-san’s gaze shifted to Cheol Gwang-woo.

“You! If the young miss was stubborn, you should have stopped her!”

“Who could’ve stopped her? I had no choice.”

Cheol Gwang-woo shrugged his shoulders.

“Damn it!”

“Don’t worry, big bear! ‘Little bear’ here will protect me.”

The “little bear” was none other than Cheol Gwang-woo.

Not only did they resemble each other in appearance, their physiques were almost identical, and they happened to share the same surname ‘Cheol’.

Bang Ye-in had brought Cheol Gwang-woo to the West Wind Inn, run by Cheol Dae-san, and the two men were stunned by how much they resembled each other.

That day, they became sworn brothers and were affectionately called big bear and little bear.

Cheol Gwang-woo tried to reassure Cheol Dae-san.

“Ye-in came here for your sake, brother.”

“For me?”

“The atmosphere in this new inn you opened is not normal.”

“Hmm!”

Cheol Dae-san murmured thoughtfully.

It had been a year since he closed his inn in the Seige Fortress and settled here. . But now, signs of a bloody storm seemed to be brewing once again here.

“It must be a curse on me. Why does bloodshed follow wherever I move?”

“Don’t worry too much. Now that brother is here, everything will be fine.”

“Brother?”

It was then that Cheol Dae-san noticed Lee Gwak’s presence and looked at him.

His eyes shook as if there had been an earthquake.

“Could it be?”

“It’s been a long time.”

“Really, it’s you. How did you get here?”

Cheol Dae-san grabbed Lee Gwak’s hand vigorously.

His face was filled with emotion.

After their last encounter, Lee Gwak’s exploits had been not just impressive but legendary.

No young martial artist in Jianghu could match Lee Gwak’s achievements. Therefore, Cheol Dae-san, despite being older, respected him.

“I had some business nearby, so I stopped by.”

“Come on, let’s not stand here. I’ve got some good ingredients, so let’s see Miss’s skills after a long time”.

“What about the wall…?”

Lee Gwak’s gaze turned toward the inn’s wall.

Cheol Gwang-woo had thrown one of the Mangshan Seven Demons, creating a large hole in the wall.

Cheol Dae-san replied nonchalantly.

“Well, the one who made the hole will fix it. No need to worry about that. Let’s go inside.”

Cheol Dae-san pulled Lee Gwak inside, with Bang Ye-in trailing behind.

Left alone, Cheol Gwang-woo made a face.

It would take him half a day to repair the hole by himself, and by then, Bang Ye-in’s cooking would be gone.

Being her lover, he knew how painful it was not to be able to eat her food.

Cheol Gwang Woo approached Mangshan Sa-cheon, who was lying around.

He reached out with his massive hand, gripping the head of Mak Sa-cheon, the eldest of the Mangshan Seven Demons.

“Ugh!”

Mak Sa-cheon whimpered.

It felt like a giant iron clamp was crushing his skull. The pressure was so immense that his head felt as if it could burst at any moment.

Only then did Mak Sa-cheon realize that the man before him was an unimaginable martial artist.

“P-please…!”

Mak Sa-cheon begged, tears and snot streaming down his face.

Dignity meant nothing to him now. Saving his life was a hundred times more important than pride.

Crack!

Cheol Gwang-woo forcibly turned Mak Sa-cheon’s head towards the hole in the wall. The horror of his neck bones snapping made Mak Sa-cheon’s eyes widen in fear.

Cheol Gwang-woo whispered to him.

“Fix the wall. Now! Can you do it? If you say no, I’ll rip your little head right off your body.

“Ugh!”

“How about it? Easy, right?”

“Yes! Very easy!”

Mak Sa-cheon nodded frantically.

Only then did Cheol Gwang-woo release his grip, a satisfied expression on his face. Mak Sa-cheon’s face finally showed relief.

Cheol Gwang-woo picked up a chair lying around and sat down in the middle of the room, watching Mak Sa-cheon.

Mak Sa-cheon quickly woke up his unconscious brothers and they began to repair the broken wall.

The sight of the notorious Mangshan Seven Demons with their broken limbs hastily repairing the walls and windows of the inn was a rare sight.

“Unbelievable!”

“The Mangshan Seven Demons…?”

People whispered in awe at the unusual scene.

Though the Mangshan Seven Demons’ faces burned with shame, they dared not resist under Cheol Gwang-woo’s watchful gaze.

The remaining six demons glared at the youngest who had provoked Bang Ye-in and Cheol Gwang-woo .

‘If only that bastard hadn’t started the trouble…’

‘What a shame.

The sound of their teeth grinding seemed to reach the youngest, whose face turned pale as he sensed his impending fate.

With all seven of them working together, the repairs were completed in no time.

Cheol Gwang-woo stood up in satisfaction.

“Good job! Now get out of here.”

“Really? Thank you!”

“Go live quietly. If I hear you’ve committed any more evil deeds, I’ll come find you and rip your heads off myself.”

“Eek!”

Mak Sa-cheon and the Mangshan Seven Demons turned pale.

It wasn’t just the threat that frightened them, it was the savage aura radiating from Cheol Gwang Woo.

By constantly reading Buddhist texts and accompanying Bang Ye-in, he had learned to control his madness to a certain extent.

Normally, he kept his madness in check, but when necessary, he could unleash it at will.His concentrated madness struck fear into the Mangshan Seven Demons.

“We will live quietly.”

“We will be as good as dead.”

The Mangshan Seven Demons nodded vigorously.

Finally, Cheol Gwang Woo’s face lit up with satisfaction.

He patted Mak Sa-cheon on the shoulder several times before walking towards the kitchen.

The Mangshan Seven Demons didn’t look back as they fled.

The people watching the scene were astonished.

“Wow! What’s going on here? This can’t be a dream, can it?”

“Exactly. I don’t know if this is a dream or reality. A martial artist who could make the Mangshan Seven Demons run with their tails between their legs, and to think he calls someone brother. What exactly is this inn?

Inside the kitchen, there was a small room.

It was a place where Cheol Dae-san rested during breaks from cooking.

By the time Cheol Gwang Woo entered the room, the food Bang Ye-in had prepared was already beautifully arranged on the table.

“Wow!”

Cheol Gwang Woo’s eyes widened.

The small table was filled with dishes.

Although he always traveled with Bang Ye-in, it was rare for her to prepare so much food at once.

“Come in.”

Bang Ye-in greeted him with a bright smile.

Cheol Dae-san gestured to an empty seat.

“Sit down.”

“Yes!”

“Is the repair clean?”

“Hehe! Of course. I fixed it perfectly, so don’t be surprised later.”

“Good job. Let’s eat.”

Cheol Dae-san patted Cheol Gwang Woo’s back.

Normally, a few hits from his palm would have broken bones, but Cheol Gwang Woo instead looked refreshed.

Bang Ye-in served food into their bowls with a broad smile.

“I’ve shown off my skills after a long time. Enjoy your meal.”

“I will eat well.”

“Thank you, miss!”

“Hehe!”

Lee Gwak and others began to eat, lifting their spoons.

‘Hmm!’

Lee Gwak’s eyes widened as he took a careful bite.

Bang Ye-in’s culinary skills had always been exceptional, but now they had reached a whole new level.

The moment the food touched his tongue, it seemed to melt and be absorbed directly into his body. Just one bite made him feel as if he had ingested a powerful elixir that revitalised his entire being.

“This is insane.”

Lee Gwak couldn’t help but look stunned.

Cheol Gwang-woo looked at Lee Gwak’s face with a mischievous glint in his eyes.

“It’s amazing, isn’t it? She’s completely out of this world.”

“I see.”

“Hehe!”

Cheol Gwang-woo grinned as if he himself had been complimented.

Thwack!

Cheol Dae-san slapped the back of Cheol Gwang-woo’s head.

“Enough already. Are you showing off already?”

For a normal person the slap would have been bone-crushing, but Cheol Gwang-woo just laughed and concentrated on his food again.

Cheol Dae-san shook his head.

“Tsk! You big, stupid bear.”

Although his words were harsh, his eyes were filled with affection as he looked at Cheol Gwang-woo.

Suddenly, Cheol Dae-san turned to Lee Gwak.

“By the way! I have some homemade plum wine; would you like some?”

“Sounds good.”

Before Lee Gwak could even finish his answer, Cheol Dae-san carefully picked up a small wine glass from the corner of the room.

He lifted the tightly sealed lid and a strong aroma of liquor filled the small room.

Lee Gwak couldn’t help but let out an exclamation.

“Excellent.”

“This batch turned out especially well. Drink up!”

Cheol Dae-san filled Lee Gwak’s cup to the brim.

“Me too!”

“I want some too.”

Cheol Gwang-woo and Bang Ye-in eagerly held out their cups.

“You bunch of alcoholics!”

Cheol Dae-san grumbled, but filled their cups as well, and finally filled his own.

“Cheers!”

He clinked glasses with Lee Gwak and the others.

Lee Gwak carefully took a sip.

A look of admiration immediately appeared on his face. The delicious scent of the wine lingered in his mouth.

It was more delicious than any wine he had ever tasted.

“This is extraordinary.”

“Isn’t it? Hahaha!”

Cheol Dae-san burst out laughing at Lee Gwak’s compliment.

The combination of good wine and delicious food naturally improved the atmosphere.

They casually inquired about each other’s well-being and shared what had happened in their lives.

Bang Yee-in had travelled the world collecting fine ingredients and researching new recipes, while Cheol Gwang Woo had honed his skills in the Vajra Demon Shadow Technique.

Thanks to this, Cheol Gwang Woo is no longer the uncontrollable madman he used to be.

Cheol Dae-san had closed his shop in Seige Fortress because the number of customers had dwindled due to the unofficial ceasefire between the Celestial Demon Troupe and the Jade Heaven Alliance.

With fewer customers, business had slowed, so he had moved to a busier area – Taegang, at the entrance to Dragon Heaven Valley.

“What about you, brother? How have you been?”

Cheol Gwang-woo asked with a curious expression.

He knew Lee Gwak had returned to Jianghu, but he wasn’t sure why.

Lee Gwak calmly explained his situation.

After hearing everything, Bang Ye-in let out a sigh.

“So that’s what happened. Are Sister and the children safe?”

“Yes.”

“Phew! That’s a relief.”

Bang Ye-in sighed as if it were her own family. She had been close to Han So-cheon when Lee Gwak’s family had lived together before retreating to Mount Qilian.

“So you think Brother Yi Cheon is in the Jade Heaven Alliance’s camp?”

“Yes. The information from the Hao Clan is reliable. The problem is that I don’t know exactly where he is.”

“I’ll keep my ears open and see what I can find out.”

“Thank you.”

“Hehe! It’s nothing.”

Cheol Gwang-woo scratched the back of his head in embarrassment, but his eyes were bright with joy.

He was happy to have met Lee Gwak by chance, and he was glad to be able to help him, even if only a little.

If it weren’t for Lee Gwak, he would have died long ago, consumed by his madness, and he would never have met Bang Ye-in.

Lee Gwak was his life-long benefactor.

For him, Cheol Gwang-woo would gladly give his life.

“Brother! Everything will work out”.
