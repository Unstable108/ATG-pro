Cheol Gwang Woo approached Lee Gwak with a question.

“Have you noticed the streets have become busier lately?”

Lee Gwak nodded his head in agreement.

Indeed, in recent days, the streets outside the Jade Heaven Alliance had noticeably filled with more people. Among them, a significant number were martial artists, armed with weapons.

“Brother Woo Gyeong said it’s because the Jade Heaven Alliance secretly sent invitations to the leaders of the ten sects. Their followers came in advance to do preparatory work before the leaders arrived. So many of the people we see on the streets now belong to the Ten Sects.

Having followed Nam Woo-Gyeong for a long time, Cheol Gwang Woo was quite knowledgeable about the Jianghu’s affairs.

He relayed to Lee Gwak the stories he had heard while accompanying Nam Woo-Gyeong. Thanks to this, Lee Gwak could keep up with the happenings in the Jianghu without much effort.

Suddenly, Lee Gwak stopped and looked at Cheol Gwang Woo, who scratched his head under Lee Gwak’s intense gaze.

“No, just thinking you’ve changed a lot.”

Instead of answering, Lee Gwak smiled and playfully slapped Cheol Gwang Woo’s arm.

Cheol Gwang-woo had changed significantly since following Nam Woo-Gyeong. He had completely controlled the madness that once consumed him and had gained a broader perspective of the world.

These days, Cheol Gwang Woo made it a point to read Buddhist scriptures every morning and evening. Perhaps because of this, he seemed calmer than before, which made him feel more reliable.

Lee Gwak’s trusting gaze made Cheol Gwang Woo laugh awkwardly.

Although he spent most of his time with Nam Woo-Gyeong, Cheol Gwang-woo still preferred Lee Gwak. Whenever he had free time, he would seek out Lee Gwak.

“Brother, I’ll treat you to a meal today.”

Lee Gwak looked puzzled, prompting Cheol Gwang Woo to show a bashful expression.

“Hehe! Brother Woo-Gyeong gave me my first salary.”

“Yes! He said he couldn’t make me work for free and took care of me.”

Pride filled Cheol Gwang Woo’s voice. It was the first time he had earned money through his work.

Lee Gwak seemed to understand Cheol Gwang Woo’s feelings.

“I heard there’s a decent restaurant by Dongting Lake.”

Cheol Gwang-woo led the way with his chest puffed out.

It was an amusing sight, but Lee Gwak followed him silently.

They entered a three-storey pavilion on a hill overlooking Dongting Lake. The sign read “Geumma Guest House” in bold, majestic letters.

Though called a Guest House, there were no rooms for guests to stay in; instead, the entire third floor was used as a restaurant.

Geumma Guesthouse, recently opened, had quickly gained fame for its delicious food and the stunning view of Dongting Lake, attracting crowds every day.

Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo had to wait a bit before they could find a seat on the second floor.

Cheol Gwang Woo couldn’t help but exclaim at the beautiful sight of Dongting Lake before him.

Although he often walked near Dongting Lake, he had only seen parts of it and had not realized how beautiful it was. Cheol Gwang Woo was utterly captivated by the view of the lake.

Lee Gwak, too, silently admired the landscape.

The endless horizon that could be mistaken for the sea and the white clouds created a breathtaking scene that naturally elicited admiration.

At that moment, a man cautiously approached Lee Gwak.

The vaguely familiar voice made Lee Gwak turn his head, revealing a familiar face.

“It is indeed you. I hesitated because I wasn’t sure.”

The person who grasped Lee Gwak’s hand was none other than Ahn Yu-san, the leader of Azure Maritime Company.

“How come you are here, Leader Ahn? Did you come with the Azure Maritime Company?”

“The Azure Maritime Company has been disbanded.”

“But worry not. Those who escaped with us from that Island are still thriving.”

Ahn Yu-san naturally took a seat next to Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak spoke to Cheol Gwang Woo.

“Introduce yourself. This is Leader Ahn Yu-san of the Azure Maritime Company, a person with whom I share a deep connection.”

“Pleased to meet you, Leader Ahn. My name is Cheol Gwang Woo.”

“Ha! Pleasure is mine. Master Cheol! I’m Ahn Yu-san. I appreciate your hospitality. May I join you for a while?”

Cheol Gwang Woo readily nodded.

“Thank you! In that case, allow me to treat you to today’s meal.”

“What? That’s not necessary. I was planning to pay for the meal.”

“Please, just this once, let me. I owe this gentleman a great debt.”

“Cough! Well, if that’s the case…”

Seeing Ahn Yu-san’s earnest expression, Cheol Gwang Woo had no choice but to relent.

Ahn Yu-san instructed the server to bring out the best dishes the Geumma Guesthouse had to offer.

After placing the order, Lee Gwak asked.

“What happened? Why did you disband the Azure Maritime Company?”

“Ah! How could I run a merchant group after experiencing that event? My heart just wasn’t in it anymore. So, I decided to dissolve it.”

“And how did you end up here? You said you had disbanded the group.”

“Somehow, the Myriad Merchant Troupe got wind of it and approached me. Since I wasn’t running my own merchant group, they asked if I could lend them a hand. Initially, I had no intention of joining, but then I thought it would be better to have Myriad Merchant Troupe’s protection to look after the remaining members and those we rescued from the Nine Shadows Fleet. So, I joined Myriad Merchant Troupe under the condition that they would offer protection.”

Lee Gwak nodded in understanding.

For Ahn Yu-san, who had lost most of his merchant group’s martial artists, seeking protection under the Myriad Merchant Troupe was the best course of action. Myriad Merchant Troupe, being one of the Ten Sects, had the power to provide such protection.

“I’m here on behalf of Myriad Merchant Troupe to carry out a major mission. I hope you understand that I cannot share more than that.”

Months had passed since they parted ways on that Island, but Lee Gwak had not changed at all.

On his way to the Jade Heaven Alliance, Ahn Yu-san had continuously heard rumors about Lee Gwak.

When he heard the name “Sura Lee Gwak,” he instinctively knew it was the same person he knew.

Ahn Yu-san had personally witnessed Lee Gwak’s martial prowess while facing the Nine Shadows Fleet on the Island. Naturally, he knew better than anyone how formidable Lee Gwak’s martial arts were.

So, when he heard that Lee Gwak had defeated Woo Mun-pae and killed Moon Gwang, he wasn’t surprised. He had that much faith in Lee Gwak.

Now, there was no one who didn’t know the nickname “Sura.” At least, among those who lived by the sword in the Jianghu.

Such was the extent of Lee Gwak’s fame, resounding loudly throughout the Jianghu.

Even with such acclaim, Lee Gwak remained unchanged from when they first met, which was characteristic of him and all the more reason to be glad.

While waiting for the food, Lee Gwak and Ahn Yu-san engaged in conversation, with Ahn Yu-san doing most of the talking.

He detailed how he had settled the affairs of the Azure Maritime Company, how he had distributed the assets to the families of the deceased martial artists, and how the women they had rescued from the Island were doing. Lee Gwak’s smile never left his face as he listened, finding some solace in these stories amidst the usually grim news.

Soon, their table was filled with dishes. Cheol Gwang Woo was astonished at the array of food filling the large table.

“Eat up, I’ll order more if it’s not enough. Today, Ahn Yu-san is covering everything.”

Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo began eating.

Ahn Yu-san, instead of eating, watched Lee Gwak with a pleased expression, grateful for the opportunity to repay him in some small way.

‘This person will undoubtedly become a renowned figure in the Jianghu.’

Even now, he had gained significant fame, but Ahn Yu-san was sure that Lee Gwak would grow into a giant, incomparable to his current self.

While Cheol Gwang Woo devoured his food hungrily, Lee Gwak ate slowly.

Someone cautiously approached Ahn Yu-san, whispering something in his ear.

“Understood. I’ll be right there.”

After the whisperer retreated carefully, Ahn Yu-san stood up.

“I would like to stay longer, but I need to enter the Jade Heaven Alliance and can’t stay any longer. If you tell me where you’re staying, I’ll come to visit.”

Lee Gwak gave Ahn Yu-san the location of his current residence.

Ahn Yu-san left with a satisfied smile, joining what appeared to be the Myriad Merchant Troupe’s martial artists as they left the guesthouse.

“From the Thousand Kingdom School to the Myriad Merchant Troupe, it seems all the Ten Sects are gathering in one place.”

Lee Gwak mumbled, holding a cup of liquor.

Nam Woo-Gyeong had once claimed that the Ten Sects would never gather in one place unless the sky fell. Yet, looking at the current situation, it seemed as if the sky was about to fall.

Somehow, the liquor tasted bitter.

‘It seems I’ll have to leave soon.’

Though he was reluctant to leave the house he had settled in, he couldn’t stay here aimlessly forever.

If he couldn’t find any information about Han So-cheon here, he had to move on.

That’s when Cheol Gwang Woo called out to him.

Turning his head, Lee Gwak saw Cheol Gwang Woo holding chicken legs in both hands.

“If you’re leaving, I’m going with you.”

“Your eyes, they had the look of someone about to leave.”

“You can read people’s eyes now?”

“Staying with Brother Woo-Gyeong might be better for you.”

“I sincerely follow you, Brother. It was you I trusted when I stepped into the Jianghu. So, if you leave, I’m leaving too.”

He might look like a bear, but he was sharp-witted. Lee Gwak couldn’t help but smile.

With a smile, Lee Gwak nodded.

“You promised. No leaving me behind.”

As the rustling of the bushes ceased, a little girl poked her head out. Panting heavily as if she had run a long distance, the girl was Lee Soo-ah.

Lee Soo-ah paused for a moment to catch her breath.

Her face bore signs of exhaustion, but she hardly felt tired due to the adrenaline pumping through her veins from the tension.

She had run all day since escaping from the White Light Sect.

It was a considerable distance for a child whose bones had not yet fully matured to travel alone. However, Lee Soo-ah didn’t stop for a moment and kept running to her destination.

Lee Soo-ah moved according to the plan Lee Cheong had laid out for her.

She had secretly hidden in the manure cart that came into the White Light Sect once every ten days. Even the bravest martial artists wouldn’t carefully inspect a cart filled with manure, making it the perfect escape.

After escaping the White Light Sect, she followed the path Lee Cheong had shown her.

Lee Soo-ah briefly recalled their conversation.

―Moving along the usual paths will get you caught quickly. So, you need to take them by surprise.

―There’s one escape route they would never expect. Even the White Light Sect’s trackers unconsciously avoid it… But, sister, you’ll have to take a much longer detour.

Her breathing had calmed down, and her complexion returned to normal.

Though young, Lee Soo-ah’s mastery of martial arts was not to be underestimated.

She employed the Three Yin Divine Blade to execute her qigong.

It was hard to believe such swift light qigong was performed by a child barely six years old.

‘I need to hurry to the Siege Fortress.’

The route Lee Cheong had indicated led to the Siege Fortress.

Siege Fortress was a fortress near the battlefield where the war between Celestial Demon Troupe and Jade Heaven Alliance had taken place a few years ago.

Though the war with Celestial Demon Troupe had reached a stalemate, Jade Heaven Alliance had not entirely let down its guard.

Jade Heaven Alliance had stationed forces at the Siege Fortress to prepare for any provocations from the Celestial Demon Troupe.

While the major war had ended, skirmishes between scouts from the Celestial Demon Troupe and Jade Heaven Alliance still occurred occasionally.

Most of these encounters ended as mere shows of force, but sometimes blood was spilled. Although not widely known in the Jianghu, many lives were still being lost.

Therefore, Siege Fortress was always on high alert, and ordinary martial artists extremely avoided approaching it.

This applied to the Ten Sects as well.

There was no reason for them to step into a place reeking of blood without necessity.

That’s why Lee Cheong had chosen Siege Fortress as Lee Soo-ah’s escape route.

―Jade Heaven Alliance regularly sends supplies and personnel to Siege Fortress. If you can accompany them back to Jade Heaven Alliance, you won’t have to worry about White Light Sect’s threats.

The look in Lee Cheong’s eyes when they parted was unforgettable.

It was as if he was bearing all the guilt in the world.

Lee Soo-ah muttered to herself.

“Don’t worry, Cheong. I’ll make it to the Siege Fortress just like you said, no matter what.”

Thus, the young girl’s perilous journey through the Jianghu began.
