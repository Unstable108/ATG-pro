Nine Dragons Clan, together with the Zealous Justice Clan, occupied the northernmost region of the Jianghu.

Unlike the Zealous Justice Clan, which was annihilated by Jade Heaven Alliance at the beginning of the war, the Nine Dragons Clan still firmly maintained its influence. In fact, they took advantage of the war to expand their power, even extending their influence into what used to be the Zealous Justice Clan’s territory.

Because of this, despite having destroyed the Zealous Justice Clan, the Jade Heaven Alliance was overshadowed by Nine Dragons Clan in the north and couldn’t exert much power there. A big reason for this was that the Jade Heaven Alliance was fighting wars across the entire Jianghu and couldn’t focus all its forces in the north.

“The current leader of Nine Dragons Clan, Gyeong Un-cheon, is exceptionally talented not only in martial arts but also in strategy. He skillfully exploited the weaknesses of the Jade Heaven Alliance and managed to expand his power even more. He even took in surviving disciples of the Zealous Justice Clan under his wing, thus pulling the hearts and minds of the northern people towards Nine Dragons Clan.”

“He’s quite a resourceful figure, it seems.”

“Yes, he is. And an exceptionally shrewd one as well. There’s even information suggesting that he has formed a partnership with the Myriad Merchant Troupe.”

“Myriad Merchant Troupe?”

Lee Gwak showed a puzzled expression.

In the early stages of the war, the Jade Heaven Alliance attacked the Myriad Merchant Troupe, aiming to seize its enormous capital, but the Myriad Merchant Troupe chose to disappear rather than resist directly.

All Jade Heaven Alliance got were the visible buildings and facilities; they were unable to seize any real assets.

The Myriad Merchant Troupe’s course of action was so drastic that initially, people laughed at them for giving up resistance and fleeing. But as time passed, they realized how wise Myriad Merchant Troupe’s decision had been.

The Myriad Merchant Troupe was a coalition of countless merchants, precisely as its name suggested. It was operated mainly by silver trade brokers, but its members included merchants from all over the world. Although some merchant groups under Myriad Merchant Troupe were plundered by the Jade Heaven Alliance, the damage to the entire Myriad Merchant Troupe was minimal.

Even hidden in the shadows, they continued to manage their merchant groups. As a result, even now, amidst the widespread war, they were earning enormous amounts of money.

The Jade Heaven Alliance sent its forces to root out the Myriad Merchant Troupe, but they still couldn’t discover the whereabouts of the Myriad Merchant Troupe’s leaders or members.

“Does this mean that the Nine Dragons Clan has joined forces with the Myriad Merchant Troupe?”

“I’m not sure if it’s a formal alliance, but we have identified signs that an enormous amount of funds from Myriad Merchant Troupe are flowing into the Nine Dragons Clan.”

“Hm!”

“Because of this, our young-master has taken direct action to find the truth. If the Nine Dragons Clan and Myriad Merchant Troupe truly have formed an alliance, it could change the entire balance of power in the Jianghu”

“Is the Nine Dragons Clan power that strong?”

“It’s not widely known, but the Nine Dragons Clan’s martial prowess is not far behind that of the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

“What?”

Lee Gwak found this hard to believe, prompting the branch leader to offer a bitter smile and explain.

“Most people would think the same as you, Master Lee. After all, the Jade Heaven Alliance’s forces are enormous. Indeed, when we look at the visible strength, the Jade Heaven Alliance is much stronger. That’s an indisputable fact.”

“So you’re saying that the hidden power of the Nine Dragons Clan is greater than what is visibly known?”

The branch leader answered Lee Gwak’s question with a question:

“Master Lee, do you by any chance know the origins of the Nine Dragons Clan?”

“To be honest, I don’t know.”

“The founder of Nine Dragons Clan, a hundred years ago, was Grandmaster Jin Mu-yeong, the Unmatched sword master. And Jin Mu-yeong was a direct disciple of Wudang. After the Great Heavenly Blood War ended, he led his followers to form a secular branch of Wudang. That was the beginning of the Nine Dragons Clan.”

“Wudang?”

“These days, Wudang does almost no external activities, so people have largely forgotten it, but Wudang is a famous sect with hundreds of years of history. A century ago, they were one of the Nine Great Sects, ruling the Jianghu alongside the Shaolin Temple. They have had nearly zero external activity for the last century, but their potential remains tremendous.”

A hundred years ago, after the Great Heavenly Blood War, Wudang closed its gates. They had suffered a critical blow from the Demonic Sect at the time.

The damage was so severe that it shook the very foundation of the Wudang sect, compelling them to withdraw and focus solely on rebuilding.

Nobody knew exactly how much power Wudang had regained over a hundred years. If it were a smaller sect, it might have faded over time, but Wudang had hundreds of years of accumulated strength and heritage. That kind of potential doesn’t disappear easily.

While they closed their gates to focus on rebuilding, it wasn’t as if Wudang completely neglected what was happening in the Jianghu.

“It’s not publicly known, but the Wudang and Nine Dragons Clan still maintain a deep friendship. We don’t know how much Wudang’s strength has been restored, but if the Nine Dragons Clan faces a crisis, Wudang will surely extend a helping hand.”

“You seem to hold Wudang in high regard.”

“Anyone who knows at least a little about Wudang will think the same. There’s a saying: ‘Even in ruin, wealth endures for three generations.’ And we’re talking about Wudang, a sect where supreme techniques pile up like mountains and whose wealth amassed over centuries is unmatched. If they lend such strength to the Nine Dragons Clan, even the Jade Heaven Alliance would struggle against them.”

Lee Gwak furrowed his brow.

Until now, he hadn’t given much thought to Wudang, dismissing it as an ancient, collapsed sect. But after hearing the branch leader’s explanation, he grasped the formidable power Wudang still wielded.

“So the Nine Dragons Clans is backed by the Wudang sect and has secured an enormous financial source in Myriad Merchant Troupe.”

“Yes, it’s the ideal combination of martial strength and financial power. That’s why our young master took it upon himself to act.”

“Hoo! So I need to go to the Nine Dragons Clan if I want to meet brother.”

Lee Gwak let out a quiet sigh.

Although he had done nothing wrong, the branch leader apologized:

“I’m sorry. You came all this way…”

“No, it’s all right.”

Lee Gwak shook his head.

The branch leader watched Lee Gwak for a moment before asking cautiously:

“You said you plan to go to the Nine Dragons Clan, right?”

“Yes! I will have to go there to see brother Woo-gyeong.”

“In that case, go to the port and find the Unsan Escort Agency.”

“Unsan Escort Agency?”

“According to reports, the Unsan Escort Agency is preparing for a journey to the Nine Dragons Clan at the request of a merchant group. I’m not sure what they’re transporting, but they seem uneasy with only internal personnel and are hiring additional martial artists.”

“If I get hired by the Unsan Escort Agency, I can easily reach the Nine Dragons Clan.”

“I will write a letter of recommendation for you. The head of Unsan Escort Agency, Nam Woo-chang, is an old friend of mine, so he won’t refuse.”

“Thank you for your consideration.”

At Lee Gwak’s thanks, the branch leader looked slightly embarrassed.

A martial artist of Lee Gwak’s caliber could afford to be arrogant.

In the Jianghu, where strength was law, someone with Lee Gwak’s skills would be respected no matter how prideful or indifferent he might be. Yet, he treated the branch leader with utmost courtesy.

‘Now I see why our young master cherishes him so much. Someone with such a character would definitely earn his respect.’

In the past, he didn’t understand why Nam Woo-gyeong cared so much for Lee Gwak, but meeting him in person made it clear. And so, he wanted to help in any way he could.

The branch leader wrote a recommendation letter on the spot and handed it to Lee Gwak.

“Thank you for the recommendation. I’ll be on my way now.”

Lee Gwak tucked the letter into his coat and stood.

The branch leader rose as well, looking somewhat regretful.

“I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help.”

“No, this is more than enough. I’ll look forward to meeting you again someday.”

“Please have a safe journey. When you see our Young Master, please pass along my regards as well.”

“Understood.”

Lee Gwak gave the branch leader a respectful bow and stepped outside.

“Father!”

Lee Cheong, who had been waiting, rushed over with a bright smile.

Lee Gwak ruffled Lee Cheong’s hair and spoke.

“Were you bored?”

“I was too busy thinking about martial arts to feel bored.”

“Really?”

“Yes!”

Lee Cheong nodded energetically.

Since the death of Cho Ryu-jin, Lee Cheong had become even more obsessed with martial arts.

He had always been incredibly focused, but now, he seemed to be immersed in training at every opportunity.

Lee Gwak left the Hao Clan’s branch with Lee Cheong and headed for Unsan Escort Agency

Finding the Unsan Escort Agency wasn’t difficult. Unsan Escort Agency was the largest escort bureau near lake Hong and had been in business in the same location for a remarkable 150 years.

Because of this, when the merchant guilds near Lake Hong needed to transport important goods, they would request the services of the Unsan Escort Agency.

When Lee Gwak presented the recommendation letter to the agency’s manager, he was hired without hesitation.

The leader of the Hao Clan branch was highly trusted by Nam Woo-chang, the master of Unsan Escort Agency, so anyone he recommended was accepted without question.

Lee Gwak used his alias “Lee Jin-mun.”

By now, his real name had become too well-known. The name “Lee Gwak” was synonymous with the fearsome reputation of Sura blade; anyone in the jianghu would immediately make the connection.

“We’ll be leaving at dawn tomorrow. Tonight, you can stay in the guest quarters. Come to the main training ground by early morning. Meals are served in the bureau’s dining hall.”

“Understood.”

Lee Gwak nodded in agreement.

The Unsan Escort Agency was famous for treating its escorts well. Once hired as an escort for Unsan Escort Agency, they provided lodging and a monthly salary of five silver nyangs. This alone was far better treatment compared to other escort agencies. On top of that, they provided clothing twice a year, in spring and winter.

Although there were countless escort agencies in the Jianghu, few provided treatment as generous as the Unsan Escort Agency. Because of that, there were even people who traveled from far away to become escorts for the Unsan Escort Agency.

Because of this, the escorts of Unsan Escort Agency took great pride in their positions.

On the way to the guest house, most of the escorts they encountered looked at Lee Gwak and other vagrants with disdainful expressions. Just looking at their faces was enough to see how proud they were of themselves.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong unpacked their belongings in the room assigned to them by the chief manager.

Normally, vagrants who signed short-term contracts like this were given a large room shared by six people, but the chief manager specially provided them with a small private room.

While it was partly because they considered that Lee Gwak was traveling with his son, the primary reason was the recommendation letter from the Hao Clan’s branch leader.

The branch leader did not give out recommendation letters to just anyone. He was rumored to have a very discerning eye, and the fact that he wrote a recommendation for Lee Gwak meant that Lee Gwak was a trustworthy martial artist. Additionally, the branch leader had indicated that Lee Gwak’s martial arts skills were strong, making him exactly the sort of talent the Unsan Escort Agency needed for the important task ahead.

Although the room was small, it was spacious for two people to sleep comfortably.

This was more than satisfactory.

“Let’s go eat now.”

“Yes!”

The two walked shoulder to shoulder toward the dining hall.

The Unsan Escort Agency had its own dining facility for its escorts. The cook was said to be very skilled, and each dish served was well-received by the escorts.

The dining hall was filled with escorts and vagrants who had been hired for this particular escort mission.

Lee Gwak scanned the crowded room, a little unsure where to sit. Most of the tables were full, and there didn’t seem to be any seats available.

“Dad! Over there…”

At that moment, Lee Cheong tugged on Lee Gwak’s sleeve and pointed to one spot.

While most tables had five or six people sitting at them, the table that Lee Cheong pointed to had four people.

Lee Gwak nodded and walked over to the table with empty seats.

As he approached, the people already seated looked up and watched him.

Lee Gwak folded his fists in courtesy and spoke:

“There are no empty seats elsewhere. May we sit here?”

“It’s an unoccupied seat, so feel free to sit.”

An elderly man, who appeared to be the oldest among them, answered with a smile.

The old man looked to be in his late fifties, with a face that appeared remarkably strong. The muscles on his forearms twitched like steel wires, making him look anything but an elderly man.

“Thank you.”

Lee Gwak bowed to the old man and sat down with Lee Cheong.

The old man looked at Lee Cheong with a curious expression.

“Out of everyone gathered here today, you’re the youngest guard. Or are you a vagrant? It’s a pleasure to meet you, child. My name is Seol Cheon-bok.”

“Hello, I’m Lee Cheong.”

“Lee Cheong? That’s a good name. So, are the two of you father and son?”

“Yes!”

Lee Cheong answered energetically.

Seol Cheon-bok’s smile grew even warmer.

“Greetings. My name is Lee… Jin-mun.”

“Nice to meet you, Master Lee. I’m Chae Il-yeon.”

The only woman among them greeted him with a lively expression.

Chae Il-yeon, a striking beauty in her early twenties, welcomed Lee Gwak and his son warmly.

Seated beside her was a man in his mid-forties who introduced himself with a cold, curt voice.

“Sung Jae-kyung.”

“Pleasure to meet you.”

Lee Gwak returned the greeting with another bow, though Sung Jae-gyeong merely nodded slightly, focusing on his meal.

The last person to greet him was a young martial artist who appeared to be in his late twenties to early thirties.

“Nice to meet you. My name is Dam Myeong. I look forward to working with you.”

“The pleasure is all mine.”

“It’s good to see someone close to my own age. Let’s get along during this escort mission.”

Dam Myeong also showed a friendly attitude towards Lee Cheong.

“Young brother, you’re the spitting image of your father. Glad to meet you! Let’s take care of each other on the way to Nine Dragons Clan.”

“Likewise, Dam Myeong.”

“I like your straightforward nature. You’re already growing on me.”

Dam Myeong chuckled lightly.

At that moment, Seol Cheon-bok spoke up.

“You all must be hungry. Let’s eat first. The food here is quite good.”

“Yes, sir!”

Lee Gwak answered and picked up his chopsticks.

He first served some food onto Lee Cheong’s plate before filling his own.

Just as Seol Cheon-bok had said, the food was excellent.

When Lee Gwak smiled in satisfaction, Chae Il-yeon’s eyes sparkled.

“Good, isn’t it?”

“It’s better than most inns I’ve been to.”

“Right? I was surprised.”

Chae Il-yeon beamed as if she had cooked the meal herself.

Seol Cheon-bok lifted a bottle of wine and shook it slightly.

“Care for a drink?”

“Why not?”

“Good choice. Once the Unsan Escort Agency begins an escort mission, they forbid drinking entirely. Today’s your last chance to enjoy it.”

“They must have strict rules.”

“That’s why they’re known as the best escort agency in the region. By enforcing such discipline, they earn trust. Here, take this.”

Seol Cheon-bok poured a full glass for Lee Gwak.

For a moment, the rippling surface of the wine seemed to reflect Cho Ryu-jin’s face.

‘Farewell.’

Lee Gwak downed the cup of wine in a single gulp.
