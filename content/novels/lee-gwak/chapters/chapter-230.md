Seo Jong-myeong furrowed his brows deeply.

Of the ten great sects, the White Light Sect was the most secretive. For this reason, Seo Jong-myeong had never liked them. The more secrets a sect had, the more suspicious they seemed. In the end, the White Light Sect only joined the war against the Celestial Demon Troupe at the last minute, just for show.

Because of this, the White Light Sect suffered minimal losses. In fact, after the war, they expanded their influence rapidly.

“What are you planning to do?”

“I have to save Cheong-ah and So-cheon.”

“But how? We’re talking about White Light Sect. They’re not just any sect, they’re one of the top Ten Sects. Their power is not something one person can face alone.”

“None of that matters to me. What’s important is that my child and my woman are there.”

Seo Jong-myeong couldn’t find any words to say in response to Lee Gwak’s resolute voice and determined gaze.

He realized that he couldn’t stop Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak was someone who had once pointed his blade at even the mighty Yong Cheon Myeong. There was no way a few words from him would change Lee Gwak’s mind.

Lee Gwak turned his gaze to Cheol Gwang Woo.

“I need you to make a request to the Hao Clan.”

“Track down So-cheon’s whereabouts. If we follow the trail of the assassins who targeted the leaders of the top Ten Sects, we should uncover something.”

“I ask you to handle the cleanup. White Light Sect must not know that Soo-ah met with me.”

Seo Jong-myeong answered with a firm expression.

Although usually more cautious than anyone else, when it came to matters involving So-cheon and Lee Cheong, he didn’t hesitate at all.

“Dad! I have something to tell you.”

Lee Soo-ah looked up at Lee Gwak as she spoke.

“Two of White Light Sect’s Four Heavenly Kings are targeting you.”

“Yes! That’s why Cheong-ah sent me. To warn you.”

“I see. So, you traveled all this way to tell me. Thank you.”

Lee Gwak patted Lee Soo-ah on the head, causing a happy smile to spread across her face.

It was a childlike expression.

Though she had been forced to act maturely, meeting the person she trusted most in the world allowed her to show a side of herself that only Lee Cheong and Han So-cheon had seen.

Lee Soo-ah sat on Lee Gwak’s lap, chattering away.

Her behavior was no different from any other child seeking their father’s affection.

Lee Gwak indulged her, but his gaze remained as cold and deep as ever. Seeing this, Cheol Gwang Woo shivered slightly.

For the first time, Cheol Gwang Woo felt a chill from Lee Gwak.

Since knowing him, this was the first time he had seen Lee Gwak so composed yet so terrifying.

Seo Jong-myeong’s face also grew rigid. He, too, sensed that something was amiss with Lee Gwak’s demeanor.

‘If things go wrong, there could be a bloody storm at the White Light Sect.’

The Lee Gwak he knew hated being entangled in grudges and avoided drawing attention to himself. Yet now, for the first time, he was clearly showing hostility towards someone.

Anyone who knew Lee Gwak even a little would understand how frightening this was.

“How sick is Cheong-ah? Is he really unwell?”

“He’s very sick. Without the Life Saving pills from White Light Sect, he wouldn’t survive a few days.”

“Whenever the Sect Leader orders Mom to do something, he always threatens her with the Life Saving pills. He says he won’t give it to her if she doesn’t obey.”

A conversation he had with Bang Ye-in came to mind.

At the time, he didn’t think much of it, but now, what Lee Cheong needed most was a physician.

His plan was to rescue Lee Cheong and Han So-cheon and take them to Lishan, where a physician resided.

That was Lee Gwak’s plan, but it would require a lot of preparation.

Fortunately, Lee Gwak was confident in such matters.

Seo Jong-myeong discreetly burned the Shadow Chasing Squad’s body and thoroughly erase any traces. Of course, this wouldn’t completely fool the White Light Sect, but it would buy some time.

That was all Lee Gwak had asked of Seo Jong-myeong.

“Are you sure you don’t need more help?”

“If you need more help, don’t hesitate to ask. I’ll do everything I can.”

“It’s not just words. If I don’t take care of my own, who will? No matter how well you do, you’re still my brother. You understand, right?”

Seo Jong-myeong also looked at him with a smile.

Next to Lee Gwak, Lee Soo-ah was holding his hand tightly, while Cheol Gwang Woo stood behind them like a protective wall.

“Take care! I hope for your success.”

Lee Gwak bid Seo Jong-myeong farewell.

Originally, he had planned to stay here for a few more days, but the situation had changed.

The White Light Sect would soon realize that the Shadow Chasing Squad was missing; they needed to reach the White Light Sect before that happened.

As they left, Lee Soo-ah spoke to the boy standing awkwardly behind Seo Jong-myeong.

The boy was none other than Gwan So-chu.

After hearing Lee Soo-ah’s story, Seo Jong-myeong had accepted Gwan So-chu into the Shadowless Squad. Although not yet a full member, he would start as an apprentice and gradually be trained in martial arts.

There were many with great talent, but few had strong willpower. In that sense, Gwan So-chu was definitely someone worth teaching.

As he watched Lee Soo-ah walking away with Lee Gwak, Gwan So-chu made a firm resolution.

‘Next time, I’ll protect you.’

It was a childish vow from a young boy, but his expression was firm, not childlike at all.

Whether she noticed Gwan So-chu’s gaze or not, Lee Soo-ah kept her eyes only on Lee Gwak.

Lee Soo-ah called out to Lee Gwak several times.

She didn’t have any particular reason or something important to say. She just loved the way the word “Dad” felt.

A smile filled Lee Soo-ah’s face as she looked at Lee Gwak. He smiled back at her warmly.

Behind them, Cheol Gwang Woo watched with envy.

‘I wish Soo-ah would smile at me like that too.’

Even to Cheol Gwang Woo, little Soo-ah seemed incredibly adorable. He wanted to get closer to her, but she was always stuck to Lee Gwak, so the opportunity rarely came. Still, they had a long journey ahead, so he consoled himself with the thought that there would be plenty of chances to bond.

Lee Soo-ah had many questions for Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak answered without showing any signs of annoyance.

Even when the questions were difficult to answer, he didn’t hide anything. At least with his child, he didn’t want to tell any lies.

He spoke about his life in the Jade Heaven Alliance, how he met Han So-cheon, and the events leading up to their separation in the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Tears welled up in Lee Soo-ah’s eyes.

She had always heard about her father from her mother, but she hadn’t known about the hardships he had endured or how tough his life had been.

Suddenly, Lee Soo-ah threw her arms around Lee Gwak’s neck, overwhelmed with emotion, and burst into tears.

Lee Gwak smiled and gently patted her back.

“Dad’s okay. So don’t cry, Soo-ah. Stop.”

Finally, Lee Soo-ah stopped crying, though her small face was streaked with tears. Lee Gwak wiped them away with his large hand, and only then did she smile brightly again.

Lee Soo-ah felt incredibly happy at this moment.

Until now, she had only imagined it.

What kind of person was her father?

She had imagined and drawn his face in her mind, but she was also scared. What if he was scarier than she imagined, or what if he treated her coldly?

Lee Gwak, her father, was even kinder and better than she had imagined.

She didn’t care if people thought she looked silly. She was just happy to be looking at her father’s face.

Holding Lee Soo-ah’s hand tightly, Lee Gwak continued walking.

He was happy to be with her, but part of him was also anxious. Thinking of Lee Cheong, who was alone, he couldn’t feel at ease.

‘Just hold on a little longer. I’ll definitely save you.’

The endlessly chattering Soo-ah beside him was adorable.

He regretted the years he had spent not knowing about such a precious existence. Thinking about how much Han So-cheon must have struggled to protect them made his heart ache.

Now, he had to be the one to protect them.

Lee Gwak vowed to never let go of Soo-ah’s small hand as he walked.

Though she was a child who liked to cling to her father, Soo-ah was also strong.

Despite the injuries inflicted by Yoon Sa-pyeong, she didn’t show any signs of pain throughout their journey. If anything, she tried to walk even more resolutely, so as not to worry Lee Gwak.

Although Lee Gwak suggested they take a break, Lee Soo-ah insisted she could keep going. But Lee Gwak shook his head.

“I understand how you feel, but it’s important to get enough rest.”

Soo-ah started to say something but then nodded.

In truth, she was very tired. She had kept up with Lee Gwak, hiding her exhaustion, but there wasn’t a part of her body that didn’t ache.

When Lee Gwak found a suitable spot, Cheol Gwang Woo lit a fire and set up a place for them to sleep. He also brought over a large rock and placed it near the fire.

Nodding, Lee Soo-ah sat on the rock Cheol Gwang Woo had brought.

After spending the day walking together, Lee Soo-ah had grown much closer to Cheol Gwang Woo. She called him “Uncle Bear” because he was as big as a bear. Each time she did, Cheol Gwang Woo would grin happily.

Cheol Gwang Woo tried to hide his smile as he spoke to Lee Gwak.

“Brother, I’ll prepare dinner.”

Cheol Gwang Woo chuckled and began preparing their meal.

Meanwhile, Lee Gwak checked Lee Soo-ah’s pulse. He intended to fully heal her internal injuries while Cheol Gwang Woo prepared dinner.

Though he had provided emergency treatment the day before, it wasn’t enough. If he didn’t take this chance to completely heal her, she would surely suffer even as she grew.

“From now on, you need to follow my lead and guide your qi, okay?”

“It might hurt a little. Can you bear it?”

Soo-ah answered without hesitation.

Lee Gwak looked at her with affection before carefully channeling his qi into her body.

As the foreign energy entered her, Lee Soo-ah frowned slightly.

When she had been unconscious, she had accepted it without resistance, but now that she was awake, she couldn’t help but feel it keenly. However, Soo-ah soon naturally accepted Lee Gwak’s qi.

“Close your eyes and follow my guidance as you circulate your qi.”

Lee Gwak’s qi flowed through her body without resistance. Gritting her teeth, Lee Soo-ah followed his lead in circulating her energy.

Seeing how well Lee Soo-ah was following along, Lee Gwak increased the intensity of his qi flow.

His qi stimulated Lee Soo-ah’s Three Yin Divine Qi. The intense external stimulation caused the Three Yin Divine Qi to surge.

The Three Yin Divine Qi swirled through her body, healing every corner it touched.

Lee Gwak carefully guided and observed the flow of the Three Yin Divine Qi, ensuring it didn’t stray off course.

As he watched and guided the Three Yin Divine Qi for some time, he began to grasp how to optimize its flow.

Without hesitation, Lee Gwak led the Three Yin Divine Qi through a new, more optimal pathway.
