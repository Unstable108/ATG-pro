Some people raise their voices or get angry when they encounter a situation they cannot understand.

Peng Sooyoon was such a person.

He strode forward and grabbed Dan Li Yeon’s shoulder.

“Miss Dan Li, I am Peng Sooyoon of the Thousand Kingdom School. I am disappointed. You ignored me for that insignificant… Ugh!”

At that moment, Peng Sooyoon’s hand that had grabbed Dan Li Yeon’s shoulder was flung away. The qi swirling around Dan Li Yeon’s body had reacted to the external stimulus.

Peng Sooyoon’s expression twisted. The pain in his palm was not ordinary.

Dan Li Yeon turned to look at Peng Sooyoon.

“Who… gave you permission to touch my body without permission?”

Regardless of being a woman, it was a long-standing taboo in the Jianghu to touch someone without permission. One could use techniques like poison or sneak attacks.

Moreover, Dan Li Yeon was one of the three disciples of the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Even if she did not harbor any personal grudges, her status meant she naturally had many enemies. Naturally, she had to react sensitively.

Faced with Dan Li Yeon’s sharp response, Peng Sooyoon showed a bewildered expression.

Her cold gaze made his body shrink involuntarily.

“I, I am of the Thousand Kingdom School…”

“I thought naturally you came to greet us…”

“Sigh! What do you think of me? How would I know where you came from and why would I greet you? Do I have a reason to?”

Peng Sooyoon stuttered without being able to give a proper answer.

It wasn’t just because of Dan Li Yeon’s sharp response.

Her gaze and aura had bound Peng Sooyoon’s soul. He had never encountered a young martial artist who exuded such a powerful presence since Namgung In, the invincible sword.

‘Even this lady of the Jade Heaven Alliance possesses such martial prowess?’

It seemed he was beginning to understand why the Jade Heaven Alliance was called the best under heaven.

At that moment, Namgung Yeonhwa, who had been silently observing the situation, approached Peng Sooyoon’s side and apologized.

“I am sorry, Miss Dan Li. I am Namgung Yeonhwa of the Thousand Kingdom School. Brother Peng was too hasty and committed a discourtesy. I will apologise on his behalf, so please calm your anger.

“Ha! I also overreacted. I apologize, Miss Namgung, but please understand that I am here today not because of the Thousand Kingdom School, but to speak with this person.”

Namgung Yeonhwa frowned slightly and looked at Lee Gwak.

She couldn’t understand why Dan Li Yeon was reacting this way to the stranger.

Although she had been curious due to his melancholic appearance, she could not discern anything special about him.

Dan Li Yeon, seeing Namgung Yeonhwa’s reaction, slightly shook her head and said,

“His name is Lee Gwa k, known by the nickname ‘Sura Blade.”

Only then did exclamations escape from the lips of the two people.

Although the name Lee Gwak was unfamiliar to them, they clearly remembered the nickname Sura Blade.

Sura Blade was such a powerful nickname.

It was not a nickname that a novice martial artist, newly arrived in the Jianghu, could earn.

Only then did Namgung Yeonhwa’s gaze change.

Her gaze, which had been mere curiosity until a moment ago, now contained admiration.

On the other hand, Peng Sooyoon’s face darkened with a sense of alertness.

Dan Li Yeon smirked at their contrasting reactions and said,

“I have urgent matters to discuss with this person, would you mind stepping back now?”

“Phew! I’m sorry, Miss Dan Li. I will apologize again for this rudeness later. I hope you have a good time.”

“Miss Dan said she has something to discuss with him. We can talk later.”

Eventually, Peng Sooyoon answered with a helpless expression.

Just before he walked away with Namgung Yeonhwa, he glanced at Lee Gwak and Dan Li-yeon.

‘To dare to humiliate me like this…’

Strength involuntarily surged into his fists, but there were too many onlookers around.

Peng Sooyoon reluctantly followed Namgung Yeonhwa.

Lee Gwak silently watched Peng Sooyoon’s retreating figure. Just by looking at his back, he could tell what he was thinking. Peng Sooyoon was easy to read.

“I’m sorry, Sir. Lee… no, Master Lee.”

Lee Gwak gently shook his head.

It was Peng Sooyoon who had committed the discourtesy. It was not for Dan Li Yeon to apologize.

“I came to ask you a favor, sorry for the sudden visit.”

Lee Gwak waited silently for her to speak.

“I’m sorry to say this, but I hope you won’t misunderstand. As you might already guess, the relationship between my brothers is not good right now.”

“Are you talking about a power struggle?”

“Yes! For now, Brother Yong is in a superior position, but Brother Woon hasn’t given up either. He is secretly gathering people who can be of help to him.”

He had previously received a recruitment proposal from Woon Dae-yeon.

“I have already declined his offer.”

“I know. I was there at the time.”

“Instead of trying to recruit you, he will try to recruit the people around you. Please, don’t let them get swept up in the power struggle.”

“Yes. I don’t want others to get swept up in their power struggle. It’s a problem that the two of them should solve.”

Lee Gwak expressed his gratitude for Dan Li Yeon’s kindness.

Dan Li Yeon glanced to the side. She could see Namgung Yeonhwa and Peng Sooyoon sneaking looks at them from another table.

They acted as if they weren’t interested, but they were all ears, trying to catch what was being said. Still, they wouldn’t be able to hear the conversation between the two.

From the moment she started talking to Lee Gwak, Dan Li Yeon had set up a Qi membrane to completely isolate them from the outside.

“Master Lee, you are now a person of interest. Now that they know your identity, they won’t leave you alone. Knowing that you’re not affiliated with the Jade Heaven Alliance, they’ll definitely try to recruit you. If not…”

“Are you talking about cutting the grass to remove the roots?”

“Right. There will definitely be attempts like that. In fact, some people who have entered here are trying to gather information to contact you. That’s why I wanted to tell you, if possible, to leave this place. Staying here could lead to troublesome situations.”

If Dan Li Yeon had gone out of her way to say this, it meant the undercurrents were not simple.

“Thank you for your advice, Miss Dan. I will consider it deeply.”

“Yes! And there are a few things I’d like to ask.”

“I’ve been unable to find any information on the whereabouts of Master Seo Jong Myeong. Do you happen to know where he might be?”

“Are you talking about Master Mu Young?”

Seo Jong Myeong was one of the few within the Jade Heaven Alliance who had treated him with genuine respect. Lee Gwak desperately wanted to see him.

After returning to the Jade Heaven Alliance, he had inquired about him but to no avail.

“If you’re looking for Master Seo, he’s probably in the Seige Fortress.”

The Seige Fortress was near the front lines where he had briefly stayed when dispatched as part of a diplomatic mission to the Celestial Demon Troupe.

“He couldn’t accept the ceasefire with the Celestial Demon Troupe. He protested, saying that this was not the way to achieve peace.”

“So, he was demoted for that?”

Anger tinged Lee Gwak’s voice.

He didn’t know what happened after meeting Gwang Noh-ya, but given his nature, Seo Jong-myeong would have led the fight against the Celestial Demon Troupe.

The idea that someone of his accomplishments could be demoted was unthinkable.

Dan Li Yeon sighed before continuing,

“Ah! It would be accurate to say he chose his demotion. He believed that the Celestial Demon Troupe would act up again and wanted to stay in the Seige Fortress.”

This time, Lee Gwak let out a deep sigh. It made sense to him.

Given Seo Jong Myeong’s character, it was entirely plausible.

His hatred for the Celestial Demon Troupe was so intense that it would burn him out like a candle before it faded.

“Yes. It’s a decision typical of him. Is there anything else you’d like to ask?”

“Is it possible to know the whereabouts of the Hidden Blood Squad?”

“Only the head of the alliance truly knows their whereabouts.”

“So, it’s impossible to know?”

“Fortunately, I am aware of the mission they are on.”

“They are tracking assassins. Recently, there have been incidents where key figures from the Ten Sects were assassinated. This caused an uproar within the Ten Sects, and the investigation was handed over to the Hidden Blood Squad. After all, who better to know assassins than assassins themselves.”

“So, they’re not within the Jade Heaven Alliance.”

Lee Gwak’s expression fell at Dan Li Yeon’s answer.

Everyone he had hoped to meet while staying in the Jade Heaven Alliance was not present. For Lee Gwak, there was no longer a reason to stay. However, he quickly composed himself and expressed his gratitude to Dan Li Yeon.

“I know it wasn’t easy to share such confidential information, thank you for answering so readily.”

Her gaze deepened as she looked at Lee Gwak.

When she first knew Lee Gwak, he was nothing more than an insignificant outer hall squad leader. Now, he had returned as a martial artist who could shake the Jianghu.

As far as she knew, no man had undergone such dramatic changes in such a short period.

Lee Gwak’s transformation was as radical as a caterpillar turning into a butterfly after breaking free from its cocoon.

Dan Li Yeon couldn’t take her eyes off Lee Gwak for a long while.

An elderly man, appearing to be in his seventies, visited the residence of Lee Soo-ah and Lee Cheong.

The white band tied around his forehead and his spotlessly clean white clothes indicated his significant obsession with cleanliness.

The old man’s name was Go San-ja.

In his youth, he was part of a Taoist sect, and he received the name Go San-ja there.

For some reason, he had left the Taoist sect long ago and had been living here since.

With an emotionless and cold gaze, Go San-ja looked at Lee Soo-ah and Lee Cheong and said,

“Master Noh Tae-tae wishes to see you after a long time.”

“Yes! Go and keep her company.”

“But Cheong is not in a good state of health. Can we postpone it?”

Go San-ja’s gaze turned towards Lee Cheong.

In truth, Lee Cheong was in the worst state of health. He had suffered from a high fever all day yesterday and had only just regained some strength. As a result, Lee Soo-ah was exhausted from tending to him.

Even though it must have been apparent from their complexion and expressions that they were tired, Go San-ja’s gaze remained icy cold.

‘No matter what I say, this man will not believe me.’

Go San-ja was a man of action, not one to lend an ear to someone’s circumstances.

Regardless of what she said, Go San-ja would surely carry out Master Noh Tae-tae’s orders.

Lee Cheong managed to swallow and responded,

Lee Cheong clenched his teeth and got up from his seat.

It didn’t matter what he said to someone who wouldn’t listen. So, Lee Cheong moved.

Lee Soo-ah supported Lee Cheong’s shoulder.

Just moving a little caused sweat to pour from Lee Cheong’s entire body, but he forced himself to stand.

Go San-ja led the way, and the two followed.

Lee Soo-ah whispered in Lee Cheong’s ear,

“I have to endure even if I’m not.”

Lee Soo-ah sighed at Lee Cheong’s stoic response.

Anger filled Lee Soo-ah’s eyes.

Anger towards Noh Tae-tae for forcibly summoning sick Lee Cheong, and anger towards Go San-ja for emotionlessly carrying out the orders.

Then Lee Cheong whispered in her ear,

“Smile! It’s the only way for us and mom to survive.”

Lee Soo-ah reluctantly responded and tried to smile.

Following Go San-ja, they walked for a while and arrived at a castle surrounded by dense green forests. The forests were blooming with rare flowers, filling the air with a heavy floral scent.

The castle, surrounded by flowers and also known as the Flower Castle, was none other than the White Light Sect.

Is this a mistranslation? Thanks
