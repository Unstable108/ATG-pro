The other name for Dragon Heaven Valley was Western Hegemon.

Being the closest to the Celestial Demon Troupe, Dragon Heaven Valley was always the first to confront the Celestial Demon Troupe whenever they decided to invade the Jianghu.

In fact, during the war with the Celestial Demon Troupe years ago, Dragon Heaven Valley, along with the Jade Heaven Alliance, suffered the most casualties. This had greatly depleted their resources.

The Dragon Heaven Valley was exhausted from rebuilding their forces, and just when it seemed they had recovered somewhat, another conflict with the Jade Heaven Alliance broke out.

They had secretly sent an envoy to negotiate peace with the Jade Heaven Alliance, but their proposal was flatly rejected, leading to the ongoing war.

The strength of Dragon Heaven Valley was no match for the Jade Heaven Alliance. Even though they were both members of the Ten Great Sects, the power of the Jade Heaven Alliance was far superior. The only reason Dragon Heaven Valley had been able to hold out so far was because they had formed an alliance with the Martial Sword Troupe to form a united front.

This alliance had allowed them to withstand the relentless onslaught of the Jade Heaven Alliance. The problem, however, was that the front lines of the war had become concentrated around Dragon Heaven Valley.

The pressure on Dragon Heaven Valley was immense. If they were pushed back even a little, they would suffer devastating losses, making their situation all the more desperate.

“Sigh.”

A beautiful woman sighed softly as she looked at the map hanging on the wall.

The woman exuded a mysterious aura, possessing both the freshness of someone in their twenties and the maturity of someone in their thirties.

Her name was Mok Seon-wol. She was the young master of Dragon Heaven Valley and one of the wisest people in all of Jianghu.

She had taken over the reins of Dragon Heaven Valley in place of her father, the Seven-Colored Martial Emperor, Mok Jin-myeong. The fact that she had managed to maintain an equal footing with the Jade Heaven Alliance on the battlefield was a testament to her remarkable abilities.

Mok Seon-wol’s face was filled with worry.

“The Jade Heaven Alliance is concentrating its forces here. If this keeps up, we’ll be in danger.”

The reason Dragon Heaven Valley had managed to hold out so far was not only because of their alliance with the Martial Sword Troupe but also because the Jade Heaven Alliance’s forces were spread across the Jianghu, preventing them from focusing their full strength on Dragon Heaven Valley.

But recently, for some unknown reasons, the Jade Heaven Alliance had begun to focus its forces here, making it harder and harder for the Dragon Heaven Valley to maintain their lines.

This was why Mok Seon-wol’s worries were deepening.

“We need a master. Not just someone average, but someone with absolute martial prowess…”

At that moment, a voice called from outside.

“Young Master, I’ve brought Elder Yang.”

A look of delight appeared on Mok Seon-wol’s previously worried face.

“Please, bring them in.”

“Yes!”

As the door opened, Lee Woon-sang entered, accompanied by Yang Soo-gon

and his granddaughter.

Mok Seon-wol smiled brightly at Yang Soo-gon

.

“Elder Yang! You’ve finally arrived.”

“It’s been a long time.”

Yang Soo-gon, along with Yang Hyes-so, approached Mok Seon-wol.

“Thank you so much for making the difficult journey.”

Mok Seon-wol’s face flushed slightly.

Yang Soo-gon’s real name was Yang Su Cheon.

In the Jianghu, he was known as the “Moon Shadow True Demon,” one of the Eight Great Martial artists.

He had visited the Dragon Heaven Valley a long time ago and taught a few moves to some of its disciples. Those students still called him Elder and followed him with great devotion. Mok Seon-wol herself had learned a technique from him.

While the depth of his martial prowess was unknown, his vast knowledge was nearly unmatched in Jianghu. However, he was a free spirit who disliked being tied down, so he rarely stayed in one place for long.

Mok Seon-wol had spent a great deal of effort to invite him, and today, she had finally succeeded.

In such chaotic times, having Yang Su Cheon on their side was an enormous relief.

Mok Seon-wol’s gaze then turned to Yang Hye-so.

“It’s been a while. You’ve become even more beautiful.”

“Unnie, you’ve become prettier too.”

Yang Hye-so smiled warmly at Mok Seon-wol.

Muk Seon-wol opened her arms and pulled Yang Hye-so into an embrace.

Considering Yang Hye-so’s normally shy nature, Muk Seon-wol was the only person she opened up to so much. It was because, back when Yang Hye-so was still very young, she’d spent much of her time with Muk Seon-wol and grown attached.

Muk Sun-wol and Yang Hye-so hugged each other for a while and savored each other’s warmth.

After a while, Muk Sun-wool looked at Yang Hye-soo’s face and asked.

Was the journey difficult?”

“Nope! I came with Grandpa, so it wasn’t hard at all.”

“That’s a relief. I’ve prepared the best accommodations for you, so you can rest comfortably there.”

“Will I get to see you often?”

“Of course!”

At Mok Seon-wol’s answer, Yang Hye-so beamed.

Yang Su-cheon watched the two with a pleased expression.

The reason he had brought Yang Hye-so to such a war-torn place like the Dragon Heaven Valley was precisely because of her bond with Muk Seon-wol.

He couldn’t think of anyone else in the world who would care for Yang Hye-so so wholeheartedly.

He could entrust Yang Hye-so to Mok Seon-wol with peace of mind.

Of course, there would be a price to pay for that.

Yang Su-cheon asked Mok Seon-wol, “What do you need me to do?”

＊＊＊

After a good night’s rest in a comfortable room, Lee Gwak woke up feeling energized.

After briefly checking his physical condition, he stepped outside. Since it was still early, there were no people in the first-floor dining area. Even the cooks hadn’t woken up yet.

Lee Gwak decided to skip breakfast at the inn and headed outside. Since it was before sunrise, there were hardly any people on the streets.

He walked alone for some time until he reached a fairly large river. Small fishing boats were preparing to leave from the docks.

Lee Gwak’s gaze was drawn to a large open clearing near the dock. People had already gathered there, spreading out mats.

Some were lying down on the mats, while others sat cross-legged with their eyes closed.

In front of them were signs with their prices written on them.

‘A vagrant market.’

Lee Gwak immediately recognized what this place was.

It was a market where mercenaries sold their martial skills.

Lee Gwak’s expression darkened slightly. The existence of a vagrant market itself wasn’t unusual, but the fact that one had opened here indicated that the situation wasn’t good.

Capable mercenaries didn’t normally need to sit around in these markets; they’d already be scouted or hired elsewhere. Usually only the duds remained, and among them, few were truly skilled.

Lee Gwak walked towards the mercenary market.

He didn’t care about the skill level of the mercenaries. What mattered was the information that circulated here. While Lee Gwak could visit a branch of the Hao Clan to gather information, the stories of mercenaries who had been on the battlefield were often more vivid and accurate.

As Lee Gwak entered the mercenary market, the mercenaries’ eyes turned toward him. They wondered if he might hire them. However, upon seeing his shabby attire and demeanor, they quickly lost interest.

They had a sense for these things.

People who were looking to hire or make requests had a certain air about them. To them, Lee Gwak was just another wandering mercenary, not someone who would pay for their services.

If Lee Gwak wasn’t a potential employer, they had no reason to pay attention to him.

They turned their attention away from him and continued boasting about their exploits.

“Damn it, I nearly got killed just a few days ago.”

“I’ve heard it’s rough out there. Is it really that bad?”

“Don’t even get me started. The Jade Heaven Alliance’s forces were like a swarm of ants, covering the ground as they advanced. It was mind-boggling.”

“It seems the Jade Heaven Alliance is determined to finish off the Dragon Heaven Valley for good. They’ve been concentrating their forces here more recently.”

“Hmm!”

The mood among the mercenaries was grim.

Although they were paid to take on dangerous missions, they naturally wanted to side with the winning team.

The danger was the same, but siding with the likely victor increased their chances of survival.

The mercenaries were deeply pessimistic about the current situation.

As Lee Gwak wandered through the market, he listened carefully to their conversations. Even the smallest detail could be a crucial clue for him. However, no matter how much he listened,

Lee Gwak couldn’t find out exactly where the Jade Heaven Alliance’s main forces were stationed.

But Lee Gwak wasn’t disappointed.

He hadn’t expected to learn everything in a single day. He had plenty of time, so even if it took a little longer, he was sure he’d eventually find what he was looking for.

As Lee Gwak walked through the market, he suddenly thought of Cheol Gwang-woo.

The first time Lee Gwak met Cheol Gwang-woo was also at a vagrant market. After leaving with Bang Ye-in, Lee Gwak hadn’t seen him since and wondered how he was doing.

‘I’m sure he’s doing all right.’

Lee Gwak thought that no news was good news and continued walking through the market.

The vagrant market was gradually coming to life. People looking to hire mercenaries began to arrive.

Mercenaries and employers haggled over prices.

Some were quickly hired, while others were left unchosen. It was a moment of joy and sorrow.

Those who were hired left the market like a receding tide, leaving only a few behind.

Lee Gwak still hadn’t obtained the information he wanted, and the vagrant market was beginning to wind down.

‘There’s no helping it.’

In this atmosphere, it was pointless to try to gather more information.

Lee Gwak turned his steps back toward the inn.

Just then—

“Are you a mercenary too?”

A cold voice suddenly called out from behind.

When Lee Gwak turned to look, he saw a man in his early thirties.

The man’s blunt nose gave him a rough appearance, but his sharp eyes made him look fiercely brave. Behind him stood about twenty martial artists.

Lee Gwak asked the man.

‘Are you speaking to me?’

“Who else is here right now? I don’t have time, so just tell me—are you a mercenary or not?”

“What if I am?”

“Tch! Why else would I come to a vagrant market? Of course, I’m here to hire someone.”

The man answered as if it were obvious.

Lee Gwak was about to refuse outright but changed his mind.

“If I’m hired, can I find out where we’re going?”

“You mean you’re going to pick and choose your assignments? Hey, you look like you’re new to being a mercenary, but you should know your place.”

The man’s subordinates burst into laughter at his words.

Though slightly offended, Lee Gwak didn’t show it.

“I am Lee Chi-sang, the leader of the Black Wind Squad. I’m in charge of contracting with Dragon Heaven Valley and transporting supplies to the front lines. We’re short on people because those who were supposed to join us broke their promise and didn’t show up. How about it, will you join us?”

“You’re asking me to come along without knowing my martial arts skills?”

“Hahaha! My friend, I don’t care about your martial arts skills. You just need to fill up the head count.”

“That’s right! We need to show the Dragon Heaven Valley that we have at least this much manpower so they’ll trust and hire us. You don’t have to do anything. No fighting. Just follow us. How about two nyangs of silver for three days?”

Finally, Lee Gwak understood why Lee Chi-sang had made him this offer.

The Dragon Heaven Valley alone didn’t have enough manpower to transport all their supplies to the front, so they hired mercenary bands like the Black Wind Squad for the job—it was cheaper and carried less risk.

The more people they had, the more they could charge Dragon Heaven Valley, which was why Lee Chi-sang had made the offer without even verifying Lee Gwak’s background.

After a moment of thought, Lee Gwak nodded.

“Alright. I’ll join.”

“Heh heh! Good decision. Do you think it’s easy to get two taels of silver for doing nothing? You wouldn’t get this kind of treatment anywhere but with our Black Wind Squad, so make sure you behave. By the way, what’s your name?”

“Lee Jin-mun.”

“Good! Lee Jin-mun, stand at the back and follow us.”

“Yes!”

Lee Gwak quietly took his place at the rear of the Black Wind Squad.

After that, Lee Chi-sang wandered around the vagrant market and hired a few more mercenaries. The mercenaries, who had been idling away the day with no work, gladly joined the Black Wind Squad.

“I thought today would be a bust, but I got lucky.”

“Same here. Getting hired by the Black Wind Squad? Guess my luck isn’t all bad today.”

“Heh heh! The Black Wind Squad is one of the top ten mercenary groups hired by Dragon Valley, isn’t it? If we do well this time, maybe they’ll hire us permanently.

“Don’t get your hopes up. Why would the Black Wind Squad want to hire the likes of us permanently? They’re probably just using us for this one job.”

The mercenaries who joined the Black Wind Squad chatted while keeping an eye on Lee Chi-sang.

From their conversation, Lee Gwak learned that the Black Wind Squad was quite a famous mercenary group in the area—and that there were many similar groups.

“If I go to the front lines myself, it’ll be a lot easier to find out where Brother Seok Yi-cheon might be.”

With that thought in mind, he followed the Black Wind Squad.

After picking up nine more men besides Lee Gwak, the Black Wind Squad made their way to a dock by the river.

Near the dock were four large warehouses used by Dragon Heaven Valley to store supplies for the front lines.

The supplies ranged from food, weapons, and even clothing.

In front of the warehouses, martial artists dispatched by Dragon Heaven Valley were distributing supplies to mercenary groups like the Black Wind Squad.

“The Blue Wolf Squad will transport supplies to the western military camp.”

“Understood.”

“The Soul Net Squad will transport supplies to the eastern Ochosan base in the east.”.

“Don’t worry about it.”

The leaders of the mercenary groups responded energetically as they received their assignments.

The mercenaries loaded their carts with supplies and set off for the frontlines. Finally, it was the Black Wind Squad’s turn.

The person in charge of distributing the supplies first counted the members of the Black Wind Squad.

“Thirty people? That’s cutting it close.”

“Heh heh! When has the Black Wind Squad ever failed to deliver supplies to the destination?”

“Still…”

“How about a little drink on me to ease those worries?”

Lee Chi-sang discreetly slipped a pouch of silver to the person in charge. Feeling the weight of the pouch, the man grinned and said, “Good! You’ll head to Hwangwon Plain.”

“Thank you.”

Lee Chi-sang smiled with satisfaction.

Hwangwon Plain was the closest frontline to Yongcheon Valley. The distance was short, and the situation there wasn’t too dangerous, making it the most preferred destination for mercenary groups.

Even with a few extra mediocre mercenaries, there was little risk.

“Let’s move out!”

The Black Wind Squad set off with over a dozen carts.
