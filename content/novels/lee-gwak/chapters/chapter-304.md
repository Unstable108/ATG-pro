When Gyeong Un-cheon opened the door to the guest room, he saw a middle-aged woman and a young girl seated on chairs.

The middle-aged woman was none other than Ja Seol-gyeong, the Unrivaled Lone Sword, and the girl was her disciple, Hong Chae-yeon.

As Gyeong Un-cheon stepped in, both Ja Seol-gyeong and Hong Chae-yeon rose from their seats.

“It’s been a long time, Lord Gyeong.”

“How did you come unannounced?”

“I happened to be passing by and heard that the Nine Dragons Clan was hosting a grand tournament, so I thought I’d drop in. I hope I’m not imposing.”

“Haha! Between us, there’s no such thing as imposing. Please, make yourself at home.”

Gyeong Un-cheon let out a hearty laugh. However, his eyes were sharper than ever.

Ja Seol-gyeong introduced her disciple to Gyeong Un-cheon.

“This child is my disciple, Hong Chae-yeon. Chae-yeon, greet him. This is Lord Gyeong Un-cheon, the supreme leader of the Nine Dragons Clan.”

“Disciple Hong Chae-yeon greets the supreme leader of the Nine Dragons Clan.”

Hong Chae-yeon bowed respectfully.

Gyeong Un-cheon couldn’t help but admire Hong Chae-yeon’s grace. She seemed to have inherited her master’s spirit entirely.

“Nice to meet you. It would have been better if you’d come a bit earlier.”

“Pardon?”

“If you’d participated in the martial arts tournament we’re hosting, your fame would have spread throughout the world.”

“I’m not interested in martial arts tournaments, so it’s alright.”

“Hmm! In that regard, you’re just like your master. Your master also wasn’t overly concerned with worldly fame. If your master had continued her activities, the history of the Jianghu might have been different.”

At Gyeong Un-cheon’s praise, Ja Seol-gyeong showed a slightly embarrassed expression.

“You’re flattering me, Lord Gyeong.”

“It’s not flattery; it’s the truth.”

Gyeong Un-cheon was not someone who generously offered compliments. In fact, he was exceedingly cold and calculating. Yet even he couldn’t help but acknowledge Ja Seol-gyeong.

She was indifferent to worldly fame, but Ja Seol-gyeong’s martial prowess was truly formidable.

Even Gyeong Un-cheon couldn’t easily guarantee victory against her.

“If only she would cooperate, we could challenge the Jade Heaven Alliance right now.”

Gyeong Un-cheon clicked his tongue. But he knew that Ja Seol-gyeong would never cooperate with him.

If the Nine Dragons Clan was a secular sect established under the full support of the Wudang Sect, then Ja Seol-gyeong was carrying on the legacy of the Mount Hua Sect.

Although both Wudang and Mount Hua had closed their doors now, a hundred years ago, the two sects had a great sense of rivalry.

Even though they had closed their gates, that sense of rivalry was still deeply rooted.

After gazing at Gyeong Un-cheon for a moment, Ja Seol-gyeong cautiously spoke.

“Would it be alright if we stayed at the Nine Dragons Clan during the martial arts tournament? I’d like to broaden this child’s horizons by letting her observe.”

“Haha! If you wish to stay, I will welcome you with open arms.”

“Thank you, Lord Gyeong.”

“Don’t mention it. Stay as long as you like.”

A subtle smile appeared on Gyeong Un-cheon’s lips.

While it was still impossible to gain Ja Seol-gyeong’s cooperation, he thought he might be able to persuade the young Hong Chae-yeon.

If he could bring her disciple to his side, perhaps he could also convince Ja Seol-gyeong.

“The Heavens are truly helping me”

It felt as if the energies of heaven and earth were converging upon him.

***

The Human Level Martial Arts Competition was reaching its climax.

By noon, half of the participants had been eliminated.

The remaining talented fighters took only a brief rest before entering the next round.

Lee Cheong stepped out of the tent for a moment to observe the gathered martial artists.

A hint of disappointment flashed across his face. Lee Gwak was nowhere to be seen. But he quickly shook his head and steadied his heart.

It would have been nice if Lee Gwak could watch his match, but right now, Lee Gwak was secretly searching for Nam Woo-gyeong.

The martial arts tournament would last for four days.

They had to find and rescue Nam Woo-gyeong within those four days.

Given the circumstances, Lee Gwak couldn’t watch Lee Cheong’s matches.

“Whew!”

Lee Cheong took a deep breath.

No trace of disappointment remained on his face.

Soon, he would have to step onto the stage once more.

As Lee Cheong was steeling himself and warming up, a cold voice sounded from behind.

“You’ve been fighting quite well.”

When he turned around, he saw a familiar face.

Looking down at him with an arrogant expression was none other than Nam Jin-woon.

Nam Jin-woon had also won his first match and was about to enter his second battle. Perhaps because he had easily secured victory, he appeared very confident.

Lee Cheong slightly bowed his head and spoke.

“Congratulations on your victory.”

“What’s there to congratulate about such a trivial thing? By the way, do you know?”

“Know what?”

“If we both win our next matches, the final battle today will be between you and me.”

“We’ll be fighting each other?”

“Exactly!”

Nam Jin-woon nodded.

“It would be better for you to just lose in this round. I don’t go easy on any opponent. If you face me, you’ll get seriously hurt. So it’s better not to come up.”

“So you’re telling me to lose on purpose.”

“I’m advising you because it’s in your best interest.”

“Sorry, but… I won’t take that advice.”

“You’ll regret it.”

“It’s better to regret after giving it my all than to give up without trying.”

“Hmph! You’re a stubborn kid. But remember this: on that stage, even your father can’t help you. Don’t come crying to Daddy later.”

“That won’t happen.”

Lee Cheong replied with a resolute expression.

His eyes glared intensely at Nam Jin-woon. Nam Jin-woon’s words had ignited a fire within his heart.

Until now, Lee Cheong hadn’t been eager to win the martial arts tournament. He just wanted to be of some help to Lee Gwak. But after hearing Nam Jin-woon’s disdainful remarks, defiance and determination welled up deep inside him.

Lee Cheong clenched his teeth and glared at Nam Jin-woon.

Nam Jin-woon sneered at him.

He already knew that Lee Cheong’s martial skills were above average.

Perhaps because he’d been cherished by his father from a young age and had properly learned martial arts, his achievements were notable.

“But he’s still just a kid.”

The difference in physique between the two was as vast as that between an adult and a child.

Lee Cheong’s strength and agility were far inferior to Nam Jin-woon’s due to his lack of maturity. Such a gap couldn’t be easily bridged with ordinary martial skills.

From the start, it was almost cheating for Nam Jin-woon to participate in the ‘Human’ level Martial Arts Tournament meant for those under fifteen.

Nam Jin-woon was confident of his victory.

He had vowed to win the ‘Human’ Grade Competition and advance to the finals. Once he reached the finals, even Lord Gyeong Un-cheon would have no choice but to take notice of him.

“Hahaha!”

Feeling pleased, Nam Jin-woon laughed heartily and turned away.

Clenching his small fists tightly, Lee Cheong watched Nam Jin-woon’s departing figure.

“I absolutely won’t lose.”

He now had a compelling reason to win.

Steeling himself, Lee Cheong prepared for his next match.

Soon, it was Lee Cheong’s turn.

When he ascended the stage, a boy named Ju Gwang-yeol was waiting for him.

At twelve years old, he was a head taller than Lee Cheong. Having practiced his family’s external martial arts since he was five, he boasted a sturdy physique.

Ju Gwang-yeol performed a respectful salute first.

His weapon was his two calloused fists. Despite his young age, his fists were hardened like iron, evidence of his rigorous training.

“Whew!”

Lee Cheong took a deep breath and gripped his wooden sword.

“Haah!”

Ju Gwang-yeol made the first move.

He charged at Lee Cheong like a raging bull.

Instead of dodging, Lee Cheong executed the first technique of the Eight Sects Sword Art,

“Mountain Splitting Slash”

Slash!

Ju Gwang-yeol leaned down and deflected Lee Cheong’s blade across his back. The wooden blade grazed him, causing his skin to flush red with pain, but Ju Gwang-yeol didn’t blink an eye.

The martial art Ju Gwang-yeol had mastered was the City-Destroying Six Harmonies Fist.

It was a fist technique boasting exceptionally fierce power, even among external martial arts.

The greatest characteristic of the City-Destroying Six Harmonies Fist was that it strengthened the muscles and bones firmly from a young age.

With a strong external defense capable of withstanding most attacks, its overwhelming destructive force ensured the annihilation of opponents.

Whoosh!

The first technique of the City-Destroying Six Harmonies Fist unleashed.

It was an incredibly powerful strike from a young boy.

Lee Cheong quickly used the Cloud Stride Art to evade Ju Gwang-yeol’s attack.

The Cloud Stride Art was something Lee Gwak had obtained from the Creation Pavilion when he was in the Jade Heaven Alliance.

The essence of the Cloud Stride Art was movement as free and ethereal as floating clouds.

Just like clouds that flow, scatter, and gather with the blowing wind, the Cloud Stride Art emphasized not resisting but following the flow.

Lee Cheong evaded Ju Gwang-yeol’s attacks by entrusting his body to the flow.

“How long can you keep dodging?”

Whoosh!

Ju Gwang-yeol’s eyes flashed fiercely.

“One hit is all it takes.”

He pushed Lee Cheong harder and harder.

Ju Gwang-yeol’s City-Destroying Six Harmonies Fist consisted of straight-line, powerful techniques that were exhilarating to watch.

“Wow!”

“Truly amazing!”

People cheered at Ju Gwang-yeol’s thrilling attacks. After all, it was enjoyable to watch.

While most people focused on Ju Gwang-yeol, a few paid attention to Lee Cheong instead.

“Impressive. To deflect Ju Gwang-yeol’s fierce techniques like that.”

“Could that footwork be the Cloud Stride Art? It’s delicate footwork, not easy for a child to perform skillfully.”

“Seems defeating So Hyun-seol wasn’t merely due to luck.”

They observed Lee Cheong’s movements with sharp gazes.

Lee Cheong’s face was flushed.

Ju Gwang-yeol was like a wild ox.

His reckless fighting style, not caring for his own body, was something Lee Cheong was experiencing for the first time. It was both fascinating and enjoyable.

While evading with the Cloud Stride Art, Lee Cheong counterattacked using the Eight Sects Sword Art.

Swish, swish!

He mainly used “Mountain Splitting Slash” and “Raging Tidal Force”

“Ugh!”

Ju Gwang-yeol’s expression twisted slightly.

Lee Cheong’s counterattack was fiercer than he had expected.

The City-Destroying Six Harmonies Fist consumed immense internal energy proportional to its sheer power. Because of that, Ju Gwang-yeol’s internal energy was already running low.

“You rat-like brat!”

He let out an angry shout.

Lee Cheong’s elusive movements stoked his anger. However, Lee Cheong remained calm.

Lee Gwak had taught him that excitement was forbidden in any situation.

“Keep your heart hot, but your head cool…”

Lee Cheong tried to follow Lee Gwak’s teachings.

At that moment, a flaw in Ju Gwang-yeol’s defense caught Lee Cheong’s eye. His movements had faltered due to his nearly depleted internal energy.

Seizing the opportunity, Lee Cheong used the third technique of the Eight Sects Sword Art:

“Shadowless Strike”

“Gah!”

As Ju Gwang-yeol’s eyes widened, Lee Cheong’s wooden sword struck his chest.

Bang!

With a loud noise, Ju Gwang-yeol was sent flying backward.

The attack was so powerful that the wooden sword shattered upon impact with his chest.

Ju Gwang-yeol collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath. The intense shock made it difficult to even breathe.

Lee Cheong approached and gently pressed his palm on Ju Gwang-yeol’s solar plexus. Suddenly, breathing became much easier.

“Th-thank you.”

Ju Gwan-gyeol forgot his defeat and expressed gratitude.

Lee Cheong smiled gently.

“It was a good match, brother!”

“You are truly amazing. It’s my complete defeat.”

“I was lucky.”

“I hope you win the championship so that my loss to you won’t be in vain.”

“Thank you, brother! Take care as you go down.”

After cupping his fists to Ju Gwang-yeol, Lee Cheong stepped down from the stage.

The gathered martial artists murmured as they watched him.

“That kid is quite something.”

“Indeed! He’s showing real potential.”

“I’m looking forward to his next match.”

It was a very different reaction from when he fought So Hyun-seol. The martial artists’ gazes had turned favorable.

Many began to pay attention to Lee Cheong.

Among them were Ja Seol-gyeong, the Unrivaled Lone Sword, and her disciple, Hong Chae-yeon.

“That child is his son.”

Ja Seol-gyeong’s eyes sparkled.

Though she was far away, she immediately recognized Lee Cheong’s identity.

She knew that Lee Cheong’s father was Lee Gwak. The fact that Lee Gwak was using the alias Lee Jin-mun wasn’t particularly important.

What mattered to her was that the martial talent Lee Cheong displayed was extraordinary.

Ja Seol-gyeong asked Hong Chae-yeon, “What do you think?”

“He’s quite good.”

Hong Chae-yeon was clenching her small fists tightly.

Her reaction clearly showed competitive spirit.

Ja Seol-gyeong was slightly surprised.

“Oh! That child has stirred up Chae-yeon’s competitive spirit?”

The fact that Hong Chae-yeon displayed this much emotion was itself surprising.

Ja Seol-gyeong smiled gently.

“That’s good!”
