For the past few days, Lee Gwak had secluded himself in his room.

The duel with Moon Gwang had left Lee Gwak with significant internal injuries and enlightenment simultaneously.

Moon Gwang was a master close to reaching the ultimate realm.

His unique style of martial arts, “Heavenly Divine Force,” contained the subtlety of penetration techniques. Because of this, if one only focused on responding to external force, they would unknowingly suffer internal injuries.

Lee Gwak had never heard of or experienced such a method of internal energy management, which led to his injuries.

Lee Gwak blamed his complacency.

He had been fighting Gwang Noh ya for six years. Initially, he sustained many injuries, but as time went on, he became accustomed to fighting Gwang Noh ya, and the injuries significantly decreased.

Having harshly trained in martial arts from Gwang Noh ya, who could be considered the best in the world, Lee Gwak unconsciously developed a habit of looking down on other martial artists. That’s why he suffered internal injuries. He had underestimated Moon Gwang…

‘I’ve unknowingly picked up a bad habit.’

The past few days were spent treating his internal injuries and reflecting on his complacency. During this time in his room, no one entered. Not Nam Woo Gyeong and not even Cheol Gwang Woo.

“You’re out. Are you feeling alright?”

“Brother!”

The first to greet Lee Gwak when he came out were Nam Woo Gyeong and Cheol Gwang Woo.

“I’m fine.”

“That’s a relief. I was worried you might have suffered severe internal injuries.”

“I had a lot to think about.”

“Have you finished sorting it all out?”

“Well done.”

Nam Woo Gyeong patted Lee Gwak on the shoulder.

Lee Gwak’s gaze turned towards Cheol Gwang Woo.

Cheol Gwang Woo’s face seemed somewhat gentler. Sensing Lee Gwak’s thoughts, Nam Woo Gyeong explained.

“That guy, he’s been reading nothing but Buddhist scriptures while you’ve been in your room. I don’t know if he’s thinking about shaving his head and joining a monastery or not.

“Ah! It’s not like that. I just found a bit of peace of mind.”

“If you ever want to join a monastery, just tell me. I’ll shave your head for you. Heh!”

“There’s no need for that.”

Cheol Gwang Woo backed away from Nam Woo Gyeong with a disgusted expression.

Nam Woo Gyeong chuckled and said to Lee Gwak,

“Since you haven’t eaten properly for a while, let’s start with a meal. Innkeeper, please bring us some good food.”

The innkeeper’s response came from the kitchen.

Lee Gwak willingly sat down on a chair. Indeed, he had been eating poorly and felt empty inside.

Nam Woo Gyeong sat down in front of Lee Gwak and said,

“The Jianghu is in an uproar because of you, yet the main character himself is at ease.”

“An uproar?”

“Heh! Don’t even mention it, brother. Now, in the current Jianghu, there’s no one who doesn’t know the nickname ‘Sura’. Go out on the streets, and you’ll hear it so much you’ll get earwax build-up.”

Cheol Gwang Woo excitedly spat as he spoke.

Hearing all this, Lee Gwak calmly responded,

“Is that all you have to say? Brother, do you realize how great that is?”

Cheol Gwang Woo got excited again.

His face turned so red it looked like it might burst at any moment. Seeing this, Nam Woo Gyeong calmed Cheol Gwang Woo down.

“That’s enough.”

“But, brother…”

“You don’t need to say it. Gwak knows. The power that fame brings in the Jianghu, right?”

Lee Gwak silently nodded.

Gaining fame in the Jianghu wasn’t always a good thing, but a certain level of renown was necessary to solidify one’s standing in the Jianghu.

Especially for a lone martial artist like Lee Gwak, greater fame was even more crucial.

Although the nickname ‘Sura’ wasn’t exactly welcome, Lee Gwak decided to accept it willingly.

Suddenly remembering something, Lee Gwak asked,

“By the way, how has the White Light Sect reacted?”

“Heh! With rumors so rampant in the Jianghu, what can they do? Don’t worry. There won’t be any movement from them for a while.”

“It would actually be better for us if they did make a move. It would be an opportunity to understand what kind of information Moon Gwang was after. But if they have any sense, they won’t do that. It would be far more effective for them to conceal the information rather than rashly confronting you.”

Nam Woo Gyeong’s eyes shone sharply.

During the time Lee Gwak was staying in his room, Nam Woo Gyeong was the one who moved most busily.

He used the Hao Clan to amplify Lee Gwak’s rumors while keeping a close watch on the White Light Sect’s movements. However, strangely enough, there had been no activity from the White Light Sect over the past few days.

‘They’re probably being cautious due to the public’s attention for now, but they won’t be able to hold back forever.’

Until then, Nam Woo Gyeong planned to wait and see patiently.

He prided himself on his patience, second to none.

“You’ve waited a long time.”

The voice of the innkeeper broke Nam Woo Gyeong’s train of thought.

Nam Woo Gyeong looked up to see the innkeeper bringing a tray full of food.

“That’s a lot…”

“Our guest deserves at least this much for staying at our inn. Heh! Don’t worry about the money, please eat as much as you like. If it’s not enough, I’ll bring more.”

The innkeeper said, smiling as he set down the food.

The inn had gained fame as the place where the martial artist who defeated the Moon Gwang was staying. The number of people who visited the inn to see Lee Gwak during his stay was beyond count.

Thanks to this, the inn enjoyed a tremendous boom.

At this moment, every seat in the dining area was taken. People were glancing around, looking for an opportunity to speak to Lee Gwak. However, they were intimidated by Cheol Gwang Woo’s enormous presence and didn’t dare to act rashly.

Amid everyone’s attention, Lee Gwak quietly maneuvered his chopsticks. *** Within the Jade Heaven Alliance, a carriage bearing the insignia of the secret court made its entrance.

A small flag symbolizing the secret court fluttered on the roof of the carriage. The moment it approached the outer gate, the martial artists guarding the entrance tensed up.

Regardless of rank or status, it was a policy of the Jade Heaven Alliance that anyone entering the Alliance had to have their identity checked. However, high-ranking officials often found the inspection bothersome or unwelcome, leading to frequent problems.

Although inspection procedures had recently been relaxed, the carriage still had to be stopped for inspection.

“Please stop.”

The outer hall martial artists halted the carriage.

The carriage, belonging to the Secret Court, obediently stopped in front of them.

The leader of the outer hall approached the carriage and asked,

“Please state your affiliation and identity.”

“I am Gong Chang-seong, affiliated with the Little Hall of the Secret Court.”

The coachman looked down and responded.

Hearing the coachman mention Little Hall, an intelligence organization operating within the Secret Court, the leader’s expression changed. Given the nature of handling intelligence, their operations were mostly conducted in secrecy.

The leader’s voice became noticeably more cautious.

“And who is in the carriage?”

“Master Lim Ji Moon is inside.”

“What! The Jade Dragon…”

The leader was taken aback.

The Jade Dragon was a nickname recently gained by a young swordsman known throughout the Jianghu.

His face was as beautiful as jade, and his bravery was likened to that of a dragon, hence the nickname.

It was rare for someone of a young age to earn such a title, but Jade Dragon was an exception, noted for his exceptional martial skills and good looks.

The leader asked cautiously,

“May I verify the face?”

With a slight movement, the carriage window opened, revealing the handsome face of a young man in his late teens.

The leader involuntarily let out an exclamation of admiration. Even a man couldn’t help but be amazed by the youth’s good looks.

He was indeed the Jade Dragon, Lim Ji Moon.

Lim Ji Moon asked the leader,

“May I enter? My sister is waiting inside.”

“Of course.”

The leader’s expression changed.

It was not just anyone who called him, but a member of the Little Hall, the intelligence arm of the Secret Court. With Yeo Joong Wol limiting his outside activities, his presence had become even more important. Offending the future heir to the Secret Court was the last thing the leader wanted, so he quickly shouted,

The gate opened, and the carriage entered the Jade Heaven Alliance.

After passing through the outer gate, the carriage swiftly made its way to the inner gate and arrived at the Secret Court’s location.

Finally, Lim Ji Moon let out a sigh of relief and opened the carriage door. Stepping out first, he held the door open and said,

“We’ve arrived. Please, come out.”

“Hmm! We’ve finally arrived.”

Then, someone emerged from inside the carriage.

It was an old man with a large hat pressed down over his face, completely concealing his features. A proud look appeared on Lim Ji Moon’s face as he looked at the old man.

The old man was O Se-ui.

Lim Ji Moon had personally taken action to bring O Se-ui, who had defected from White the Light Sect, to this place.

Using the Shenyang Escort Service as a decoy, O Se-ui barely made it to the rendezvous with the Secret Court. The Secret Court had moved meticulously behind the scenes to safely bring O Se-ui here.

False information was leaked, and routes were manipulated to shake off any pursuers.

Lim Ji Moon had overseen the entire operation.

Lim Ji Moon was not just a martial artist of exceptional strength.

He was a child prodigy, trained in the arts of intelligence and espionage by his sister, Lim Sobo. Naturally, he had the ability to perform such tasks better than anyone else. And he did not disappoint Lim Sobo’s expectations, successfully completing his mission.

By bringing O Se-ui to the Secret Court, his task was deemed complete.

As Lim Ji Moon and O Se-ui stepped out, personnel from the Secret Court approached.

“Master Lim, you’ve worked hard. From here on, the Little Hall will take over.”

The man speaking was Tak YI cheon, the head of the Little Hall, overseeing the Secret Court’s information.

Lim Ji Moon nodded and replied,

“I’m tired from the long journey. Please, accommodate him in the guest house for today. I’ll go and report to my sister.”

“Please do.”

Tak YI cheon smiled warmly, proud of Lim Ji Moon for safely bringing O Se-ui this far.

Lim Ji Moon then said to O Se-ui,

“Please, rest in the guest house, elder. They will ensure your stay is comfortable.”

“Heh! Then, let’s see how well the Jade Heaven Alliance treats its guests.”

With a sinister smile, O Se-ui removed his hat, revealing a face that resembled a rat.

He said to Tak YI cheon,

“The guest house is secure, right?”

“Do not worry. It’s among the safest places in the Jade Heaven Alliance, protected by triple layers of guards and mechanical traps. Without the Secret Court’s permission, no one can enter.”

“Heh! It should be. If they want the information in my head. You’ve prepared the payment, right?”

“Of course. If you provide the information, we will ensure you can live comfortably under a new identity, undetectable by anyone. Of course, financial compensation has also been prepared.”

O Se-ui nodded, satisfied.

Tak YI cheon and the Secret Court’s guards escorted O Se-ui to the guest house. Watching them for a moment, Lim Ji Moon then headed to report the situation to his sister, Lim Sobo.

“Ah, Sister! This was tough. With this much done, even you should acknowledge it, right?”

A refreshing smile appeared on Lim Ji Moon’s lips.

It was a smile that had thrilled the hearts of numerous female warriors across the Jianghu.

Thinking back, it was a miracle that he had safely brought O Se-ui here.

The situation was filled with countless variables, making it difficult to predict what would happen next. That’s why he had been tense throughout the journey.

Lim Ji Moon wanted to report to Lim Sobo and then rest. Naturally, his steps quickened.

“Assassins!”

“Damn it!”

Suddenly, commotion erupted in the direction where Tak YI cheon and the others had disappeared.

Lim Ji Moon’s expression changed drastically.

‘An assassination? Could it be…’

He quickly darted towards the source of the noise.

Soon, he saw Tak YI cheon and others holding someone in their arms.

“Master Lim!”

Tak YI cheon looked desperately at Lim Ji Moon.

Lim Ji Moon quickly asked,

“What happened?”

“An assassin. They struck without a sound, taking his life.”

The person in Tak YI cheon’s arms was O Se-ui. A fine cut was visible on his neck. The wound was not large, so there wasn’t much blood.

That small wound had taken O Se-ui’s life.

It was a chillingly precise and ingenious method of killing.

Such a technique, which used minimal force to sever a critical meridian and take a life, was something Lim Ji Moon had never seen before.

O Se-ui had already rolled his eyes back, clearly beyond saving, even by the most skilled healers.

Lim Ji Moon asked Tak YI cheon,

“Where did the assassin disappear to?”

“Over there.”

Tak YI cheon raised his hand to point in a certain direction.

Lim Ji Moon clenched his teeth and propelled himself towards the direction the assassin had vanished.

‘I let my guard down just because we arrived at the Secret Court.’

The assassin had seized the one moment when everyone was off guard.

It was a chilling display of determination and execution.

‘I must catch him and uncover who is behind this.’

This was not just any place but the Jade Heaven Alliance, and within it, the Secret Court, known for its stringent security. He had to catch the assassin to figure out how they infiltrated the network.

If the assassin got away now, such incidents could happen again.

Lim Ji Moon exerted full energy into his qigong.

A faint black shadow was visible in the distance.
