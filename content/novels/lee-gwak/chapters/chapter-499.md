He lost count of how many times he had swung his blade.

Lost in a trance-like state, he’d lost all sense of time.

Lee Gwak’s entire body was now drenched in sweat.

The same was true for Go Geom-wol.

Beads of sweat streamed relentlessly down his flushed face.

Not only his clothes, but even his hair was soaked with sweat.

At their level, their internal energy circulated on its own, and when depleted, they drew in external energy to replenish themselves.

Their bodies maintained peak condition, allowing them to fight for three days and nights without rest.

Though their forms were human, what resided within them had long transcended humanity.

Yet these two individuals were now tired and breathing heavily.

That’s how fierce their battle had been.

They poured everything they had built up until now into this single fight. Still, the outcome remained undecided.

The area had long been reduced to ruins.

As if a volcano had erupted, a giant crater formed around the spot where the two had clashed.

The martial artists of the Celestial Demon Troupe and the Heavenly Justice Alliance could only stare with their mouths agape, unable to do anything.

Kwa-rurur!

Thunder rumbled in the cloudless sky.

The clash between Lee Gwak and Go Geom-wol had even disrupted the flow of the heavenly forces.

“How can that be a battle between humans?”

“Those two have already transcended humanity.”

The martial artists trembled.

The martial prowess displayed by Lee Gwak and Go Geom-wol was beyond imagination.

It evoked not just awe, but also palpable fear.

“Hoo!”

Go Geom-wol regulated his disturbed energy and took a deep breath.

Lee Gwak was in the same state.

His seemingly infinite internal energy was completely depleted, and as he drew on external energy, his energy became naturally impure.

Normally, this level of impurity wouldn’t be a problem, as it was more than enough to handle most masters.

But his opponent was Go Geom-wol.

The man who had earned the nickname ‘Nine Realms Divine Demon’ through this war.

One of the few truly perfect warriors in the Jianghu.

Fighting with impure qi against such an opponent was a perilous disadvantage.

I have to end this in one strike.

Lee Gwak gripped his blade tighter.

Go Geom-wol did the same.

Lee Gwak was a perfect opponent.

Though he had always suspected as much, facing Lee Gwak directly far surpassed his expectations.

His hand ached from the clash. One more blow of that magnitude and his arm might fail altogether.

He couldn’t remember the last time he had fought with such abandon. That alone proved Lee Gwak’s worth.

Go Geom-wol suddenly remembered the first time they met.

Back then, Lee Gwak was only a promising martial artist.

Go Geom-wol had foreseen the day Lee Gwak might become his equal, but he never thought it would happen so quickly.

In many ways, Lee Gwak was an astonishing existence.

A look of respect appeared in Go Geom-wol’s eyes as he looked at Lee Gwak.

Just as Lee Gwak held Go Geom-wol in high regard, Go Geom-wol also thought highly of Lee Gwak.

Suddenly, Go Geom-wol spoke.

“It seems this next attack will be my last.”

“I believe the same for myself.”

Lee Gwak answered honestly.

Revealing one’s weakness to an opponent was clearly a foolish act. But the two, who had clashed with all their might, understood each other’s capabilities and limits better than anyone else.

Perhaps even better than they knew themselves.

Lies or bluffs wouldn’t work on such an opponent. And he didn’t want to deceive him either.

Go Geom-wol looked up at the sky for a moment.

Lee Gwak couldn’t say anything, seeing his appearance as if he were conversing with the heavens.

Lee Gwak gazed intently at Go Geom-wol.

It didn’t seem strange to him even if Go Geom-wol were truly talking to the heavens. From the moment they first met, Go Geom-wol had seemed to be above the heavens.

Lee Gwak had merely followed, watching his back.

To Lee Gwak, Go Geom-wol was more than just a rival.

Looking back, most of his life had been spent struggling to catch up to Go Geom-wol.

He couldn’t even imagine his life without Go Geom-wol, his current self.

Because Go Geom-wol existed, the current Lee Gwak could exist.

Perhaps because of that, a multitude of indescribable emotions swirled in Lee Gwak’s s eyes as he looked at Go Geom-wol.

Then, Go Geom-wol lowered his gaze and looked at Lee Gwak.

A faint smile played on his lips.

“It has been an honor to live in the same era as you.”

“For me, I am simply grateful to have lived in the same era as you.” [a]

“If only I had… No! I’m spouting unnecessary nonsense. It’s time to see the end.”

Go Geom-wol started to say something but stopped and raised his sword.

Lee Gwak was curious about what he was going to say, but he didn’t ask further and raised his blade.

It was truly time to see the end.

A silence fell between the two as they aimed their weapons at each other.

It felt as if even the flow of air had stopped due to their confrontation.

People watched them, holding their breath.

They instinctively sensed that the outcome would be decided in this final clash.

Although there were tens of thousands of martial artists present, not a single one dared to breathe loudly. They stared wide-eyed at Lee Gwak and Go Geom-wol.

Lee Gwak and Go Geom-wol channeled all their remaining energy into their weapons.

Their blade and sword cried out.

The sword’s cry amplified the blade’s cry, and the blade’s cry further heightened the sword’s cry.

Zziing! Zziiing!

It was as if the entire world was trapped within the cries of the sword and blade.

In this world resonating with blade and sword, only Lee Gwak and Go Geom-wol existed.

‘This is really the end.’

‘The last one.’

They launched themselves towards each other.

Boom!

An explosion like the end of the world shook the earth.

The ground, already cratered like a volcano, suffered an even greater wound, and the atmosphere raged violently as if swept up in a storm.

“Ugh!”

“Ah!”

Most warriors were thrown to the ground, unable to even open their eyes. Only masters like Ja Seol-gyeong and Muk Cheon-gang kept their gaze fixed and unflinching.

The two figures collided in midair, then were hurled apart with equal force.

One barely stabilized before hitting the ground, the other crashed violently into the earth.

Thud!

The fallen figure tumbled helplessly until he struck someone’s legs and came to a stop.

It was Go Geom-wol, his body pierced all over by shattered blade fragments.

Lee Gwak’s blade had shattered upon impact, embedding its fragments into Go Geom-wol’s body.

Meanwhile, Go Geom-wol’s sword was buried in Lee Gwak’s abdomen. Fortunately, the broken blade had narrowly missed a vital point.

Go Geom-wol was not so lucky.

The fragments had pierced several of his vital meridians. Not even a divine physician could save him now.

“Alliance Leader!”

“Supreme One!”

The Celestial Demon Troupe warriors rushed toward him, but the Heavenly Justice Alliance blocked their way.

Their cries rang out, but Go Geom-wol’s gaze was fixed only on the boy standing before him—the one whose legs had stopped his fall.

Their eyes met.

And Go Geom-wol smiled, a smile meant only for him.

The boy squeezed his eyes shut.

His name was Jang Cheon-hwa, the young master of Heavenly Martial Manor.

Thrust!

Jang Cheon-hwa’s sword pierced Go Geom-wol’s heart. Yet even then, Go Geom-wol smiled.

As his vision blurred, the last thing he saw was Jang Cheon-hwa’s tear-streaked face.

“Waaah! The Heavenly Martial Manor’s young master has slain Go Geomwol!”

“The Heavenly Justice Alliance is victorious!”

Roars of triumph filled the battlefield.

A new young hero had been born.

Though Lee Gwak had dealt the decisive blow, it was the boy who had delivered the final strike.

The Heavenly Justice Alliance warriors exalted him with thunderous cheers.

The Celestial Demon Troupe warriors, having lost their supreme leader, scattered in retreat. Yet Go Geom-wol felt no sorrow.

I did not lose… Lee Gwak…

With those final thoughts, Go Geom-wol’s gaze lingered on Lee Gwak before life left his body.

“Waaah!”

“Hero Lee has triumphed!”

The crowd surged around Lee Gwak.

A massive crowd surrounded Yi Guo [b] . They praised him and celebrated the victory.

Engulfed by the crowd, Yi Guo looked in the direction of Go Geom-wol’s body. But with so many people surrounding him, he couldn’t see outside.

“Long live Hero Yi!”

“The Heavenly Righteousness Alliance has won!”

“Let’s drive out the Divine Demon Alliance!”

People shouted cheers, chanting Yi Guo’s name.

A hint of madness could be felt in their appearance as they raised their weapons and cheered.

Their frenzy continued for a while.

It was quite some time later that Yi Guo managed to free himself from the crowd.

The first to approach Yi Guo after he found his freedom were Han So-cheon and the children.

“You’ve worked hard.”

“Dad!”

Han So-cheon used her sleeve to wipe the sweat and blood from Lee Gwak’s face. Lee Gwak, holding his abdomen where Go Geom-wol’s sword was embedded, accepted her touch.

“Sect Leader!”

Soon, the martial artists of the Mad Martial Sect gathered around Lee Gwak and his family.

Each one of them was injured and exhausted. But their expressions were brighter than ever.

Lim So-bo, Seok Yi-cheon, Cheong Un-san, Cheon Wol, Cheol Gwang-woo, Bang Ye-in…….

Those who had believed in him and followed him were there.

Fortunately, they had survived.

They confirmed each other’s survival and rejoiced.

Cheol Gwang-woo shed tears, unbefitting his large frame. Seok Yi-cheon teased him upon seeing this.

“A big bear like you crying? If Jin-hwi saw that, he’d tease you forever.”

“Speaking of which, I don’t see Brother Jin Hwi. He didn’t die, did he?”

“What kind of guy do you think he is? Of course, he survived.”

“Then why can’t I see him?”

“He saw the Mad [c] Martial Sect Leader, said he had something to check, and disappeared. That guy, really.”

Seok Yi-cheon clicked his tongue.

“What does he need to check?”

“How should I know? He looked like he’d seen a ghost.”

“But he’s alive, right? That’s enough. Hahaha!”

“Yes, surviving is all that matters. Ha ha!”

The two laughed aloud.

The joy of survival outweighed even the end of the war.

Surrounded by his companions, Lee Gwak savored their victory.

Then, he suddenly felt a piercing gaze.

Looking up, he saw Muk Cheon-gang and Dam Soo-rin waving to him from afar before disappearing beyond the hills.
