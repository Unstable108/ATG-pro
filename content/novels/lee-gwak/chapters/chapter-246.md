The sound of tearing silk made Spirit Granny’s eyes widen.

Her powerful qi was split in two and dispersed, and Lee Gwak was charging through the gap.

In just two steps, Lee Gwak reached Spirit Granny.

His blade directly aimed at Spirit Granny’s forehead.

Spirit Granny, enraged, swung her Dragon Head Staff wildly.

Lee Gwak’s blade was deflected by her staff, but his blade quickly drew a bizarre trajectory in the air, targeting Spirit Granny once more.

“You dare use such demonic martial arts.”

With a roar, Spirit Granny unleashed the Slaying Dragon Blood Blossom Staff.

The air was filled with afterimages of her Dragon Head Staff.

Each afterimage carried the weight and power of a real strike, and they poured down on Lee Gwak like a rainstorm.

Any normal martial artist, anyone with common sense, would have retreated.

Instead, he charged forward, fiercely swinging his blade against the rain of afterimages.

Sparks flew as Lee Gwak’s blade collided with the Dragon Head Staff, clashing dozens of times in an instant.

Spirit Granny’s brow furrowed deeply.

She felt significant shock through her dragon head staff.

‘Where did this youngster come from?’

Spirit Granny had internally underestimated Lee Gwak.

Martial arts strength was supposed to grow with years of training, and it was rare for someone to leap over the gaps created by time, no matter how talented.

As far as Spirit Granny knew, only a few geniuses could do so.

‘At best, Only the ten lesser skies…’

Spirit Granny was surprisingly out of touch with the Jianghu’s current affairs.

Due to her arrogant nature, she paid little attention to others, and likewise, few dared to approach her with information.

As a result, Spirit Granny knew almost nothing about the new generation of martial artists emerging in the Jianghu. Therefore, she had absolutely no information about Lee Gwak.

His blade, like a viper, targeted Spirit Granny’s vitals without following any predetermined forms.

His bladesmanship lacked any fixed form or sequence.

Cutting, hacking, swinging, pushing, stabbing, pressing.

By repeating or combining these six actions that maximize the potential of the blade, Lee Gwak transcended conventional limitations.

The sound of his blade play echoed endlessly, reminiscent of a hissing snake. With each sound, Spirit Granny felt her life was in danger.

A malicious light flashed in Spirit Granny’s eyes.

Throughout her life, her vicious nature had led her to accumulate countless enemies. Yet she had always remained safe by eliminating every potential threat, leaving no grudges behind.

This was her secret to dominating the Jianghu for so long.

‘If he is this powerful now, what kind of monster will he become if he continues to grow? I must kill him, whatever the cost.

Once she made up her mind, Spirit Granny’s gaze changed.

Her eyes glowed with killing intent, and an aura of a rampaging dragon began to surge from her entire body.

Yeom So-so’s face filled with shock as she witnessed the sight.

“Master is using the Storm Dragon Fire Skill?”

Storm Dragon Fire Skill was a secret internal energy technique that Spirit Granny had cultivated for a long time.

Achieving mastery of Storm Dragon Fire could explosively increase one’s internal energy manyfold in an instant. For someone beyond human limits like Spirit Granny, it granted a momentary burst of power several times stronger than normal.

Spirit Granny had prepared this skill to face one of the Ten Great Overlords of Jianghu, keeping it hidden until now.

To use such a technique now meant she either regarded Lee Gwak on par with the Ten Great Masters or viewed him as a significant threat.

For Yeom So-so, who knew Spirit Granny’s pride, this was an unbelievable development.

Yeom So-so murmured in disbelief, but she quickly regained her composure.

The battle between Lee Gwak and Spirit Granny had far exceeded her ability to intervene. She needed to support her master in another way.

Yeom So-so’s gaze turned towards Bang Ye-in.

If Bang Ye-in had simply accepted her offer, none of this would have happened, and they wouldn’t be suffering now.

Taking Bang Ye-in now seemed pointless. Killing her seemed the only way to settle Yeom So-so’s frustration.

Yeom So-so quietly gathered her internal energy, moving towards Bang Ye-in. However, a towering man stood in her way before she could reach her target.

“What’s your relation to that old hag?”

The rough voice belonged to Cheol Gwang-woo.

Yeom So-so sneered, raising her hand to strike.

She had learned the Shattering Bone Palm technique from her master. A hit from this technique could destroy muscles and bones alike, rendering the victim crippled.

Yeom So-so’s Shattering Bone Palm struck against Cheol Gwang-woo’s chest.

Even for a holder of formidable martial arts, a single blow from the Shattering Bone Palm could render them as helpless as an octopus out of water.

Yeom So-so expected Cheol Gwang-woo to collapse like an octopus, attempting to pass him by.

However, Cheol Gwang-woo’s reaction was not as she anticipated. Far from collapsing, he

grasped Yeom So-so’s shoulder tightly with his large hand.

The pain, as if being clamped by a giant iron vice, furrowed Yeom So-so’s brow. To this, Cheol Gwang-woo said,

“Such a technique wouldn’t even take down a mosquito.”

As Cheol Gwang-woo raised his hand, Yeom So-so saw the giant palm, like a pot lid, coming down. A flicker of fear crossed her eyes.

At that moment, Cheol Gwang-woo’s palm flew towards Yeom So-so’s cheek. She quickly raised her arm to shield her face.

Cheol Gwang-woo’s palm struck Yeom So-so’s arm and sent her body flying a good ten meters. The force could only be described as brutally simple.

Yeom So-so’s forearm, now blackened and swollen as it hit the ground, indicated the severity of the impact. Had the blow landed on her cheek, her brain might have turned to mush.

Contrary to the blackened arm, Yeom So-so’s face turned pale.

“Without my permission, no one lays a hand on her.”

Cheol Gwang-woo started walking towards Yeom So-so.

The chest where Yeom So-so’s palm struck felt slightly sore, but that was all.

His Vajra Demon Shadow Technique had now reached a level of ascension that not only protected his muscles and bones but his internal organs as well.

Though Yeom So-so’s Shattering Bone Palm was a fearsome technique, harming his body protected by the Vajra Demon Shadow Technique was impossible.

Bang Ye-in, forgetting her pain for a moment, exclaimed in awe at the sight of Cheol Gwang-woo standing protectively in front of her. It was an unfamiliar feeling for her.

Being protected by someone was a first for her. The sense of security was strange but comforting.

Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah approached her.

Surprised by the sudden appearance of unfamiliar children, Bang Ye-in quickly remembered they had come with Lee Gwak and others.

“We’re Lee Cheong and Lee Soo-ah. The man fighting that old woman is our dad.”

Bang Ye-in wore a confused expression upon hearing Lee Cheong’s answer. The Lee Gwak she knew was still unmarried. The news of his marriage was surprising, but having such lovely children was even more astonishing.

Unaware or not of Bang Ye-in’s feelings, Lee Soo-ah smiled and said,

“Big sis, don’t worry too much. Our dad will win.”

“That old woman is very scary. She is…”

“Even so, our dad will win. Soo-ah believes in our dad. So, big sis, you don’t have to worry about anything.”

The situation was absurd, and being comforted by children was even more so. Yet, somehow, it was reassuring.

At that moment, a tremendous shockwave erupted, sweeping across the area with Lee Gwak and Spirit Granny at its center.

Their fierce battle had reached its climax.

Lee Gwak’s body was stained with blood in several places.

Some of the wounds had been inflicted by Spirit Granny, while others were from the injuries he sustained breaking through the Heaven and Earth Net to get here.

Spirit Granny was one of the top 8 strongest martial artists in the world . To fight her, Lee Gwak had to give his all.

Pushing his body to its limits had taken its toll, reopening healing wounds. Despite the excruciating pain, Lee Gwak gritted his teeth and endured.

Spirit Granny’s Storm Dragon Fire was terrifying.

It had amplified her formidable power several times over.

Each of her movements contained enough force to upheave the earth and shatter the skies.

Each swing of her Dragon Head Staff created a tremendous air pressure, constraining Lee Gwak’s movements as if he were entangled. This slowed him down significantly, as if he were isolated deep underwater, struggling for breath.

The Eight Snakes Art Activated.

A large serpent seemed to uncoil, winding around Lee Gwak’s body and propelling his blade forward.

Nothing seemed to change on the surface. However, Spirit Granny, facing him directly, instinctively sensed something was different.

A chilling sensation transmitted through the Dragon Head Staff upon colliding with Lee Gwak’s blade.

It was as if the staff itself screamed.

Scratches appeared on the surface of the Dragon Head Staff, made from millennia-old cold steel, a material said to be indestructible. Lee Gwak’s blade was carving into it, creating deep grooves.

Unable to withstand it any longer, Spirit Granny attempted to retreat, but Lee Gwak followed her like a shadow.

When Spirit Granny swung her staff fiercely, Lee Gwak smoothly diverted it. When she withdrew her staff , he closed in further.

Not just from the Eight Snakes Art, but his blade conveyed sensations as well.

It was as if the blade’s essence was being felt directly through his fingertips.

The flow of air, the opponent’s breathing, even the movement of internal energy was vividly transmitted.

Lee Gwak was the blade, and the blade was Lee Gwak.

Every movement of his was an expression of bladesmanship.

Spirit Granny’s eyes violently shook.

Every bit of energy she released was being sliced away by Lee Gwak’s blade. No technique she used could stop him.

Even the strong qi embedded in her Dragon Head Staff couldn’t halt Lee Gwak’s advance. He was like a salmon swimming upstream, cutting through all of Spirit Granny’s attacks to get closer.

Her heart chilled. And she felt fear.

At that moment, Spirit Granny’s Dragon Head Staff was split in two by Lee Gwak’s blade.

The severed part clattered to the ground, sounding like a scream to Spirit Granny.

Spirit Granny’s eyes widened in shock.

The Dragon Head Staff, which she had used for decades, was as much a part of her as her own limbs. The sensation was as if an arm had been severed, and she screamed in anguish.

“No, this can’t be happening!”

At that moment, Lee Gwak’s blade pierced Spirit Granny’s heart.

Her heart, which had been pulsating vigorously, stopped as the foreign object impaled it, causing her to open her mouth wide in shock.

Spirit Granny flailed her hands and finally grabbed Lee Gwak’s collar.

Lee Gwak met the wide-eyed gaze of Spirit Granny.

“How dare… How could someone like you…”

In a voice only Spirit Granny could hear, Lee Gwak spoke softly.

Spirit Granny tightened her grip on Lee Gwak’s collar, mustering her last bit of strength in an attempt to strangle him.

At that moment, Lee Gwak drove his blade even deeper into her heart.

Spirit Granny coughed up dark red blood.

Her blood drenched her face, but Lee Gwak did not flinch. He simply looked at her quietly.

The vitality completely faded from Spirit Granny’s once fearsome face.
