After resting well at the inn for a day, their bodies felt quite refreshed.

Not only Lee Gwak, but also Lee Cheong and Nam Woo-gyeong wore content expressions.

They went down to the first floor of the inn and had their meal.

“sweet and sour pork for breakfast. Nice!”

Nam Woo-gyeong smiled with satisfaction as he looked at the dish brought by the innkeeper.

A strong smell of liquor drifted from his mouth.

He had spent the entire night drinking with members of the Hao Clan.

Even in this small village, the Hao Clan had a branch, and its members would not let Nam Woo-gyeong leave without sharing a drink. He had stayed up all night talking and drinking with them, and only managed to return to the inn at the break of dawn.

Though he had hardly slept, his body felt surprisingly good thanks to the comfortable bed. His smile did not fade.

The sweet and sour pork they had for breakfast was splendid. Eaten with hot rice, it cleared away the last remnants of his hangover.

Lee Gwak tasted the dish and could not hide his admiration. He had also drunk a bottle of liquor by himself the previous day. Although that wasn’t nearly enough to make him hungover, a few spoonfuls of the sweet and sour pork left him feeling refreshed.

The three of them quickly finished their meal of rice and sweet and sour pork.

When they had finished eating, Nam Woo-gyeong set down his chopsticks and spoke.

“Ah! This is great. I wish every day could be like this.”

“Indeed.”

Lee Gwak nodded.

It had not been long since he had entered the Jianghu, but he was already longing for the peaceful life he had once led on Mount Qilian.

Life in the Jianghu never gave him a moment’s rest – something was always happening, big or small. And the problem was that Lee Gwak never seemed to be able to avoid being caught in the middle of it all.

“Hah…”

Without realizing it, Lee Gwak heaved a sigh.

Nam Woo-gyeong studied him for a moment and then asked quietly,

“Feeling tired?”

“Not exactly, but I am a little worn out.”

“It is no wonder. In just a few months, you’ve gone through such huge events that an ordinary martial artist might not experience even once in a lifetime”.

“ … ”

“You’ve grown into a great tree, that’s why. You’ve become too big to avoid the wind. A breeze would rather pass around you, but since you’re so large, it has no choice but to sweep and shake you. Maybe it was your destiny ever since you earned the nickname ‘Sura blade.’ Whatever the reason, do not let yourself become exhausted.”

“Don’t get tired? Isn’t it ‘cheer up’?”

“Yes. After living in this world, I’ve found that the most important thing is not to tire out. If you keep hanging on, and hang on some more, at some point that crisis will pass. Well, I’m still holding on for dear life myself, but this crisis too will pass one day.”

It was advice drawn from Nam Woo-gyeong’s own life experience.

Sensing the wisdom in his words, Lee Gwak nodded in silence.

Seeing this, Nam Woo-gyeong looked at Lee Gwak with satisfaction in his eyes.

How unpredictable life is! ! Who would have thought that the punk form of those days would grow into a great tree of the Jianghu.

Nam Woo-gyeong considered himself fortunate to have been able to watch Lee Gwak grow up.

As a martial artist of the Hao Clan, it was a truly honorable experience .

Standing up, Nam Woo-gyeong spoke,

“We’ve finished eating, so let’s get going again.”

“Yes!”

Lee Gwak and his son rose to their feet.

Together, they left the inn and headed towards the stables.

When the horses saw their masters, they neighed happily. The three calmed the animals and mounted them.

“Let’s go!”

The horses, well-fed and rested, were brimming with energy.

The three let the horses run freely, knowing that they would slow down when tired.

The scenery swiftly passed by them.

Watching the picturesque landscape, their moods naturally lifted.

A smile appeared on Lee Gwak’s face.

It had been a long time since he had ridden so comfortably in the Jianghu.

The journey felt even better in good company.

Following Nam Woo-gyeong, Lee Gwak continued south for three more days.

Eventually, they reached Ezhou , a city located on the main flow of the Yangtze River. And the nearby Dong Lake had always been a central hub for trade and goods due to its strategic location.

As a crossroads of water and land routes, Ezhou was bustling. The streets were crowded with people whose faces were full of life.

This was a rare sight in the Jianghu, especially since the turmoil caused by the Jade Heaven alliance had begun. While war brought devastation and suffering, it also brought prosperity to some. Ezhou was one such place.

But even the prosperous Ezhou had its dark corners, and it was to one of these that Nam Woo-gyeong led Lee Gwak and his son.

As they appeared, the locals in the slums showed signs of caution. But when one of them recognized Nam Woo-gyeong, everyone lowered their guards.

An elderly man with a bushy beard approached. At first glance, he seemed ordinary, but he was the overseer of the Hao Clan members in Ezhou.

“How did you come to be here, Young Master?”

“It’s been a while, Great Master!”

“I heard you suffered greatly at the hands of the Nine Dragons Clan. We were quite worried, but it’s relieving to see you safe,” The old man whom Nam Woo-gyeong called “Great Master,” flushed slightly. His name was Hong Cheon-rak.

Long before Nam Woo-gyeong was even born, Hong Cheon-rak had managed the Hao Clan members here in Ezhou and mentored countless disciples

His disciples grew up to become the backbone of the Hao Clan, and Nam Woo-gyeong was one of them. Out of respect, they called him Great Master.

Though Nam Woo-gyeong had a formal teacher known as Hội An, he, like the others, addressed Hong Cheon-rak as his Great Master.

Nam Woo-gyeong had great respect for Hong Cheon-rak. But this was not the moment for friendly conversation.

“Where is the Clan Leader?”

Hong Cheon-rak pointed towards a small fishing boat on Dong Lake.

Dong Lake was dotted with many fishing boats, but the one he indicated was as shabby as any around it. Real fishermen appeared to be working on its deck, yet to Nam Woo-gyeong, this was not at all odd.

“Please take me to the Clan Leader.”

“Who is this?”

Instead of answering, Hong Cheon-rak looked suspiciously at Lee Gwak and his son.

“Let me introduce them. There’s no need for suspicion. This is Lee Gwak, the man who saved me.”

“Ah! The Sura Blade?”

Hong Cheon-rak was visibly surprised and looked at Lee Gwak, who greeted him with a fist salute.

“I am junior Lee Gwak.”

“My old eyes could not recognize the hero who has shaken the Jianghu so profoundly. Please forgive my rudeness.”

“Not at all.”

“Haha! It’s an honor to meet the Sura Blade here in person!”

Hong Cheon-rak gazed at Lee Gwak with genuine admiration. Though the intensity of his stare made Lee Gwak slightly uncomfortable, he merely accepted it calmly.

Having confirmed Lee Gwak’s identity, Hong Cheon-rak hastened to prepare a small boat for them. The three of them boarded, and a fisherman rowed towards the fishing boat.

The fishermen working on the fishing boat, initially wary, relaxed when they recognized Nam Woo-gyeong.

“Young Master Nam?”

“You are safe.”

They quickly helped Nam Woo-gyeong aboard.

These fishermen were no ordinary men, but rather the personal guard responsible for protecting the Hao Clan’s Clan Leader.

“Where is the Clan Leader?”

“He’s inside. We’ll announce your arrival.”

At that moment, a deep, resonant voice sounded from within the cabin.

“Woo-gyeong, come on in.”

It was the voice of the Hao Clan’s Clan Leader.

Nam Woo-gyeong nodded at Lee Gwak and his son.

“Let’s go inside.”

“Should we ask for permission first…?”

“The clan leader already knows you’ve come. No need for further permission.”

“Understood.”

“Let’s go!”

Nam Woo-gyeong confidently opened the cabin door and went inside.

Lee Gwak and his son Lee Cheong quietly followed.

The cabin was very cramped.

An old man in his early sixties was sitting in a small space that could fit three or four people at most.

His ordinary appearance and sparse hair made him look like anyone one might see on the street. However, his gaze was anything but ordinary.

Even in the dimly lit cabin, his eyes glowed like torches.

Nam Woo-gyeong bowed to him respectfully.

“Disciple Nam Woo-gyeong greets the Clan Leader.”

“It’s been a while, Woo-gyeong!”

For an instant, the old man’s fierce gaze softened into one of kindness.

This was Shim Wol, the Clan Leader of the Hao Clan.

Tens of thousands of Hao Clan’s disciples would lay down their lives at his word. His importance to the Hao Clan was absolute.

“As you can see, I’m fine.”

“Thank goodness.”

“And it’s all thanks to Gwak here. Because of him, I managed to escape the Nine Dragons Clan unscathed.”

“That is truly something to be grateful for.”

Shim Wol’s gaze shifted to Lee Gwak.

For a moment, the eyes of the two men met in midair.

Lee Gwak felt a strange aura emanating from Shim Wol’s eyes.

Shim Wol cupped his fist in salute to Lee Gwak.

“Thank you so much for rescuing our Young Master, O Great Hero!”

“Please, there’s no need for thanks. I simply did what had to be done.”

“There is no need for humility. Nam Woo-gyeong is the only heir who can take my place one day. If he had lost his life at the Nine Dragons Clan or been controlled by the worm poison, our clan would have suffered greatly.”

Shim Wol was well informed about the events that had transpired at the distant Nine Dragons Clan.

Lee Gwak was once again amazed by the incredible intelligence network of the Hao Clan, and he was equally surprised to see that the master of the Hao Clan looked like such an ordinary old man. Of course, the moment he saw Shim Wol, he knew the man was anything but ordinary.

Shim Wol’s gaze then turned to Lee Cheong.

“So, you must be this great hero’s son. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”

“Ah, hello. I am Lee Cheong.”

“I know.”

“You know me?”

Lee Cheong widened his eyes in surprise, and Shim Wol smiled kindly.

“Weren’t you a finalist at the martial arts competition at the Nine Dragons Clan? How could I not know of someone with such talent?”

“Ah!”

Embarrassed, Lee Cheong’s face reddened.

Shim Wol watched him smile warmly, then turned his attention back to Lee Gwak.

“We have distinguished guests, and yet we’re on a boat with little to offer.”

“That’s alright.”

“Is it though? Who’s outside?”

Shim Wol called someone from outside the boat.

“Yes! Clan Leader. I am here.”

The response came immediately.

“We have an honored guest, so bring in one of today’s catch.”

“We’re already steaming one fish as a snack to go with the drinks. Please give us a moment, and I’ll bring it right in!”

“Haha! Thank you. You’re indispensable.”

Shim Wol smiled amicably.

He then looked at Nam Woo-gyeong.

“This is the first time you’ve brought someone to me. You must want something, right?”

“That’s correct.”

Nam Woo-gyeong nodded readily.

Though everyone in the Jianghu knew of the Hao Clan, no one knew that the Clan Leader’s name was Shim Wol. The very existence of Shim Wol was a top secret.

The Hao Clan had the most extensive intelligence network in the Jianghu, but they severely lacked the means to protect themselves.

About a hundred years ago, the first female Clan Leader of the Hao Clan, Gi Ye-hwa, created a formidable military force called Death Command Squad, but even they couldn’t protect the whole Hao Clan.

Thus, the Hao Clan had always hidden the identity of their leaders. Without sufficient power to defend themselves, they had no choice.

Even Nam Woo-gyeong had kept his identity hidden, but eventually, he was exposed and suffered at the hands of the Nine Dragons Clan. It was customary for the Clan Leader of the Hao Clan not to reveal his identity to outsiders.

But today, Nam Woo-gyeong broke that tradition by bringing outsiders to meet Shim Wol.

It was the first time in the history of the Hao Clan that such a thing had happened.

Even for someone like Nam Woo-gyeong, without a valid reason, this was a serious matter that could not go unpunished.

Shim Wol’s eyes demanded an explanation, and Nam Woo-gyeong responded.

“I want to repay Lee Gwak.”

“Repay?”

“It’s more of a proposal that would benefit both Lee Gwak and us.”

“A mutually beneficial proposal? Is there such a thing?”

Shim Wol’s eyes sharpened.

He had spent his life protecting the Hao Clan. If there was anything he could do to protect the Hao Clan from the wolves that sought to dominate the world, he would do it. However, he was ready to punish any foolish talk from Nam Woo-gyeong.

After taking a deep breath, Nam Woo-gyeong finally spoke.

“I would like to invite Lee Gwak as a guest of honor to our Clan.”

“A guest of honor?”

“Yes!”

“Do you understand how risky that idea is?”

“I do. But I trust Lee Gwak that much.”

They enjoyed the benefits of the clan but had almost no responsibilities.

It was the clan’s job to clean up their messes,and any wrong actions by the guest could potentially tarnish the clan’s honor.

For this reason, many clans were cautious about welcoming guests of honor from outside.

Especially since the Hao Clan had never in its hundreds of years of history welcomed a guest of honor.

The lifeblood of the Hao Clan was its secretive intelligence network, and welcoming a guest of honor would mean exposing their accumulated intelligence. On the other hand, the Hao Clan could only request, not compel, Lee Gwak.

Shim Wol glared at Nam Woo-gyeong.

“Are you serious?”

“Absolutely. I truly trust that Lee Gwak will not misuse our intelligence for personal gain.”

While the offer was said to benefit both, Nam Woo-gyeong’s suggestion was essentially to give wings to Lee Gwak.
