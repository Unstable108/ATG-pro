Eun Gwang Ho extended a long object wrapped in white cloth to Lee Gwak.

“Take it. It’s yours.”

Having stayed up all night, his face showed signs of fatigue. However, his eyes sparkled with anticipation.

He was curious about Lee Gwak’s reaction to the masterpiece he had created.

“May I unwrap it now?”

“Of course. It’s yours, so do as you wish.”

“Yes!”

Lee Gwak removed the white cloth that enveloped the blade and its sheath. A modestly designed sheath and blade were revealed.

The sheath, made of high-quality steel, was covered with well-treated cowhide that gave it a glossy finish. The exposed hilt, also wrapped tightly with cowhide, prevented slipping from the hand.

At the end of the grip was a small ring, to which a simple tassel was attached.

Lee Gwak gripped the hilt.

It fit perfectly into his palm, as though it had been molded for him.

The hilt felt like an extension of his hand, as if he had wielded it for years.

After savoring the hilt’s texture, Lee Gwak cautiously drew the blade.

Srrring!

The plain-looking blade revealed itself.

It was a straight blade, without any curve, resembling a straight branch.

Lee Gwak had been most satisfied with the straight blade that Eun Gwang Ho had made in the past. So, Eun Gwang Ho had crafted him another straight blade this time.

The blade, shorter than usual, was easy to handle with one hand. Such types of straight blades were sometimes referred to as ring-pommel blades.

On the side of the blade, the words “Star Soul” were delicately engraved.

“Star Soul!”

Suddenly, Lee Gwak felt a slight tremor in his hand.

It was as if Star Soul was responding to his call.

With his eyes closed, Lee Gwak felt the vibration of Star Soul, savoring the feeling of unity with the blade for a long time.

Then, opening his eyes, Lee Gwak spoke.

“Excellent.”

“Do you like it?”

“It’s the best.”

“I knew it would be.”

Eun Gwang Ho grinned, pleased.

These words, coming from Lee Gwak himself, meant a lot.

Hearing such words from Lee Gwak, who could be considered the top swordsman in the Jianghu, made him feel great.

Feeling accustomed to Star Soul in his hand, Lee Gwak felt an itch to move.

“May I swing the blade for a bit?”

“Let’s go to the backyard.”

Eun Gwang Ho readily nodded and led Lee Gwak to the backyard. The backyard was large enough that he could swing the sword to his heart’s content.

Lee Gwak began to lightly swing the blade.

Whoom! Whoom!

The sound of the blade cutting through the air echoed in the yard.

At first slowly, but as time passed, the swings became faster.

“Ah!”

Eun Gwang Ho’s eyes widened.

There was nothing special about Lee Gwak’s movements. He was merely thrusting, cutting, and slicing. But, Eun Gwang Ho felt an inexplicable sense of oppression and a chilling sensation.

Lee Gwak’s blade was cutting through the empty air as if he was facing an opponent.

An invisible, absent someone.

Ssst! Ssst!

The slashing sounds grew sharper.

“Kuh!”

Eun Gwang Ho’s face tightened.

Even though Lee Gwak was not aiming the blade at him, he felt as though his whole body might be sliced apart.

Is this his true skill?

The Myriad Merchant Troupe had amassed the greatest wealth under heaven. To protect such vast wealth, they required a large number of powerful martial artists.

They had used their vast resources to employ or nurture numerous martial artists. Eun Gwang

Ho had met many, but none gave him the eerie feeling that Lee Gwak did.

Lost in thought, Eun Gwang Ho watched Lee Gwak’s swordplay.

Lee Gwak did not use any special techniques or flashy moves, yet to Eun Gwang Ho, it appeared more impressive than any martial arts.

Sssit! Sssit!

Lee Gwak’s movements became faster.

Silver lines began to wrap around his body, eventually making him invisible.

It was a Blade Membrane.

He had created a blade membrane with his blade speed alone, without even using his Eight Sects Blade Art

Eun Gwang Ho watched, spellbound.

Whoosh!

The wind moved with Lee Gwak. Or rather, Lee Gwak controlled the wind.

After a while of mindlessly swinging the blade, Lee Gwak gradually stopped.

“Whew!”

A satisfied smile formed on his lips as he exhaled lightly.

The blade Eun Gwang Ho had made for him was genuine.

The feeling of becoming one with the blade was something he had never experienced before.

Lee Gwak looked at the blade in his hand for a while in silence.

Eun Gwang Ho approached him and lightly patted his shoulder.

“The blade has found its true master.”

“Thank you for making such a fine sword.”

“What’s there to thank? Being able to make such a blade for a bladesman like you is my fortune. If you still feel a bit of gratitude towards me… Ah, never mind.”

“Please, feel free to speak.”

Lee Gwak’s words caused Eun Gwang Ho to bite his lip, a conflicted expression appeared on his face.

After a moment, Eun Gwang Ho spoke hesitantly.

“If you ever come into conflict with the Myriad Merchant Troupe, remember me and show some

mercy.”

Even though he had left the Myriad Merchant Troupe of his own accord, it still occupied a large part of his heart. That’s why he made this embarrassing request.

Lee Gwak readily nodded.

“I will do so.”

“Thank you. Really, I shouldn’t even be asking you for such a favor, but the heart isn’t always ruled by logic.”

“Not at all.”

“Sigh!”

Eun Gwang Ho let out a deep sigh, but soon smiled and asked Lee Gwak.

“What do you plan to do now? Are you thinking of staying in Gaiyang?”

“No. My wife’s health has improved significantly, so we plan to leave.”

“Do you have a place in mind?”

“Not yet. I’m going to discuss it with my family now.”

“Sigh! It won’t be easy for you. Alright then. You should go; your family must be waiting.”

“I’ll stop by again when I leave.”

“There’s no need. I’ll be staying here, so feel free to visit whenever you’re nearby.”

“Then I’ll take my leave. I hope to meet you again in good health.”

Lee Gwak bowed to Eun Gwang Ho.

Eun Gwang Ho waved his hand.

“Go on.”

“Yes!”

Lee Gwak stepped outside.

It had been morning when he received the blade, but now the sun was high in the sky. This was evidence of how deeply he had been immersed in his practice.

Lee Gwak strapped the Star Soul to his waist and moved on.

“Daddy!”

As he returned to the inn, Lee Soo-ah rushed into his arms.

Lee Soo-ah rubbed her face against Lee Gwak.

“Did you wait for me?”

“I waited to have lunch with you.”

“Really?”

“Yes! Let’s go inside.”

Urged by Lee Soo-ah, Lee Gwak hurried inside.

Inside the outbuilding, Han So Cheon had already set the table.

“Welcome back.”

“Daddy, you’re back.”

Han So Cheon and Lee Cheong warmly greeted Lee Gwak.

All three of them looked at the Star Soul hanging at Lee Gwak’s waist. Their eyes were filled with anticipation as they looked at the blade.

“Is that the blade elder made for you?” Han So Cheon asked.

“Want to see it?”

“Can I?”

She asked cautiously.

In the Jianghu, it was taboo to handle someone else’s weapon without permission, even between husband and wife. However, Lee Gwak handed her the blade without hesitation.

Han So Cheon carefully drew it.

Srrrng!

“Wow!”

Han So Cheon involuntarily gasped as the blade fully revealed itself.

She, too, was a martial artist who had spent years roaming the Jianghu.

Though her martial arts and the weapons she used differed from those of Lee Gwak, her eye for weapons was razor-sharp.

From her perspective, there was not a single flaw in Lee Gwak’s blade. In all her years traveling the Jianghu, it was the first time she’d seen a masterpiece like this.

Just looking at it made her heart flutter.

“I want to see it too.”

“Me too!”

Lee Soo-ah and Lee Cheong approached to admire the blade as well.

Their reactions were no different from Han So Cheon’s—both children stared at it, spellbound.

“Hoo…”

Tap!

Letting out a soft sigh, Han So Cheon carefully slid the blade back into its sheath.

Seeing her sigh, Lee Gwak gave her a puzzled look. Han So Cheon handed the blade back and spoke.

“It just feels like… destiny.”

“Destiny?”

“I don’t think it’s a mere chance that such a fine blade ended up in your hands.”

All things exist for a reason.

A martial artist exists to fight. Likewise, a blade exists to cut.

It doesn’t matter whether a blade is good or bad, whether it’s sharp or dull.

A blade, by its very nature, is forged to slice another person.

Even a cheap blade is wielded to cut someone. All the more so for Lee Gwak’s blade, a rare masterpiece-surely it didn’t come to him by coincidence.

A greater battle must be waiting, which is why such a blade has come to him.

Lee Gwak was not an ambitious person. He never craved more fame than he already had. As long as he and those around him were safe, he wanted nothing else. That’s why he willingly chose to retire with Han So Cheon.

An ambitious man would never have done this. However, fate drew Lee Gwak back into Jianghu, preparing him for a bigger battle. This was why it was all the more regrettable.

The treacherous path that lay ahead for him was clearly visible in Han So Cheon’s eyes.

Suddenly, Han So Cheon bit her lip.

It made no sense for her to live in comfort while Lee Gwak walked a dangerous path alone. She had to help him in some way.

“This can’t be right.”

The problem was her physical condition.

During her fight with Je Mu hyeok, she realized just how terrible her condition was.

Three years away from the Jianghu had erased the “Assassin King” Han So Cheon. Now she was merely a passably skilled martial artist, or perhaps a slightly above-average assassin.

To return to her former self as the Assassin King, she would need a drastic measure. And Han So Cheon knew what that measure was.

“Oraboni.”

She spoke with difficulty.

Sensing that her words were not ordinary, Lee Gwak’s face stiffened.

“What is it?”

“I’m going to Mount Sohua.”

“Mount Sohua?”

His eyes flickered.

He recalled what was there.

“Are you thinking of entering the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall?”

Han So Cheon answered without hesitation.

The Steel Hell Blood Training Hall was established by the first leader of the Jade Heaven Alliance, Cho Yeon-woo, to oppose the Demonic Cult.

Many young talents from the Jianghu entered the facility, and those who passed all its trials emerged as top experts of the Jianghu.

They made significant contributions in the Great Heavenly Blood War and helped bring peace to the Jianghu. Some of those who survived the war grew into absolute masters.

The facility pushed humans to their limits, allowing them to surpass themselves. For training exceptional talents, there was nothing better.

About ten years ago, the Jade Heaven Alliance reopened the long-closed Iron Blood Hell Training Facility and introduced numerous talents.

Han So-cheon had trained there during that time and blossomed as an assassin. That’s why she wanted to return, to regain her status as the Assassin King.

Lee Gwak asked,

“Is that really necessary? After all the effort to erase your traces as an assassin?”

“I don’t want to return to being an assassin. If I could, I’d live as an ordinary woman. But that’s not possible, is it? The person I love isn’t ordinary. And this kind of thing will keep happening. People will target me and the children to get to you. We can’t always rely on your help.”

“But the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall has already been closed.”

“You know how to reopen it.”

“…”

“I’ll go in with the kids.”

Han So Cheon looked at Lee Cheong and Soo-ah.

In their brief time in the Jianghu, the two had gained a wealth of experiences. Lee Soo-ah had faced Je Mu-hyeok in battle, and Lee Cheong had traveled with Lee Gwak, receiving profound lessons and encountering many situations.

Both were in a state sharp enough for explosive growth.

Han So Cheon looked Lee Gwak straight in the eye.

“Tell me how to enter the Steel Hell Blood Training Hall.”
