“Ugh!”

Yuk Dal-hon fell to his knees, coughing up blood.

Crimson blood stained his chin and chest.

His internal organs churned, and his head was ringing.

It felt as if all his organs were crushed, making it hard to breathe.

“Huff! Huff!”

Yuk Dal-hon gasped for breath, hands on the ground. But the pain did not subside easily.

Bloody saliva dripped from his mouth.

He would have understood if they had exchanged several blows. But it was a single strike.

Not only was he defeated in a single move, but he also suffered severe internal injuries.

Yuk Dal-hon couldn’t comprehend the situation he was in.

After finally catching his breath, Yuk Dal-hon lifted his head to look at Lee Gwak.

“Wh… who are you? Who dares to interfere with us?”

“……”

“Are you another one of those proud heirs of the prestigious sects? Huh! Is that it?”

Yuk Dal-hon shouted in anger.

He struggled to stand up, using his spear as support.

“You people are always like that. Even though you have everything, you never allow others to have even a little. Will you only be satisfied when you’ve taken everything?”

His eyes were bloodshot.

His ghastly appearance terrified the escorts of the Sanghyeon Escort Agency. But there was not a hint of disturbance on Lee Gwak’s face.

That only fueled Yuk Dal-hon’s rage further.

“We’re not asking you to give up everything. We’re just asking to share a little. Was that too much to ask?”

Green Heaven Society was formed by the remnants of sects that were swept away in the war between the Jade Heaven Alliance and the Seven Factions.

Having lost everything in that war, they considered themselves victims. So they believed they had the right to plunder as they pleased.

That’s why they called themselves Green Heaven Society.

Since Cheon Go-seong was not fulfilling its role, they claimed to be the new sky of the Green Forest.

Lee Gwak frowned.

He didn’t know what kind of group Green Heaven Society was. Until today, he had never heard such a name. But just from a few of Yuk Dal-hon’s words, he could easily guess what kind of group Green Heaven Society was.

“I understand your circumstances, but that doesn’t give you the right to take their wealth and lives.”

“Hah! You’re just like them. Always siding with those who have.”

Yuk Dal-hon pointed his spear at Lee Gwak.

He knew he was no match for him. But the burning rage from deep within moved him.

“Yaaah!”

Whoosh!

Yuk Dal-hon swung his spear and charged at Lee Gwak.

A blue aura had formed on his spear.

It was spear energy.

But unfortunately, his spear energy did not reach Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak lowered his waist like a swallow flying over water and rushed toward Yuk Dal-hon.

Clang!

He deflected the incoming spear energy with hisWaterleaf Blade.

Despair flashed across Yuk Dal-hon’s face.

Boom!

At that moment, the sound of a leather drum bursting echoed on the deck. Lee Gwak’s fist had struck Yuk Dal-hon’s abdomen.

Yuk Dal-hon flew off like a kite with a broken string and plunged into the river.

“Leader!”

“Boss!”

The bandits who had barely regained consciousness pulled Yuk Dal-hon out.

Yuk Dal-hon was barely breathing.

If he didn’t receive treatment immediately, his life couldn’t be guaranteed.

The bandits hurriedly left on their swift boat.

Lee Gwak stood on the deck, watching the entire scene. Ban Woo-yeom approached Lee Gwak.

“Master Lee!”

“Are you okay?”

“Thank you for saving my life. I had eyes but failed to see. To have such a master by my side and not recognize him—I am truly ashamed.”

“It’s nothing.”

“Whew! Thanks to you, we survived.”

Ban Woo-yeom let out a sigh of relief.

His eyes, looking at Lee Gwak, were filled with awe.

Even though twenty escorts and guards of the Sanghyeon Escort Agency had fought with all their might, they couldn’t handle Green Heaven Society. Yet Lee Gwak had easily subdued the elite of Green Heaven Society without even breaking a sweat. He didn’t even wield his own weapon.

For Ban Woo-yeom, it was an unimaginable and tremendous martial prowess.

“Lee Gwak… Lee Gwak…”

Ban Woo-yeom repeated Lee Gwak’s name several times in his mind. Then suddenly, a nickname came to his mind.

“Su… sura. Sura Lee Gwak? Could you be…?”

“Yes, that’s correct.”

“My goodness!”

Ban Woo-yeom’s face was filled with shock.

Although the name Sura Blade had been forgotten by many during the three years of turmoil, it had once turned the Jianghu upside down.

Especially when he broke through the White Light Sect’s Heaven and Earth Net just before he disappeared, the martial prowess he displayed was astounding.

Ban Woo-yeom remembered being shocked upon hearing that news. He now blamed himself for only now recognizing Lee Gwak.

“To not recognize a towering figure right in front of me—my eyes are no better than wooden holes.”

Ban Woo-yeom shook his head.

At that moment, Ban Seol-hwa approached them.

“Grandfather, are you okay?”

“I’m fine. Are you hurt anywhere?”

“I’m okay too.”

“Thank goodness. Truly, thank goodness.”

Ban Woo-yeom sighed in relief, confirming that Ban Seol-hwa had no injuries.

If anything had happened to Ban Seol-hwa, it would have remained an eternal regret.

Ban Seol-hwa bowed her head to Lee Gwak.

“Thank you so much for saving my grandfather.”

“It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.”

“Where is Cheong?”

“He’s inside the cabin.”

“He’s unharmed, right?”

“Of course!”

She seemed anxious because she couldn’t see Lee Cheong.

Relief spread across Ban Seol-hwa’s face.

Lee Gwak smiled down at Ban Seol-hwa.

No one had died, but five were seriously injured. The remaining escorts and guards were also not lightly wounded, but there was no problem with their mobility.

Ban Woo-yeom personally led the injured escorts to clean up the ship, which had become a mess.

The fortunate thing was that they hadn’t lost the cargo. If they had lost the cargo, the Sanghyeon Escort Agency would not have been able to avoid bankruptcy.

After handling all matters, Ban Woo-yeom visited Lee Gwak’s cabin with Ban Seol-hwa.

Ban Woo-yeom thanked him once again.

“Thank you. Thanks to you, there were no fatalities.”

“That’s fortunate.”

“I wish to repay you…”

“Letting us ride the ship is enough.”

“Hmm!”

Ban Woo-yeom looked worried at Lee Gwak’s answer. Then Lee Gwak smiled and continued.

“If you feel burdened, please give me a bottle of good wine. That will be enough.”

“Really?”

“Yes!”

“You’re truly unselfish. Even if you were greedier, no one would blame you.”

“It’s not that I have no greed, but rather that I have no need.”

He still had the wealth he received from Ahn Yu-san, the head of the Azure Maritime Company. It was such an enormous amount that he didn’t particularly desire money.

“Understood. If that’s the case… By the way, you said you’re going to Chaohu?”

“Yes.”

“Then I’ll write you a letter. If you need help, seek out Hidden Martial Hall. It’s a fairly old martial hall in Chaohu, so it should be helpful.”

“A letter?”

“The person running Hidden Martial Hall, Oh Geuk-jin, is a friend I studied martial arts with. He has considerable influence in Chaohu, so he should be able to help.”

“Thank you.”

“I’m only sorry that this is all I can do for you.”

“Not at all. That’s more than enough.”

Lee Gwak smiled.

“Phew! Sura Blade… I’ve really formed a connection with an incredible figure. I hope this relationship lasts a long time.”

“It will.”

Lee Gwak glanced over at Lee Cheong and Ban Seol-hwa, who were chatting quietly in one corner of the cabin. Lee Cheong had woken up and came out.

Lee Cheong’s complexion was much better than before he had received the Pushing the Palaces and Passing the Acupoints technique. His internal energy had greatly increased, and the pathways through which his qi flowed had widened considerably.

This laid the foundation for him to potentially reach the realm of constant victory in the future.

Fortunately, no further incidents occurred after the clash with the Green Heaven Society.

Thanks to that, the ship from the Sanghyeon Escort Agency arrived in Jeongju on schedule.

Lee Gwak bid farewell to Ban Woo-yeom.

“Thank you for giving us a ride. It’s time for us to part ways.”

“I should be the one thanking you. I wish you good fortune in your future endeavors.”

“Thank you.”

“Be careful; the Green Heaven Society might hold a grudge and come after you.”

“I will.”

Ban Woo-yeom couldn’t hide his worried expression.

He knew that Green Heaven Society was not a group to forget grudges. Having united with ambitions of ruling the Jianghu, they would surely seek revenge.

Ban Woo-yeom was deeply concerned about that. However, unlike his worries, Lee Gwak didn’t pay much attention.

Right now, the Green Heaven Society was not important to him. What mattered was that, thanks to the Sanghyeon Escort Agency, he could significantly shorten the time it would take to get to Lake Chaohu.

Lee Gwak turned his head to look at Lee Cheong.

Lee Cheong was holding the horses’ reins and saying goodbye to Ban Seol-hwa.

“Well, I’ll be going now.”

“Make sure to visit me later.”

“Okay! I’ll tell my dad and definitely drop by.”

“You promise?”

“Yes! I promise.”

Lee Cheong replied with a determined expression. Only then did a smile return to Ban Seol-hwa’s tense face.

“Then, I’ll be off.”

“Take care! Stay safe.”

“I will.”

With a smile, Lee Cheong turned around. He led the horses and approached Lee Gwak.

“I’m ready, Dad.”

“Alright! Let’s go.”

Lee Gwak nodded and mounted his horse. Lee Cheong also gracefully got on his horse.

The two of them rode off, leaving the harbor behind.

“Ah!”

As Lee Cheong’s figure grew distant, Ban Seol-hwa involuntarily let out a sigh.

“Seol-hwa!”

Ban Woo-yeom placed his hand on Ban Seol-hwa’s shoulder.

“Grandfather!”

“Do you like that boy?”

“……”

Ban Seol-hwa blushed and couldn’t say anything. Seeing her like that, Ban Woo-yeom smiled kindly.

“No need to be so shy. Even I can see that he’s a fine young man. Moreover, his father is none other than the Sura Blade, Lee Gwak. There’s no greater background than that.”

Ban Woo-yeom turned his head to look at the receding figures of Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong.

“I don’t know why he’s going to Lake Chaohu, but soon the world will be turned upside down.”

He was a man who had already shaken the world three years ago.

Even then, his martial arts were at an incredible level, and now, three years later, one couldn’t even begin to guess how much more he had advanced.

Even though Ban Woo-yeom prided himself on his sharp insight, he couldn’t even begin to estimate the extent of Lee Gwak’s abilities.

But there was one thing he was certain of.

The world would soon tremble because of Igwak.

The path of Sura Blade had become even sharper than three years ago.

He wondered whose heart that path would pierce.

Ban Woo-yeom and Ban Seol-hwa kept watching until the figures of Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong completely disappeared.

Lake Chaohu had long been known for its scenic beauty.

The lake is shaped like a bird’s nest, hence the name.

Mountains, water, islands, forests, caves, and springs blended harmoniously to create stunning landscapes. The sight of Chaohu under the moonlight was so beautiful that it could leave one speechless.

For the people living nearby, Chaohu was not just a lake.

It was their lifeline, a symbol of abundance.

Because of this, countless martial sects had fought for control over Chaohu for generations.

A hundred years ago, it was managed by the Namgung family, and currently, the Thousand Kingdom School, which could be called the successor of the Namgung family, exerted influence.

People naturally accepted the rule of the Thousand Kingdom School.

Though the name had changed, the leader of the Thousand Kingdom School still bore the Namgung surname. To the people of Chaohu, that fact was more important than anything else.

Such was the strong nostalgia for the old Namgung Clan in Soho.

The largest manor in Soho, Crimson Lotus Manor, was also a legacy of the old Namgung Clan.

It was once the private retreat of the head of the Namgung family.

Whenever the Namgung family head needed rest, they would retreat to Crimson Lotus Manor to clear their mind. This tradition continued under Thousand Kingdom School, who sent martial artists to specially manage the estate.

There were always dozens of martial artists stationed at Crimson Lotus Manor, keeping it lively and full of energy. But now, the manor was filled with nothing but death.

The martial artists of Thousand Kingdom School had all been slaughtered, their corpses strewn across the ground, and the once pristine Crimson Lotus Manor had been trampled by invaders, desecrated.

Hundreds of men in ornate blue robes stood assembled in the central training ground of the manor.

Their blue robes were stained with blood—the blood of Thousand Kingdom School’s martial artists who had guarded the manor.

Still feeling the lingering tension of the massacre, the men were visibly excited, like predators with prey before them.

Step, step!

A man walked between them.

He was a handsome man with sharply defined jaw muscles. His bold features gave him an intense presence.

“Now we can finally begin a full-scale search.”

A cold smile appeared on the man’s lips.

His name was Go Jeon-ok, the man who had brought a storm of blood to Crimson Lotus Manor.
