Lee Gwak set out early in the morning to visit the Silver Family Iron House.

Fortunately, the Silver Family Iron House had not disappeared and still existed.

Lee Gwak opened the door and entered the shop.

The merchant, who had been organizing items on the display shelf, stopped and stared intently at Lee Gwak, recognizing his face.

“It’s been a while, Master Eun.”

“Incredible! It really is you. I heard you had returned to the Jade Heaven Alliance, but I never thought I’d see you in person.”

The merchant, surprised to see Lee Gwak, was Eun Cheol Myeong.

He was the owner of the Silver Family Iron House in Jade Heaven Alliance and had known Lee Gwak for a long time.

“Me? I’m always well. Your fame these days is soaring high. I heard you recently gave a thrashing to a young member of the Thousand Kingdom School?”

“How did you know about that?”

“How could I not? So many people witnessed it. The story is all over the streets.”

Despite the long absence, Eun Cheol Myeong hadn’t changed at all.

Eun Cheol Myeong’s gaze then shifted to the blade Lee Gwak was wearing at his waist.

“That blade looks like it was made by my uncle…”

“That’s correct. I purchased it from the Silver Family Iron House in Haenam.”

Lee Gwak readily handed the blade to Eun Cheol Myeong.

Eun Cheol Myeong drew the blade and examined it closely.

“This is one of the finer pieces my uncle made. He really put a lot of care into this.”

“I don’t know how you managed to acquire a piece made by my uncle, but you’re lucky. Such blades are not easily made, even by my uncle.”

Eun Cheol Myeong couldn’t hide his admiration as he caressed the straight blade.

Returning the blade to Lee Gwak, he continued.

“Considering you have such a blade, you must be here for something else you need?”

“We’ve got plenty of new items in stock, so feel free to look around.”

“Thank me? I should be thanking you for making a purchase. I’ll leave you to it then.”

Eun Cheol Myeong stepped back, allowing Lee Gwak to browse the items freely.

When Lee Gwak had visited before, he purchased various weapons, including a meteor awl.

Thus, Eun Cheol Myeong assumed this visit would be similar. However, he was mistaken.

Lee Gwak wasn’t selecting weapons to complement his blade but rather items necessary for spending nights outdoors.

‘He’s planning a long journey.’

It was clear from the items he chose.

The items Lee Gwak was selecting weren’t those needed by someone settling in one place. He focused on selecting items that were lightweight and portable, a clear indication of his plans.

Suddenly, Eun Cheol Myeong remembered an item that had recently come in. It wasn’t a typical item for the forge, so it had been stored away in the warehouse. Thinking about it now, it seemed perfect for Lee Gwak.

He left Lee Gwak alone for a moment and went into the warehouse. After searching, he found what he was looking for: a windbreaker made of leather.

Returning from the warehouse, he handed the leather windbreaker to Lee Gwak.

“One of the artisans here made it from bear leather. It’s treated with a special technique unique to our forge, making it impermeable to water and resistant to a fair amount of fire. Of course, it perfectly blocks the wind as well. Additionally, there are various compartments inside for storage. How about it? Isn’t this exactly what you need?”

It was indeed the ideal item for his upcoming journey, almost a treasure.

Lee Gwak caressed the surface of the windbreaker.

It was so finely crafted that the texture felt as smooth as silk.

Deciding to try it on, Lee Gwak wore the windbreaker. It was slightly bulky but perfectly concealed his entire body.

There’s a rightful owner for every proper item, and it seemed this item’s rightful owner had always been Lee Gwak.

“I don’t know where you’re headed, but I hope we can meet again.”

“I’ll return. This place is like my hometown to me. Thank you for offering such a good item.”

“Good items find their rightful owners.”

Lee Gwak genuinely felt thankful to Eun Cheol Myeong.

After settling the account, he stepped outside.

Lee Gwak looked up at the sky for a moment before moving on.

The streets had become even more crowded.

Many people passed by Lee Gwak indifferently, and he walked among them in silence.

Suddenly, Lee Gwak felt an odd sensation.

He became tense, his senses sharpened like the edge of a blade, and his heart pounded fiercely.

Caught off guard by the unfamiliar feeling, Lee Gwak furrowed his brows and looked ahead.

At that moment, Lee Gwak instinctively clenched his fist.

Among the crowd, one person stood out distinctly.

He had a face too handsome to belong to this world, exuding a decadent aura.

He resembled someone Lee Gwak knew.

He was conversing and walking with a group of young martial artists.

Noticing Lee Gwak’s gaze, the man turned his head to face forward.

Upon seeing his gaze directly, Lee Gwak realized he was not mistaken.

It was indeed Go Geom Wol, the first Prince of the Celestial Demon Troupe.

Go Geom Wol’s wavering eyes confirmed this fact.

Just as Lee Gwak recognized Go Geom Wol, Go Geom Wol also recognized him.

The distance between them gradually closed.

Neither Lee Gwak nor Go Geom Wol stopped walking, and finally, they came to a stop within a breath’s distance of each other.

Suddenly, as Go Geom Wol stopped, the two men appearing to be his companions looked puzzled.

The man who asked Go Geom Wol was Jin Woo-seon, one of the Ten Lesser Skies. After being defeated by Go Geom Wol, he had sincerely admired him and was now traveling the Jianghu together.

The other was as big as Cheol Gwang Woo.

His name was Je Mu-hyeok, the current successor of Heaven and Earth Gate. Though not well-known in the world, Go Geom Wol could attest that his skills were not inferior to those of the Ten Lesser Skies.

After being defeated by Go Geom Wol, Je Mu-hyeok also joined him on his journey.

Go Geom Wol smiled softly and said,

“I’ve unexpectedly met someone I know. You two go ahead to the lodging. I’ll have a brief talk with him and follow soon.”

Jin Woo-seon and Je Mu-hyeok looked at Lee Gwak simultaneously.

They knew Go Geom Wol’s arrogance well. He wouldn’t pay attention to anyone he didn’t deem worthy. Yet now, he was gazing at Lee Gwak with eyes as if seeing an old lover, sparking their interest.

Go Geom Wol broke the silence first.

“I heard rumors and wondered if it was true, but you’re really alive, Lee Gwak.”

“This isn’t the place for our talk. Let’s move somewhere quieter.”

Go Geom Wol started walking, Lee Gwak following with his lips tightly sealed.

Go Geom Wol’s back looked as imposing as ever, like an unyielding fortress against any trial or hardship. The sight filled Lee Gwak with a tremendous sense of pressure.

For the past six years, he thought he had significantly closed the gap between them, but facing Go Geom Wol now, he wasn’t so sure.

The two entered a dense reed field by Dongting Lake. The tall reeds concealed them completely from the outside.

Only then did Go Geom Wol turn to face Lee Gwak.

Lee Gwak, stopping as well, stared intensely back at Go Geom Wol.

For a while, they just looked at each other in silence.

Suddenly, Go Geom Wol’s lips curved into a smile, but Lee Gwak found no amusement to share.

Go Geom Wol was the first to speak.

“I’m glad to see you. Honestly, I never dreamed you would be alive. How did it happen?”

Lee Gwak’s response was brief.

Though it might have seemed rude, Go Geom Wol did not take offense.

Lee Gwak, whom he had once killed under the guise of avenging his sworn brother, was alive. Despite the past vengeance, Go Geom Wol found himself not angered but rather pleased to see Lee Gwak alive.

Go Geom Wol pondered over this peculiar feeling within him.

The sentiment was mutual for Lee Gwak.

Despite considering Go Geom Wol a lifelong adversary, at this moment, Lee Gwak felt no animosity. Instead, he was curious.

“What brings the First Prince of the Celestial Demon Troupe to the Jade Heaven Alliance?”

“I came just to see the sights.”

“Yes. It’s a rare opportunity to possibly see all the leaders of the Ten Sects at once. It’s worth the risk.”

“And if your identity is revealed? Do those accompanying you know who you are?”

Go Geom Wol’s response was nonchalant, indicating that the revelation of his identity was of little concern to him. He was confident in his ability to protect himself at any moment.

At this moment, Go Geom Wol’s attention was solely on Lee Gwak.

The Lee Gwak standing before him was no longer the same person Go Geom Wol knew in the past.

Though he had been strong before, there was always a sense of chaos about him. Now, Lee Gwak radiated a controlled aura, like a finely honed blade.

It’s said that “a martial artist should not be judged on the same scale after a separation of three days,” but Lee Gwak’s development was exceptionally rare.

This filled Go Geom Wol with both excitement and a hint of regret.

He would have liked to keep Lee Gwak by his side, much like Jin Woo-seon and Je Mu-hyeok, but he knew that was impossible.

They had already crossed swords with deadly intent.

Lee Gwak had survived a brush with death, and Go Geom Wol had been left with indelible scars.

It was impossible to patch everything up and start over as if nothing had happened.

Go Geom Wol stared intently at Lee Gwak, who did not shy away from his gaze.

The intensity of their eye contact was almost physically painful, with just a glance stirring their vital energies.

This wasn’t just about the disparity in their martial skills.

Go Geom Wol possessed a solidity that Lee Gwak lacked—a belief as firm as Mount Tai and as enduring as ancient rock.

Although the direction of that belief was unclear, it was evidently more resolute than anything Lee Gwak could follow. Yet, Lee Gwak was not intimidated.

He may not have had Go Geom Wol’s unwavering conviction, but he possessed an indomitable courage and stubbornness.

A third-rate martial artist with nothing to his name had overcome numerous trials and tribulations to stand on equal footing with Go Geom Wol.

It wasn’t by chance or luck but the inevitable result of Lee Gwak’s relentless will.

Go Geom Wol felt this willpower radiating from Lee Gwak.

Suddenly, Go Geom Wol wanted to test Lee Gwak’s martial arts.

As his mind moved, so did his body and Qi.

Crackling sounds erupted between them as their formless Qi clashed.

Even though the reeds concealed them, anyone would notice if they unleashed their martial arts. But manipulating their qi was different.

The surrounding reeds swirled in the air.

Any reed caught between them disintegrated into dust instantly.

Go Geom Wol’s Qi was like cold fire—intense yet calm and heated.

In contrast, Lee Gwak’s Qi resembled boiling water.

The qi built by the Eight Snakes Art moved ceaselessly like a serpent, undulating like water, yet it was tumultuous.

Overall, Go Geom Wol seemed to dominate, but Lee Gwak was not simply overpowered.

The great serpent advanced, devouring the cold fire-like Qi of Go Geom Wol. It was just that Go Gom Wol’s energy was so vast it couldn’t be consumed all at once.

For the first time, a deep furrow formed on Go Geom Wol’s brow.

Lee Gwak’s unique Qi felt unsettling to him.

Only then did Go Geom Wol realize that Lee Gwak’s internal energy was distinct from ordinary martial arts.

A recollection flashed through Go Geom Wol’s mind.

“The world works in strange ways. It doesn’t leave anything outstanding alone. When a being of great destiny appears, the world balances it by introducing another entity to counter it. Ironically, though.”

Those were casual words once spoken by Go Geom Wol.

But as it turns out, words can become seeds. Perhaps Lee Gwak’s internal energy was the exact counter to his own.

Go Geom Wol suddenly burst into laughter.

His laughter caused the reed bed to sway tumultuously.
