“What is this?”

Seop Yu-saeng looked at the innocent-faced big man standing behind Lee Gwak with an expression of bewilderment. The big man replied bluntly.

“And what about you?”

“You look so pale…….”

“A guy who looks like a gigolo…”

“A bear with nothing but size.”

Cheol Gwang Woo and Seop Yu-saeng growled at each other as if they were natural enemies from the moment they met.

Lee Gwak, sitting down, introduced him.

“He’s my younger brother, who will be joining us.”

“Younger brother? I didn’t know you had one.”

“There were circumstances.”

“Good grief!”

Seop Yu-saeng clicked his tongue.

Cheol Gwang Woo sat next to Lee Gwak as if it was the most natural thing in the world. His massive build blocked the window, casting a thick shadow.

Naturally, Seop Yu-saeng’s face contorted. His pleasant sunbathing was interrupted by Cheol Gwang Woo’s size.

Seop Yu-saeng sighed and put down his drink.

“Sigh! Whatever the reason, if you’re traveling with this fellow, you’re going to attract a lot of attention.”

Cheol Gwang Woo was bigger than any giant Seop Yu-saeng had seen before. Naturally, traveling with a man of such size would draw people’s eyes.

“What’s so bad about getting attention? Don’t worry about it, brother. I, Cheol Gwang Woo, will take good care of you.”

“Tsk! A big guy who’s as foolish as he is large. Do you think attracting attention in the Jianghu is always a good thing?”

“What? Foolish?”

“Yes! You fool.”

Cheol Gwang Woo bristled and stood up.

That’s when Lee Gwak spoke.

“Sit down.”

“But brother!”

“Are you planning not to listen to me already? If that’s the case, there’s no need for you to follow me.”

“No, brother.”

Cheol Gwang Woo’s face turned pale.

His greatest fear was incurring Lee Gwak’s displeasure. He admired and liked Lee Gwak that much.

Cheol Gwang Woo’s mother moved houses. They moved to an area in Leizhou where high-ranking officials lived, a place with good public order where vagrants or Jianghu riffraff couldn’t easily approach.

All this was possible thanks to a token Lee Gwak had given them.

Cheol Gwang Woo considered Lee Gwak a benefactor for life. He was the first to bestow such a favor without asking for anything in return.

Seeing Cheol Gwang Woo instantly become obedient at Lee Gwak’s words, Seop Yu-saeng couldn’t help but wear a bewildered expression.

He found it amusing how Cheol Gwang Woo, who would usually retort fiercely, acted so docile like a puppy towards Lee Gwak.

If Cheol Gwang Woo had a tail, it would be wagging furiously by now.

Cheol Gwang Woo bowed his head to Seop Yu-saeng, apologizing.

“I’m sorry. It was my fault.”

“I’m sorry too. I went too far.”

Seop Yu-saeng also apologized to Cheol Gwang Woo.

Upon reflection, he realized his reaction was also over the top. It was unlike him.

Seop Yu-saeng soon understood why.

There was a certain energy emanating from Cheol Gwang Woo that irritated his nerves. Cheol Gwang Woo’s energy was rough and fierce.

It was due to the harmony between Cheol Gwang Woo’s temperament and the Vajra Demon Shadow Technique.

He had yet to master the Vajra Demon Shadow Technique properly. Hence, his energy was rough and unstable.

It was the complete opposite of Seop Yu-saeng, who preferred stability.

That was also the reason Lee Gwak insisted on taking Cheol Gwang Woo with him.

The Vajra Demon Shadow Technique was a unique and powerful technique.

If he didn’t deeply understand the principles of Buddhist philosophy, he would be consumed by the heart demons and turn into a devil himself.

If Cheol Gwang Woo turned into a devil, it would be a great disaster for the world.

The Vajra Demon Shadow Technique was powerful in itself, but more importantly, it was very compatible with Cheol Gwang Woo. Together, they could match the power of any other supreme martial art in the world.

Lee Gwak saw the image of Gwang Noh ya in Cheol Gwang Woo.

Gwang Noh ya, who had become mad, deeply regretted the great harm he had caused to the world. His wrong choice had led to the deaths and suffering of many.

Though no one held him accountable, the guilt always weighed heavily on his heart.

Having observed for six years, Lee Gwak knew how painful it was.

Lee Gwak hoped that young Cheol Gwang Woo would not live a life filled with regret like Gwang Noh ya. That’s why he took Cheol Gwang Woo as a brother.

“Let’s eat first.”

At Lee Gwak’s words, Cheol Gwang Woo swallowed his saliva.

He didn’t say it, but he was starving on the way here.

At Lee Gwak’s signal, the innkeeper approached.

“What would you like to order?”

“Just bring us the ten best dishes this place has to offer.”

“Ten dishes? That’s a lot… Understood. I’ll make sure to bring a generous amount.”

The innkeeper looked worried but then understood after seeing Cheol Gwang Woo’s massive stature.

Cheol Gwang Woo smiled happily.

Cheol Gwang Woo, who had an appetite as enormous as his stature, was always hungry no matter how much he ate.

Because of this, he often had to be mindful of his mother’s gaze even at home when eating, but he couldn’t help feeling happy since Lee Gwak had ordered plenty of food without any conditions.

Seop Yu-saeng patted Lee Gwak on the shoulder.

“Feeding that bear-like guy is going to cost you a lot. Can you handle it?”

“Well, we’ll manage somehow.”

Lee Gwak calmly replied.

Having given most of the voucher to Cheol Gwang Woo’s mother, there wasn’t much money left.

If they continued ordering food like this, they would run out of money before even getting halfway to Jade Heaven Alliance. Still, Lee Gwak wasn’t too worried.

Thinking about it, his life hadn’t been abundant with money. He had managed to live without money, and when pushed into a corner, a way always seemed to appear.

Seop Yu-saeng clicked his tongue at Lee Gwak’s calm demeanor.

“Tch! You really are something. Living like that without a plan, one day you’ll end up in rags.”

“Well, at least my mind is at ease.”

“Do you want me to lend you some?”

“No need. It’s not much, but I still have some travel money left.”

“If you feel it’s not enough, just tell me.”

“Thank you for the offer.”

“It’s not just empty words.”

Lee Gwak smiled.

Although Lee Gwak had not known Seop Yu-saeng for long, he was well aware of how good a person he was.

For Lee Gwak, meeting someone as good as Seop Yu-saeng upon returning to the Jianghu was a great fortune.

Lee Gwak and Seop Yu-saeng chatted amiably.

Cheol Gwang Woo sat quietly, listening to their conversation. In reality, he was just quietly waiting for the food.

When the innkeeper brought the food, Cheol Gwang Woo’s mouth opened wide in anticipation. Cheol Gwang Woo ate voraciously, as if possessed.

Seop Yu-saeng couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight.

“Ha! I’m not going to snatch it away, so eat slowly.”

While Cheol Gwang Woo was busy indulging in the food, Seop Yu-saeng and Lee Gwak shared a few drinks.

As the alcohol made them feel slightly tipsy, Seop Yu-saeng, feeling spirited, suddenly started to play the lute he was carrying and sang.

‘Born a man, I’ve wandered the world all my life,

Yet, nowhere can I comfortably rest my body.

Oh, passing time, how regretful.

What have I done so wrong to pass by so helplessly?

My ambition remains the same, yet this body is no longer what it once was.

Youth lasts but a season, why didn’t I realize it then?

With white hair under my ears now plentiful, I finally understand the good old days.’

The mournful sound of the lute and his voice blended beautifully.

People inside the inn stopped their meals to watch Seop Yu-saeng.

With his eyes gently closed as he played, Seop Yu-saeng seemed almost transcendent, like an immortal.

His song touched hearts so deeply that even Cheol Gwang Woo stopped eating to gaze blankly at him.

Lee Gwak too closed his eyes to savor Seop Yu-saeng’s song.

The more he reflected on it, the more Seop Yu-saeng’s song resonated with him.

When Seop Yu-saeng’s song finally ended, there was a moment.

“What an incredible song.”

The guests inside the inn sent up a roar of applause.

“One can’t simply sit still after hearing such a song. Hey, innkeeper. Send a bottle of the inn’s finest wine to that table over there.”

“I’ll send a bottle of wine too.”

Some generous patrons ordered wine to be sent to Seop Yu-saeng’s table. Some even boasted they would cover his meal expenses.

Pleased with the response, Seop Yu-saeng sang another tune, brightening the atmosphere in the inn even more.

Seop Yu-saeng’s song was very serene, perhaps that’s why it stirred deep thoughts.

‘Really profound cultivation.’

Lee Gwak couldn’t help but admire.

Seop Yu-saeng’s song encapsulated the essence of the musical cultivation he had mastered.

Without even infusing his internal energy, it moved people’s hearts; it was hard to imagine the power it could unleash with internal energy.

Cheol Gwang Woo’s view of Seop Yu-saeng also changed.

Until a moment ago, he thought of him as a bothersome know-it-all, but now he saw him as a more capable musician.

“After playing a tune for the first time in a while, my throat feels a bit rough.”

Before him now stood numerous bottles of wine sent by the guests.

Seop Yu-saeng stood up, made a fist-and-palm salute to the guests who sent the wine, and thanked them.

“Thank you very much for sending such gifts for my modest song. I will enjoy this wine. May you all receive great fortune.”

“Ha ha ha!”

“If it’s not too much, sing another tune. We’ll send you as much wine as you want.”

The guests gave Seop Yu-saeng a thumbs-up.

Seop Yu-saeng smiled and poured the wine sent by the guests into his cup, then drank.

“Ah! That’s good. What’s there in life? It’s moments like these that make it worth living.”

While Seop Yu-saeng’s reputation resonated throughout the Jianghu, he himself found happiness in these simple everyday moments.

He offered Lee Gwak a cup.

“Have a drink.”

Lee Gwak nodded and extended his cup.

As their cups clinked, emitting a clear sound, suddenly the door of the inn opened and a group of people rushed in.

“What’s this?”

The guests inside the inn gasped in fear at the menacing aura exuding from the newcomers.

They were notorious vagrants from the Vagrant Market.

One of the vagrants pointed at Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo, shouting, “Those are the ones, boss.”

The pointing outlaw was none other than the nefarious Seok Mo-sam.

Seok Mo-sam’s gaze towards Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo was filled with malicious intent.

Just like his nickname, the evil spirit, Seok Mo-sam was not one to easily forget a grudge. No matter how trivial, he felt compelled to settle scores.

Although there was no official leader of the Vagrant Market, there were still dominant forces within it. One of them was the person Seok Mo-sam had brought along.

This person was a middle-aged man radiating an extraordinary aura, clearly not someone to be taken lightly.

He was a well-known presence in the Vagrant Market.

Rumors had it that he made significant contributions during the war with the Celestial Demon Troupe and received substantial rewards from the Jade Heaven Alliance.

Acknowledged by Jade Heaven Alliance, he was undoubtedly the top among the vagrants.

The reason he ended up in this place, holding such influence and power in the Vagrant Market of Leizhou, was unclear, but it was evident he was a master of great influence and skill.

Cheol Gwang Woo had caused trouble when this man was not in Leizhou, having been away on a mission to protect merchants.

He had only returned this afternoon.

Seok Mo-sam had exaggeratedly recounted his ordeal to him, insisting that to maintain the dignity of the Vagrant Market, Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo must be punished.

The middle-aged man glanced in the direction Seok Mo-sam pointed, his face full of annoyance.

He was displeased with the current situation. Although he came because Seok Mo-sam made a fuss, he was only filled with irritation and wished to settle the matter quickly and rest.

The middle-aged man strode towards the table where Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo were seated.

Seok Mo-sam’s lips curled into a cold smile at the sight.

‘This is the end for you both.’

If he couldn’t avenge himself directly, involving others to settle his grudge was his way.

Though Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo were strong, they would not be able to defeat the hostile middle-aged man.

Seok Mo-sam had once witnessed the middle-aged man’s martial prowess, which was utterly overwhelming.

Such martial might could only be seen among the strongest factions like the Ten Sects. It was far beyond the level of ordinary vagrants.

Seok Mo-sam watched eagerly, hoping Lee Gwak and Cheol Gwang Woo would provoke the middle-aged man’s temper.

The hostile middle-aged man spoke up, “I’ve heard you committed unprovoked murder in the Vagrant Market. Is this true?”

“What nonsense? You were the ones who provoked us first.”

Just as Seok Mo-sam expected, Cheol Gwang Woo was about to react aggressively, but Lee Gwak held him back with a hand, making Cheol Gwang Woo sit down cautiously like a puppy trying to avoid trouble.

Lee Gwak slowly turned to face the middle-aged man.

At that moment, the middle-aged man’s eyes widened in surprise.
