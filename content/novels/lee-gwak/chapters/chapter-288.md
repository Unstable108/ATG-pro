Thud!

Dan Li-yeon fell to her knees.

She looked down at her chest in disbelief. Lee Gwak’s blade was embedded there.

The sight of her red blood staining the silver blade seemed surreal.

Dan Li-yeon blinked.

Her vision was gradually blurring.

She barely lifted her head to look up at Lee Gwak.

His expression was different from what she had expected.

She had thought Lee Gwak would wear a proud expression, but instead, he looked at her with a troubled face.

“Guh…!”

Dan Li-yeon coughed up blood.

The red blood stained her chin and chest.

An ordinary person would have already lost consciousness or died, but Dan Li-yeon held on through sheer mental strength.

There was something she absolutely had to ask.

“W… what sword technique is that?”

She was a martial artist to the core.

Even with her life hanging by a thread, she was more curious about her opponent’s martial arts.

Lee Gwak’s tightly shut lips finally parted.

“It’s… the Heaven Killing Blade.”

“Heaven Killing Blade? It suits you… truly…”

“…”

“Why did you leave? A hero like you should have been with the Jade Heaven Alliance. If you’d stayed, Master wouldn’t have gone berserk like this.”

“Lady Dan…”

“I… resent you.”

Dan Li-yeon looked at Lee Gwak with bloodshot eyes, but then her eyes rolled back, and she lost consciousness.

“Third Lady!”

“My Lady!”

The remaining members of the Ghost Sword Squad who were still alive rushed over.

Lee Gwak pulled the dagger from Dan Li-yeon’s chest and stepped back.

Some embraced Dan Li-yeon, while others guarded against Lee Gwak.

Their eyes held both resentment and fear as they looked at him.

Not only had they lost their comrades and their leader, Ok Mu-yeon, to Lee Gwak, but Dan Li-yeon had also suffered a critical injury.

Her breathing was faint; if left as is, she would surely die.

Even if everyone else perished, they had to save Dan Li-yeon at all costs.

Some might say that all lives are equal, but in truth, there are lives that weigh more than others.

Dan Li-yeon was someone who absolutely must not die.

Even though there had been minor conflicts with the squad leader Ok Mu-yeon, such matters were insignificant.

Those who had been supporting Dan Li-yeon quickly retreated, while those who blocked Lee Gwak charged at him, disregarding their own lives.

Clang! Clang!

Lee Gwak swung his blade, fending off their attacks.

“Ugh!”

“Agh!”

After a few exchanges, they screamed and were thrown back.

In an instant, Lee Gwak had dealt with the Ghost Sword Squad, and he turned to look at those fleeing.

They were running away with all their might, not daring to look back, in order to save Dan Li-yeon.

Lee Gwak didn’t bother to pursue them.

In fact, the wound he had inflicted on Dan Li-yeon wasn’t that fatal. Although her chest was pierced, he had avoided the vital points.

The real issue was the Art of Potential Amplification that Dan Li-yeon had used.

To amplify her strength temporarily, she had drawn upon her innate qi, a natural life force that could never be replenished once used.

An elderly person passing away is also due to the complete exhaustion of this innate qi.

Dan Li-yeon had used up most of hers.

Even if she was lucky enough to survive, she wouldn’t be able to wield martial arts as before.

It was akin to a death sentence for a martial artist.

For someone who had devoted her entire life solely to martial arts, there was no punishment greater than this.

Especially for someone like Dan Li-yeon, who was so obsessed with martial arts that she was called a “Martial Maniac,” losing her skills was a punishment worse than death.

That’s why Lee Gwak had spared her life.

Sigh.

Lee Gwak let out a heavy sigh.

His heart felt heavy.

It was easier to fight someone he had no connection to, but fighting someone bound to him by past ties wore him down emotionally.

He shook his head and looked behind him.

“Father!”

Lee Cheong was holding Cho Ryu-jin’s corpse, looking at Lee Gwak. Lee Cheong’s face was streaked with tears, and his eyes were swollen.

Cho Ryu-jin’s death had been a tremendous shock to him.

During their journey, Lee Cheong had grown quite close to Cho Ryu-jin.

Though Lee Cheong had experienced many hardships at a young age, losing someone close to him like this was a first. The shock was inevitably greater.

“Ah…”

Lee Gwak sighed once more.

Cho Ryu-jin’s death would greatly affect not only himself but also Lee Cheong.

As an adult who had been through much, he could overcome it. But for young Lee Cheong, it was impossible to predict what memories it would leave or how it would affect him.

Lee Gwak could only hope that Lee Cheong would overcome it well.

Cho Ryu-jin had died with his eyes wide open. Lee Gwak reached out and gently closed his eyes.

“Father, what are we going to do about brother? Such a kind person… We were almost at his maternal home…”

“Cheong-ah!”

“If only I were stronger, I could have protected him. Why am I so weak in martial arts…?”

“It’s not your fault. You did your part. If anyone is to blame for Ryu-jin’s death, it’s me. Had I been more vigilant, he wouldn’t have died.”

“Father?”

“Ryu-jin wouldn’t want us to dwell in guilt. Let’s go.”

“To… where?”

“To the Hwang Family Manor. The place Ryu-jin wanted to reach.”

Lee Gwak picked up Cho Ryu-jin’s body.

Lee Cheong wiped his tears and nodded.

The two of them mounted their horses and headed to the Hwang Family Manor.

Finding it wasn’t difficult; it was the largest estate in Lake Hong.

Lee Gwak knocked on the gate, and the chief attendant came out.

Seeing Cho Ryu-jin’s body, the attendant was in shock.

The head of the Hwang Family Manor and its members rushed out.

Upon hearing the news of Cho Ryu-jin’s death and the massacre at the Cho Family Manor, they wept in grief. Their anguished cries pierced the hearts of Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong.

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong bid farewell to the members of the Hwang Family Manor and left the state. The owner urged them to stay for a few days, but Lee Gwak politely declined.

Even after handing over Cho Ryu-jin’s body, their hearts remained heavy.

The suffocating feeling in their chests didn’t easily dissipate.

“Sob!”

Lee Cheong wept in Lee Gwak’s arms.

Without a word, Lee Gwak patted his back and looked up at the sky.

Lee Cheong was bedridden for two whole days.

He had a severe fever and was so delirious that he couldn’t move. Because of this, Lee Gwak couldn’t leave Lake Hong immediately and had to stay at a nearby inn.

He worried that Lee Cheong’s old illness had relapsed. But fortunately, it hadn’t. On the third day, Lee Cheong suddenly got up as if nothing had happened.

His face was full of energy, as if he had never been sick. His gaze seemed calmer and deeper than before.

Lee Gwak noticed this change in him.

It was clear that Cho Ryu-jin’s death had caused significant inner growth in Lee Cheong, just as it had affected himself.

The idea that someone’s death could become nourishment for another’s mental growth seemed contradictory and unfair. But Lee Gwak knew well that the world didn’t always operate rationally.

Some people, even in the same situation, couldn’t overcome their inner turmoil and collapsed, while others used it as fuel to rise even higher.

Fortunately, Lee Cheong seemed to be the latter.

Smiling, Lee Cheong said, “You were very worried, weren’t you?”

“Not really.”

“I’m sorry.”

Lee Cheong smiled.

It was a smile that somehow seemed more mature than before.

Watching his smile for a moment, Lee Gwak spoke, “If you’re feeling better, let’s head out.

We’ve stayed here too long.”

“Yes!”

Lee Cheong readily nodded.

Together, they left the inn.

Neigh!

As they approached the stable, the horses neighed as if welcoming them.

Because Lee Cheong had been bedridden for two days, the horses had been confined to the stable without moving.

“Sorry! It must’ve been stuffy for you, right?”

Lee Cheong patted his horse’s neck.

The horse closed its eyes and shook its head, as if understanding him.

“Let’s go!”

Lee Gwak and Lee Cheong mounted their horses and took off at full speed.

They had no specific destination in mind.

Lee Cheong occasionally glanced back to make sure Lee Gwak was following and pushed his horse to its limits.

A strong headwind battered Lee Chung’s entire body but he didn’t slow down.

Lee Cheong’s gallop continued for quite a while.

Eventually, after nearly half a day, they stopped at the lower reaches of Lake Hong.

The horses were exhausted, foaming at the mouth.

Only then did Lee Cheong realize he had been too self-absorbed, and he wore an apologetic expression.

“Sorry! I was only thinking about myself.”

Prrr!

The horse snorted heavily, panting.

Lee Gwak dismounted and spoke.

“The horses must be tired. Let’s rest here for a while.”

“I’m sorry, Father!”

“It’s alright.”

Lee Gwak patted Lee Cheong’s head.

They sat on a nearby rock and took out rice balls prepared at the inn. Though plain, with just a sprinkle of salt, the rice balls tasted delicious.

The rice ball in Lee Chung’s hand, about the size of a child’s fist, disappeared in an instant. Having barely eaten while he’d been bedridden, he was extremely hungry.

“Here, eat this too.”

Lee Gwak handed him the remaining half of his rice ball.

“I’m fine.”

“I had plenty for breakfast. Go on, eat.”

Lee Gwak pressed the rice ball into his son’s hand.

Lee Cheong looked at him for a moment, then nodded slightly and ate it.

Lee Gwak watched with a smile as Lee Cheong chewed.

Just watching his son eat made him feel full.

Still smiling, Lee Gwak looked around at the surrounding scenery.

He saw the vast Lake Hong and numerous boats coming and going on it.

Although the Jianghu was engulfed in extreme chaos, this place seemed to be away from the center of the turmoil. The faces of the people on the boats didn’t appear so gloomy.

Lee Gwak watched them for quite some time.

“Father!”

At that moment, Lee Cheong’s voice broke Lee Gwak out of his thoughts.

When he turned, Lee Cheong asked cautiously.

“What will you do now?”

“I’m thinking of heading to the Hao Clan.”

“Hao Clan?”

“I’d like to see Brother Woo Gyeong.”

Nam Woo Gyeong was the most knowledgeable person about the affairs of the Jianghu that Lee Gwak knew. He also possessed keen insight.

He wanted to meet him after a long time and seek his advice.

As he stood up, Lee Gwak said, “While we’re at it, let’s visit the branch office of the Hao Clan.”

The branches of the Hao Clan were spread all over the Jianghu.

Surely there would be at least one branch near Lake Hong. If he went to the Hao Clan’s branch, he could get news about Nam Woo-gyeong.

With their plan set, there was no reason to delay.

Just then, Lee Cheong had also finished eating his rice ball.

Without waiting, Lee Gwak stood up.

Finding the Hao Clan’s branch at Lake Hong was not difficult. Lake Hong was the largest lake in the area, and being close to the sea, numerous merchant ships came and went.

The gathering of merchant ships meant that bustling commercial districts were developed, and it was evidence that wealth circulated abundantly. And the Hao Clan always had branches in such places.

The more money circulated in a place, the larger the Hao Clan’s branch would be. So they were easy to find.

Moreover, in Lee Gwak’s case, he had learned from Nam Woo-gyeong how to find the hidden branches of the Hao Clan. Thanks to that, he could easily find the Hao Clan’s branch at Lake Hong.

“Are you really Grandmaster Lee Gwak?”

The branch manager asked with an expression of disbelief.

He had already heard the news that Lee Gwak had returned to the martial world, but he never dreamed that he would appear at the very Lake Hong where he was the branch manager.

“Yes, I am Lee Gwak.”

“What brings you all the way here, Master Lee?”

“I stopped by briefly on some business. By any chance, could you tell me where Brother Nam Woo-gyeong is currently staying?”

“You mean… the Young Master?”

“Yes.”

“The Young Master is currently staying near the Nine Dragons Clan.”

“Nine Dragons Clan?”

Lee Gwak furrowed his brow.

Another name for the Nine Dragons Clan was the Northern Overlord.

It was one of the Seven supreme sects.
