After leaving the area where Pan Buwang was, Yun Che did not disperse the abyss dust covering his body, but continued to move forward. There, it was the deeper part of the fog sea.

"Where are you going?" Li Suo suddenly spoke, with undisguised vigilance.

Yun Che looked at the increasingly deep abyss dust in front of him, and his feet did not stop: "It's time to go deeper to have a look."

Li Suo was silent for a while, and said uncertainly: "Could it be that you want to..."

"Yes, it's what you think."

Yun Che raised his hand, with a smile on his face, and his demeanor was calm as if he was narrating a trivial matter: "It's time to try to control the abyss beasts in the extreme realm of God."

Yun Che's control of the abyss beasts in recent years has continued from the early stage of God Destruction Realm to the late stage of God Destruction Realm. It took less than four years in total. The speed of growth is terrifying. But it has always been limited to the scope of God Destruction Realm. As for the Abyss Kirin God, it is completely an accident derived from the unextinguished Kirin will.
"You have been deliberately suppressing your realm. In your current state, it is too dangerous to encounter any God Realm Abyss Beast."

Li Suo dissuaded... Although her dissuasion had never worked on Yun Che.

"It's not that dangerous."

Yun Che said lightly: "Although I don't have much confidence in controlling the Abyss Beasts of the God Realm, I am confident that they will not release their destructive instincts on me. After all, I am the Emperor of the Sea of ​​Mist."

Li Suo was still worried and said: "You only proclaimed yourself. The Abyss Beasts of the Sea of ​​Mist have not recognized you, so you must not take it lightly."

"...It doesn't matter!"

Yun Che seemed to be stabbed by Li Suo's words, and his eyes became a little darker: "A small Creator God of Life dares to question the power of this emperor! You wait, I will let you see how the Abyss Beasts of the God Realm bow down to me soon!"

Li Suo: "..."

Six hours later... Yun Che rushed out of the Abyss Mist with a dusty face, and then sat on the ground and gasped for breath. It took him a long time to barely catch his breath. If Yun Che could control the abyss beasts of the God Realm, it would undoubtedly be a huge help to Yun Che. However, Yun Che's body was too fragile to face the power of the God Realm.
Even if he lost control a little, it would be a disaster for him now. Li Suo appeared, and the purest light power in the world covered him, making Yun Che feel like he was bathing in a holy spring. The wounds on his body healed at a speed visible to the naked eye, and even his broken hair grew back.
"If you insist on trying again, you'd better bring the Ancestral Kirin God with you." Li Suo persuaded.
These words fell into the ears of the Mist Emperor, and were simply a mockery of his "endless power" and his previous arrogant words.
His eyes were cold, and he said calmly: "I just miscalculated a little. At most one month, before I set foot in the Pure Land, I must at least successfully control it..."

After a few breaths, his voice was still powerful: "A Divine Abyss Beast!"

Li Suo thought about it and chose to comfort him: "Well, it will succeed."

Very wisely, he did not continue on this topic. Yun Che sat up straight, and as the scarlet sword light appeared, the Heaven Smiting Demon Slayer Sword was placed in front of him. As his other hand covered, another... "Heaven Smiting Demon Slayer Sword" appeared, fitting tightly with the previous one, with sword light matching and aura blending. The same wide sword body, from the tip of the sword, the sword body to the round bead on the hilt, are exactly the same.

They release almost indistinguishable scarlet sword light, and carry a faint sacred aura. At least, from the appearance and sword aura, it is difficult to distinguish them. Of course, Yun Che can identify them in an instant. When the sword power explodes, the two are even more different.
After staring at the two "Heaven Smiting Devil Slaying Swords" for a long time, Yun Che suddenly frowned, grabbed the sword on the right side, and slammed down on the other "Heaven Smiting Devil Slaying Sword". The sound of power exploded with a heart-shaking sound of breaking. Under the Heaven Smiting Sword, the vermilion sword body broke in the middle, and fine cracks spread in mid-air. When it fell to the ground, countless vermilion fragments had already been scattered. The Heaven Smiting Sword Aura and the Holy Aura of Light sealed in it also completely dissipated.
Li Suo looked sideways, very surprised by Yun Che's action: "In order to forge this sword, you spent a lot of effort to find the red crystal, and it took two years to immerse and seal the sword aura of the Heaven Smiting Sword. You also poured the power of light hundreds of times, and finally got the result today. Why did you suddenly destroy it?"

Yun Che said: "I spent a lot of effort to simulate a sword with a shape and aura that are completely similar to the Heaven Smiting Sword, in order to leave no flaws. But during this period of time, I have been thinking about it repeatedly... Its existence may become another bigger flaw."

"After weighing the pros and cons, I think I should choose another way."

Putting away the Heaven Smiting Demon Slayer Sword and clearing away the red debris on the ground, he whispered to Li Suo: "I am going to find a suitable time to 'abandon' it."

Li Suo sighed faintly... He has endless thoughts every day. Is there really no time when he is exhausted and about to collapse... The Seven-Star Heaven Smiting Formation in the Heaven-Breaking Divine Kingdom. The star formation shines, and endless sword light swirls. Each of these sword beams came from Hua Qingying, and each of them was a cruel test.
If you can't understand the sword meaning and integrate the sword power, even if you lack one of them, you will never be able to break out of the formation. Now, the sword beams released by this huge sword formation are already as bright as thousands of stars, reflecting a layer of faint light on the sky of the entire Zhetian Divine Kingdom. Finally, the last sword beam suddenly shone, leaving the huge star formation without a single flaw.
The next moment, thousands of swords rang together, and the entire huge star formation hung upside down and flew straight into the sky. Then it circled around, like the moon surrounded by stars, and a girl's figure was reflected in the center of the star formation. The girl raised her eyes, and the overly bright and beautiful scenery at that moment instantly dimmed the thousands of sword beams.
The jade sword in her hand also circled with a divine light far brighter than before. Where the sword tip pointed, all the sword beams in the star formation tilted flat and flew straight to Hua Qingying in the distant sky. Hua Qingying did not move, but flicked her jade hand. The sword light stopped obediently in front of her, and then slowly faded like melting ice and snow until it completely disappeared, just like a fleeting dream that had never really existed.

"Aunt!"

The girl's figure had already pounced on her, and she threw herself into her arms like a fluttering jade butterfly: "I miss you so much."

Hua Qingying gently held the girl's jade back, her heart was beating, and she whispered: "You have cultivated the third sword of the broken sky. This time, Emperor Yuan will definitely be amazed by you."

The girl raised her eyes in her arms, but she was not happy because of her aunt's praise, but said abruptly: "Is Brother Yun okay now? Has he encountered... frustration or bullying in the Kingdom of Dream Weaving?"

It was only the second sentence after breaking the star array, and she was so impatient. Hua Qingying was still thinking that three years of practicing breaking the array would definitely make her sword heart more tenacious and solid, and gradually far away from all thoughts and emotions. But the fact is obviously not the case.
"He's fine, better than you thought. Moreover, he has found his past and his destiny."

The first half of Hua Qingying's words dissipated most of the worry in her eyes, and the second half of the words made her eyes full of doubt: "Brother Yun's... past?"

"Your father's accidental encounter back then may have been guided by fate."

Hua Qingying said: "After Yun Che arrived at the Dreamweaver Kingdom, he discovered that his true identity was the Dreamweaver God's son Meng Jianyuan who disappeared that year."

"Huh?? Ah?"

Hua Caili was obviously stunned and couldn't come back to her senses for a while.
"Although this may sound strange at first, it was confirmed by the Dreamless God himself, so it is certain."
Hua Qingying said calmly: "Moreover, when he was tested for his godhood, he showed a perfect godhood like yours, which shocked the six kingdoms of God."
"In the three years you have been concentrating on the formation, his name has been resounding throughout the world, and everyone knows it. In the Dreamweaver God Kingdom, not only will he not be bullied, but he can bully anyone he wants. So, you can put all your worries aside."
Hua Qingying's description was brief and direct, but it took Hua Caili a long time to react. She was a little dazed and said: "In other words, Brother Yun... he is now... the Son of Dreamweaver?"
Hua Qingying sighed and said: "You know he has no memory before the age of ten, so he can't remember that he was Meng Jianyuan, and he values ​​his teacher too much. Even in front of the Dreamless God, he did not give in and said that he would never give up the name of 'Yun Che' before recovering his memory, and at the same time he would not I wish to become the Son of the Goddess of Dream Weaving. "

Hua Qingying's words did not surprise Hua Caili at all. Instead, she smiled, her beautiful eyes filled with mist: "Brother Yun has always been this kind of person, the most affectionate, the most intelligent and the most foolish. The title of the Son of God, which others cannot hope for, is far from shaking his sincerity. "

"However, although he is not the Son of the Goddess of Dream Weaving now, with his perfect godhood and the undisguised favor of the God of No Dream, in the eyes of the world, he is also. In addition, I don't know what method Yun Che used. According to the information I know, Meng Jianxi, who was extremely wary and hostile to Yun Che, is now very obedient to him. She has even told her mother clan more than once that she is willing to help Yun Che in the future. "

The girl's beautiful eyes have turned into a beautiful and endless sea of ​​stars, with happy blazing stars, proud bright stars, excited tear stars... filling all her heart and soul, but each of them reflects the name of Yun Che.
"Aunt... so... between me and Brother Yun..."

"Yeah."

Hua Qingying patted the girl's shoulder. She felt her endless joy, but this joy also made her feel a little distressed: "The barrier of identity between you no longer exists. If there is no marriage contract granted by the Abyss Emperor, as children of the God, and both of you have perfect godhood, your union will not attract any doubts and criticisms."

"The biggest obstacle still exists, but it is much better than it was three years ago. Your father God His acceptance of Yun Che is much better than before. In the past three years, he has been paying attention to Yun Che's information in the Kingdom of Dreamweaver, and even went to visit him in person. "

Hua Caili's eyebrows were curved: "Father God has always been like this, always likes to say heavy words, but in fact he is the softest."

With a light smile, she flew down: "I will go to see Father God first. It's the first time I haven't seen him for so long, I really miss him."

Hua Qingying did not follow her. She silently watched Hua Caili's figure going away, and was a little dazed for a while. She has always believed that the heart of the sword cannot be covered with dust. To achieve the ultimate sword, all desires and unnecessary emotions must be eliminated. Her sword progress is so fast that she surpasses Hua Fuchen and her ancestors from generation to generation, until she stepped on the top of the world, which made the priests amazed... This made her more convinced and determined about the "ruthless" swordsmanship she upholds.

Hua Qingying's eyes Hua Caili is a real freak. All her talents are above hers... including her swordsmanship talent. And she clearly realized that her sword cultivation had completely transformed after meeting Yun Che. Hua Caili's dustless sword heart, which was originally isolated from all other thoughts under her guidance, was deeply engraved with Yun Che's shadow... Then, she mastered three swords in three years, the sword of the broken sky, which was difficult to make an inch in a thousand years.
So... the ruthless sword way that abandons all desires and emotions... is it wrong... "Hahaha! Congratulations to Caili for breaking the eighth star array again! We are really surprised... Eh? Where is Caili?" All seven great sword masters came, without a single one absent, but Hua Caili was not seen. They knew better than anyone what the eighth star array set up by Hua Qingying personally meant.
Hua Qingying said, "Everyone return to the Sword Pavilion and wait for orders. The God should announce this trip to the Pure Land in the near future."

"Qingying,"

Tianshu Sword Master stroked his white beard and said meaningfully, "Are you going with me on this trip to the Pure Land?"

After a few breaths, Hua Qingying replied indifferently, "Yes."

...Star Moon Divine Kingdom.

"Brother Buwang, is it really you?!" Shaxing came to Pan Buwang quickly, looked him up and down, and his eyes were indescribably complicated.

Pan Buwang not only lost the title of Son of God, but also his mother passed away, his father God despised him, and even the person he loved was abolished and killed. From the Son of the Owl Butterfly God to the abandoned son of the Owl Butterfly, his ups and downs in fate clearly explained to the world what it means to fall from heaven to hell. At this moment, Pan Buwang in front of him no longer had any of the high spirits of the past, and his whole aura was dark and gloomy. Not to mention the majesty of the Son of God, even his outer garments were full of tatters and bloodstains, as if he had just walked out of a dark and bloody quagmire. His pupils were no longer the arrogant black star of the past, but a gray and hazy turbidity that was difficult to distinguish the bright light. Shaxing sighed in his heart... Even if he lost the title of Son of God, his status should be much higher than other emperors, but he actually... fell to this point... After learning that he had gone to Shenmeng Valley and appeared in the fog sea, the Xiaodie Divine Kingdom even publicly announced that it had abandoned him and would never look for him, whether alive or dead. The fundamental reason was that he was unwilling to bow to the newborn Son of God and unwilling to let go of the matter of his mother... Such a temperament can be called stupid, or it can be praised as being willing to break but not bend. But in terms of the result, it is obviously more inclined to the former.
Pan Buwang smiled: "I am just an abandoned person now, far from being qualified to be on equal footing with the Star God Son. The Star God Son is willing to meet, Buwang is very grateful."

"Brother Buwang, that's not right."

Shaxing shook his head and said: "I have also personally experienced the pain and helplessness of life's ups and downs. This is not your wish, nor your fault. No one should look down on you for this, especially you."

Pan Buwang was touched and said gratefully: "I am so lucky to be able to make friends with the Star God Son in this life."

After experiencing the Abyss Eclipse, Shaxing's state of mind obviously changed subtly. He said directly: "Brother Buwang, you must have something important to come here this time, just speak frankly."
"Okay, then I won't be polite anymore."

Pan Buwang said: "I hope to go to the Pure Land with the Star-Moon Divine Kingdom to meet the Abyss Emperor."

Sha Xing was surprised, then frowned and shook his head: "Sorry, I can't help you with this matter. Brother Buwang, I believe you should know that the significance of this trip to the Pure Land is far greater than any previous one. And the audience of each Divine Kingdom can only be a hundred people at most."

"In order to compete for the position of a mere hundred people, the major Star Palaces and Moon Cities have organized several large-scale competitions. If you are brought along, it will be unfair to the Star-Moon disciples who are fighting for it, and the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom will also look askance at this matter, If you make unpredictable fantasies and cause a rift between the two countries... even if it is just a slight rift, it is a sin. "

Shaxing's words were all well-founded. Pan Buwang nodded slowly, without any disappointment on his face, as if he had never held out hope from the beginning: "Xingshenzi is right. I was too shallow to think and made such an out-of-bounds request."

"I'm really sorry that I couldn't help you."

Shaxing apologized again: "If Brother Buwang insists on entering the Pure Land, you can find another way. Or..."

He glanced at Pan Buwang and said: "Excuse me, your thoughts don't seem to be that strong. "

Pan Buwang laughed at himself: "Star God Son has a keen eye. Now that things have come to this, I have nothing to hide. This trip to the Pure Land is not my wish, but to obey the will of the Mist Emperor."

Sha Xing froze for a moment, and then said in a completely unquestionable tone: "You said... Mist Emperor?"

"Yes."

Pan Buwang said frankly: "Three years ago, I was desperate and thought about giving up my heart and hiding from the world, and sleeping in the Dream Valley. But the Dream Weaving Kingdom may have taken my identity into consideration. After I fell asleep, they did not put me in the dream, but sent me out in the Xuanzhou. When I woke up, , I was already in the sea of ​​fog. ”
He said with emotion: “To be honest with Star God, I was able to get rid of my heart and live again in the world, all thanks to the Mist Emperor. I have been hiding in the sea of ​​fog for the past three years to repay the Mist Emperor’s kindness.”
“To truly get rid of the abyss of the heart, you must face it directly. I want to go to the Pure Land this time because of what the Mist Emperor said.”
He took a step back: “I will not bother Star God anymore, and I will say goodbye.”
When he turned around, he suddenly remembered the voice of Shaxing, which was obviously a little colder: “Wait!”
Pan Buwang stopped the steps that he had not really taken.
Shaxing’s face sank: “You must know the opposition between the Mist Emperor and the Pure Land, but you mentioned the ‘Mist Emperor’ so wantonly in front of me. It seems that you know that I have received the favor of the Mist Emperor.”
Pan Buwang’s expression was subtle, and he did not say whether it was right or wrong. And silence was already an answer.
“Are you threatening me?”
Shaxing’s voice suddenly became cold. "No,"

Pan Buwang smiled: "It may cause trouble to you to reveal that you have received the favor of the Mist Emperor, but it is of no benefit to me. I am helping you to repay the Mist Emperor's kindness."

"I believe that as proud as you are, the word 'owe' will always be a thorn in your heart, not to mention such a person, and such a great favor." Shaxing's face was cold and silent, and he did not speak for a long time.

Pan Buwang's expression did not change, and his voice was still faint: "Of course, the decision of this matter is up to the Star God. Although I am no longer the Owl Butterfly God, I still can't do anything to harm my old friend, so the Star God can rest assured."

Shaxing stared straight at Pan Buwang, and suddenly said: "You have changed."

Pan Buwang returned the same look: "Everyone will change. If you don't change, it can only be because you don't need to change."

Shaxing's lips trembled, and then he laughed: "I suddenly want to know, you are a person who has been abandoned without any room for mercy, what do you want to do in the Pure Land? Cry to the Abyss Emperor about your experience Unfair? ? Trying to prove your father's mistake in the Pure Land? Or simply to make your father unhappy? "

Pan Buwang: "So..."

"So, I promise to take you to the Pure Land."

Sha Xing said slowly. As one of the sons of the Star and Moon God, he certainly has the qualifications: "You said something very right. What I hate most is owing favors to others!"

"But..."

"No need to remind me."

Pan Buwang had already said before him: "We have never seen the Mist Emperor, let alone any relationship."

He raised his eyes and looked in the direction of the Pure Land. The dark blood in his body was churning wildly, but there was no dark breath leaking out. ... In the depths of the sea of ​​fog, Yun Che slowly stood up. When he opened his eyes, a terrifying light shone in his eyes.

He had been in a state of meditation for the past few days, not for the purpose of achieving a breakthrough, but for the opposite purpose. He suppressed the restless and breaking Xuan Qi again, and this time he suppressed it with great ruthlessness. If it were someone else, suppressing it to this extent would probably seriously damage the Xuan Veins. By now, Li Suo was too lazy to ask him why he had been so determined to suppress his realm. In the three years in the Dreamweaver Divine Kingdom, Yun Che grew from the third level of the Divine Lord Realm to the fourth level of the Divine Lord Realm, with only one small realm improvement.

With a perfect godhood and the accumulation of top resources in the Dreamweaver Divine Kingdom, "Dream of the Abyss"

This progress, in the eyes of the world, is considered a "son of God", but it is far less than the perfect godhood of the Zhetian Goddess Hua Caili. However, it is still within a reasonable range. However, only Li Suo knew that he was Yun Che, an outsider who could not be judged by common sense.

"Finally, I will meet that person." Yun Che whispered to himself.
Li Suo said: "Ni Xuan once specifically reminded you not to get close to him too early, he will easily recognize the evil god inheritance in you."

"I haven't forgotten."

Yun Che responded, and then said something strange: "He is the most powerful existence in the world. If he wants to destroy me now, maybe he only needs to snap his fingers."

"But, in a way, he may be... the easiest person to deal with."

"..."

Li Suo couldn't understand.

"This meeting with him will determine when I will detonate the storm of the abyss."

Yun Che exhaled lightly: "I hope everything goes well."

I hope that everything about the Abyss Emperor will not be too far away from my own guesses and expectations...especially his personality and his obsession. I hope that the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom, which has never been contacted and has no chance to plant "seeds", will always be dead water as rumored, without any waves. I hope...
