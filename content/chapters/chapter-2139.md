"Forgive my offense!"¹ Dian Jiu Zhi² spoke no further. Silver profound light³ covered his arms, and gradually, even his eyes were veiled with a faint silver glow. Though the profound light of Sen Luo⁴ and Zhi Meng⁵ were both silver, their natures were vastly different. Zhi Meng's profound light invaded the soul and disturbed the mind, while Sen Luo's... beneath the Pure Land⁶, it represented the ultimate in overbearing and fierce profound power⁷ of this era.

He had yet to make a move, but an invisible pressure already almost completely sealed the battlefield, leaving no trace of air current. As the Eternal Night Divine Maiden⁸, Dian Jiu Zhi could understand Shen Wu Yi's⁹ coldness, but he could not comprehend her unwavering tranquility even at this moment. He raised his palm, intending to shatter the space where Shen Wu Yi stood from a distance... But just before he struck, his vision suddenly blurred strangely. Everything around him became indistinct, as if silently sealed by an invisible force. All he could see were Shen Wu Yi's eyes, miles away yet seemingly close at hand. Her gaze, from beginning to end, was as cold and still as the dark night, showing not the slightest change. But at this moment, looking directly into those eyes, he inexplicably felt his soul being pierced... That icy, placid gaze was so pure and flawless, like the most perfect and translucent lapis lazuli¹⁰ in the world, untouched by even a speck of worldly dust.

Such pure and untainted eyes seemed to penetrate his own, reflecting into his Soul Sea¹¹, reaching every Soul String¹², every corner. They illuminated every hidden darkness, impurity, and even the most unwilling-to-be-touched scars within his soul, revealing them in minute detail. Gradually, an indescribable feeling of shame and inferiority began to well up within him... as if, under that utterly pure and flawless gaze, his very existence appeared so defiled and unbearable. Dian Jiu Zhi instantly became alert, sharply averting his gaze. However, that eerie sensation of his soul being completely seen through still lingered. Was this... a soul attack? No! Not at all! His soul showed no signs of being invaded... and that feeling of self-abasement¹³ clearly originated naturally from the depths of his soul!? Dian Jiu Zhi's sudden hesitation and the subtle change in his eyes made Dian Luo Hou¹⁴ frown slightly, and everyone else also looked puzzled.

"What's going on?"
Meng Jian Xi¹⁵ whispered, "Dian Jiu Zhi seems a bit distracted?"
"..."
Yun Che¹⁶ stared intently, unblinkingly at Shen Wu Yi, unwilling to be distracted for even a moment. At this point, Shen Wu Yi moved. Her right hand, holding the sword, naturally dropped, and her left hand slowly rose. With a flash of white light, a two-chi¹⁷ long spike appeared. The spike was entirely crystalline white, radiating a divine glow like moonlight. The occasional strange glint from its tip was so chilling that one dared not look directly at it.

"It's that 'Profound Sky Bathed Moon'¹⁸."
Meng Jian Xi said, "Oh, no, it's called 'Heart Severing Spike'¹⁹ now. Her posture... could it be that she intends to use it as a weapon?"

The Heart Severing Spike was a Divine Child's artifact²⁰ imbued with spatial power, primarily used for traversing and escaping. It was an escape and life-saving artifact given to Eternal Night Divine Inheritors²¹, and there was no reason for it to appear on the Pure Land battlefield, where there was no crisis to speak of. Moreover, spatial laws²² are a higher law, transcending water, fire, wind, thunder, earth, light, and darkness, making them extremely difficult to cultivate and even harder to master. When unleashed, they are slow to activate and consume immense energy, making them almost impossible to apply in combat. Escaping in times of crisis relies more on profound artifacts²³ that inherently possess deep spatial divine power and can be rapidly activated.

In the World of the Abyss²⁴, due to its power level being far superior to the God Realm²⁵, the toughness of space is also a dimension higher, making it even harder to traverse and tear. Therefore, the appearance of this spatial artifact from the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom²⁶ on the Divine Child's Battle²⁷ battlefield seemed particularly inexplicable. Yun Che's brows furrowed slightly at this moment... He saw the space around Shen Wu Yi seemingly blurring, then seven... colorless luminous mists²⁸ appeared?

"What... is that?" Meng Jian Xi questioned aloud. The luminous mists flickered in and out of existence, seemingly present yet absent, without any perceptible aura. If not for the noticeable distortion of vision when looking at them, their presence would be completely undetectable. Confusion appeared on everyone's faces... including the various Divine Venerables²⁹.

Until a certain moment, Hua Fu Chen's³⁰ face suddenly showed an expression of disbelief, and he murmured with clear astonishment, "Could it be... the Exquisite Profound Realm³¹!?"

As soon as the four words "Exquisite Profound Realm" were uttered, the faces of the powerhouses from the various Divine Kingdoms³² all changed dramatically. Even the ancient eyes that had witnessed countless vicissitudes of life suddenly opened to their widest. The surroundings also erupted into a near-chaotic clamor.

"Exquisite Profound Realm? This... how is this possible??" Meng Jian Xi muttered in shock.
Meng Kong Chan's³³ gaze sharpened, and he spoke softly, "It is indeed unbelievable, but this spatial anomaly... is exactly as described in ancient texts."

"But isn't that a legendary spatial divine body³⁴ that only awakens in the bodies of ancient True Gods³⁵? Shen Wu Yi... she's just..." Meng Jian Xi's voice began to stammer. Even he couldn't believe that one day he would doubt his Father God's words.

"What is the 'Exquisite Profound Realm'?" Yun Che asked, bewildered.
Meng Jian Xi shook his head, then let out a deep breath to calm himself from the shock. "Younger Brother Yuan³⁶, nineteen months ago, you asked me if anyone in this era possessed the Nine Profound Exquisite Body³⁷. According to records, the 'Exquisite Profound Realm' is a special space that can only be created by those who possess the Nine Profound Exquisite Body."

Yun Che: "..."
"However..."
Meng Jian Xi's tone shifted, "According to records, even if many Nine Profound Exquisite Bodies appeared in this era, it would be absolutely impossible for the 'Exquisite Profound Realm' to manifest. If what Shen Wu Yi possesses is truly the Exquisite Profound Realm, then... there must be a monumental error in the records."
"As for what makes the 'Exquisite Profound Realm' so extraordinary."
Meng Jian Xi shook his head, "I've only seen its name in records; I know nothing else."

At this moment, Meng Kong Chan slowly said, "Little Yuan³⁸, Jian Xi, in common understanding, the special quality of the Nine Profound Exquisite Body is that after awakening and growth, it can form a space within the Profound Veins³⁹, accelerating cultivation speed and making breakthroughs easier."

"Similarly, Dian Jiu Zhi's Profound Veins are called the 'Great Desolate Divine Veins'⁴⁰. But why is the Nine Profound Exquisite Body named after a 'Body' [体], and not 'Nine Profound Exquisite Veins' [九玄玲珑脉]?" Meng Jian Xi didn't know, and neither did Yun Che.

The "Nine Profound Exquisite Body" was a widely known concept, which Yun Che had learned about as early as when he was in the lower realms. However, his understanding of it was also "Profound Veins forming their own world," and... that women with the Nine Profound Exquisite Body were excellent, even the best, cultivation cauldrons⁴¹. As for why it sounded like a unique set of veins but was named "Exquisite Body"... Yun Che had never considered it.

Meng Kong Chan gazed at the luminous mists around Shen Wu Yi and explained softly, "According to records, the Nine Profound Exquisite originates from the Profound Veins. When it germinates, it causes profound energy⁷ to carry a special aura, making it easy to identify. This also leads to two common fates for women with this quality: either they come from an extremely high background, untouchable by others, and upon the full development of their Exquisite Body, they are destined to become a hegemon; or they come from a slightly lower background, chosen as... or forced to be cultivation cauldrons, meeting a tragic end."

"When the Exquisite Body fully develops, the Profound Veins form an inner Exquisite World. Not only does cultivation become extremely fast, but it can also, to a certain extent, transcend laws, with a potential far exceeding ordinary people... However, this is by no means the true form of the Nine Profound Exquisite Body, but merely its sprout... a sprout unable to break through the soil."

"Sprout?"
Yun Che couldn't help but interject, "Even so... it's still just a sprout??"
"Yes, just a sprout, and it can only be a sprout."
Meng Kong Chan said, "Because, generally speaking, a mortal body simply cannot bear the Nine Profound Exquisite... And even among the ancient divine races, those with the Nine Profound Exquisite Body who could perfectly bear the Nine Profound Exquisite and give birth to the 'Exquisite Profound Realm' were one in a hundred!"

Yun Che: "...!"
Exquisite Space... Exquisite Profound Realm... The two characters "Ling Long" (Exquisite) in the Profound Way⁴² directly made one think of space. Yun Che had always thought that the name "Nine Profound Exquisite Body" signified the exquisite world within the Profound Veins... Only now did he realize that it was a spatial divine body that even ancient True Gods could only dream of encountering.

Meng Kong Chan continued, "In the history of the Abyss, although records of those with the Nine Profound Exquisite Body are few, they do occasionally appear. However, there has never been an 'Exquisite Profound Realm'... nor should there have been a manifestation of the 'Exquisite Profound Realm' in this world, so this concept has long become blurred."

"Since it has never existed, and shouldn't exist, then why do Father God and the seniors conclude that it is the 'Exquisite Profound Realm'?" Meng Jian Xi asked.
Meng Kong Chan slowly replied, "Whenever spatial power is used, it inevitably leaves behind traces of laws and dimensional remnants. There are only two exceptions."
"One is the ancient supreme treasure, the Heaven and Earth Spike⁴³, which leaves no trace even when traversing myriad worlds; the other is the 'Exquisite Profound Realm', whose existence can be hidden or revealed, without a sound or trace."

"Shen Wu Yi..."
He softly uttered the name of the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom's junior, his gaze having undergone a tremendous change: "Those seven deliberately revealed spatial ripples, yet even I cannot perceive any spatial laws from them."
"Moreover, she not only bears the Nine Profound Exquisite, which should only appear in a True God's body, with her Divine Extinction Realm⁴⁴ Level Six body, but she has also integrated it to the Seven Profound Realm⁴⁵... a full seven 'Exquisite Profound Realms'."

"This is not far from the perfect Nine Profound⁴⁶, which has only appeared eight times in the vast history of the divine races according to ancient records."
"As for the power of the 'Exquisite Profound Realm', you will soon witness it with your own eyes."

He stared at the battlefield... not just him, but the gazes of the Divine Venerables from various kingdoms were also focused on the Divine Child's Battle battlefield like never before. The unusual sounds outside the barrier made Dian Jiu Zhi suspicious. He looked at the luminous mists around Shen Wu Yi... they were clearly spatial ripples, yet strangely, there was no aura of space being disturbed. As he pondered in surprise, the luminous mists around Shen Wu Yi suddenly vanished, and a sword gleam shone in his pupils.

Chii! The sharp sword tore through the air, incredibly piercing. But just like before, such power posed no threat to him, whose body was formidable and whose cultivation realm⁴⁷ was two full levels higher than Shen Wu Yi's. Facing the sword gleam, he reached out with a grab, this time not merely defending, but unleashing a destructive force with no mercy, intending to shatter Shen Wu Yi with a single blow. Where his five fingers reached, space rapidly twisted and deformed... The terrifying spatial traces and aura made those seven luminous mists appear like illusory profound shadows. Dian Luo Hou instinctively took a step forward, about to warn Dian Jiu Zhi to be careful of the "Exquisite Profound Realm," but the words caught in his throat, and he swallowed them back. Even if it truly was the "Exquisite Profound Realm," and even if the "Exquisite Profound Realm" was as mysterious as the legends claimed, what of it? There was a difference of two full cultivation realms between them, an insurmountable gap. If he were to offer a warning, it would only make him seem inferior.

Bang! Boom! The fierce power of the Sen Luo Myriad Manifestations Art⁴⁸ erupted, and an extremely terrifying distortion appeared in front of him in an instant.

Shen Wu Yi's sword shadow and figure instantly shattered like fragile withered leaves... scattering into countless afterimages.
"...!?" Dian Jiu Zhi was momentarily stunned, then a sudden chill ran through his heart. For a cold glint was pressing directly towards his head. His consciousness only had time to tell him that this was absolutely not an instantaneous movement⁴⁹... because there were no traces of a figure or aura flashing past, and the speed at which the cold glint approached was not even slightly slower than before.
It was as if... a sudden spatial shift occurred during her attack!? Clang!
A metallic clang, and the Heartless Sword⁵⁰ directly struck the crown of Dian Jiu Zhi's head⁵¹, scattering a cluster of broken hair. His cultivation and body were too formidable; even a direct stab to the crown of his head could not completely penetrate his protective profound energy. But that momentary lapse and stinging pain were enough to greatly shock Dian Jiu Zhi.
