Sha Xig didn’t know when, but he found himself standing before the Star and Moon Thousand Opportunities Tower.

He looked up and stared at the mingling, glittering light of the stars and moon. He recalled he and Xian Yue climbing the tower together and exchanging hearty laughter with each other for every floor they climbed.

Now, all the memory brought was infinite sorrow.

A long, long, long silence later, he finally jolted back to reality and prepared to leave. It was at this moment a pair of Star God disciples exited the tower, arm in arm. They were covered in sweat and wounds, but their excited expressions made it clear that they had achieved a breakthrough.

“You know, I heard that the tower guard disciples saying that the Moon Divine Son singlehandedly reached the fiftieth floor after his breakthrough.”

“As expected of the Moon Divine Son. It’s a shame... a shame that the Star Divine Son has not set foot in the Thousand Opportunities Tower since half a year ago. Say, junior brother, do you think that the Star Divine Son is really... half-crippled?”

“That would be an exaggeration, but the abyssal corruption has reached into his profound veins. Unless that portion of his profound veins was completely removed, not even the supreme Abyssal Monarch could do anything about it. Unfortunately, the Star Divine Son refused to give up and kept searching for a way to expel the abyssal corruption perfectly... sigh...”

“To be honest, I heard from my senior brothers on the Moon God’s side that the Moon Divine Son’s pain was no worse than the Star Divine Son’s. In fact, the Moon Divine Son could have achieved a breakthrough three months ago, but he kept it suppressed for fear of agitating the Star Divine Son. It wasn’t until his profound energy was dangerously close to going out of control that he finally made his breakthrough.”

The cool-eyed Sha Xing slowly clenched his fists when he heard this.

“The Star Divine Son and Moon Divine Son have grown up and even become Divine Sons together. They may not be blood-related, but their relationship is beyond anything we outsiders can imagine. In any case, it’s looking more and more like the Star Divine Son will submit to fate and remove a portion of his profound veins, and the Moon Divine Son will slow down his own progress for him...”

“That wouldn’t be so bad, but if the Star Divine Son were to become the Divine Regent in the future... doesn’t that mean we would have a semi-crippled Divine Regent?”

“Besides, the inheritance of the Star and Moon divine power must be carried at the same time, and the two Godbearers must achieve a sufficient level of compatibility. Even if the semi-crippled Star Divine Son shares the same cultivation level as the Moon Divine Son... can you really call it perfect compatibility anymore?”

The worry-filled discussion was, in fact, a reflection of what many people in the Star and Moon Kingdom of God shared were thinking.

“Speaking of which,” the speaker suddenly lowered his voice and scanned his surroundings warily, “I heard from my uncle that a baby boy with eighty percent divine essence was just born in the Star God Clan to the north six days ago.”

“What? Wait, if that is true, then why’s there no news about it?”

“Because the Heavenly Star Divine Regent commanded that the birth was to remain a secret. The only reason I know is because my uncle happened to be present when the Star God child was born.”

“If the Heavenly Star Divine Regent himself gave such an order, does that mean... he has personally paid the newborn a visit?”

“That’s why my uncle said that the Star God Clan may be experiencing an upheaval very soon, and that I should watch out for any movement. You are the only one who heard of this from me, understand? So you better—”

Suddenly, the speaker’s voice trailed off. It was because he and his companion felt a sudden chill behind their backs. They turned around just in time to see Xian Yue staring at them coldly.

“Moon... Moon Divine Son.” The duo immediately tensed up, hearts beating twice as fast as before.

There was a blur, and Xian Yue was standing right in front of them. His eyes were so cold his gaze felt like moonlight knives that could carve out their hearts. “I’m only going to say this one time. I don’t care if what you said is real or fake, but so long as I, Xian Yue, am still the Moon Divine Son, the Star Divine Son can only be Sha Xing! No one, not even a Star God child with perfect divine essence, will ever make me change my mind!”

“From now on, I will not hear any absurd rumors regarding the Star Divine Son anymore. Otherwise... you don’t want to know how I am when I’m angry!”

“P... please calm down, Moon Divine son. It was just a slip of the tongue, a... careless conversation. We don’t mean any disrespect...”

“Get lost!”

The two disciples immediately shut up. They ran off in panic, afraid to breathe a single word.

Xian Yue stood there for a long time before the ice in his eyes finally faded. He then let out a long sigh.

He was about to turn away when he suddenly sensed something and turned back. There, he met Sha Xing’s eyes.

There was a brief flash of panic in his eyes, but he quickly calmed down and took to the sky. When he landed in front of Sha Xing, he said smilingly, “It’s not really my jurisdiction, but I decided to release those two idiots. It’s because I’m sure you are above their foolish, petty words.”

“Congratulations on your breakthrough.” Sha Xing returned a smile.

Xian Yue’s expression did not change as he said, “I got ahead of you this time, but I’m sure it won’t take long at all for you to achieve your breakthrough once your abyssal corruption is removed.”

Sha Xing looked into his eyes. “Do you think I should give up and just remove the abyssal corruption as well?”

Xian Yue countered, “If I was the one who inspected that abyssal beast’s body half a year ago, then I would be in the exact same situation as you. Would you abandon me if I was the one who had to sever my profound veins permanently to remove the abyssal corruption?”

Sha Xing’s face grew a little stern. He replied without hesitation, “Never.”

“Would you be willing to slow down your footsteps and delay your progress for me, who is now a burden?”

“I would.”

“Would you resent me for it?”

“... I wouldn’t.”

“So...” Xian Yue broke into a sunny, carefree grin. “What are you worried, hesitant, and afraid of? Our compatibility is hardly something shallow like our cultivation, aura, and behavior. It is in our resolve to share fortune and misfortune, glory and humiliation together.”

He grabbed Sha Xing’s wrist and spoke, every word coming from his soul, "This tribulation is just one slightly bigger tribulation in our long journey together. We have been one for over a thousand years. There is no way one small tribulation can defeat us, is there?”

“Besides, I’ve already made up my mind. If the damage to your profound veins truly prevents us from synchronizing as perfectly as we did before, if we are unable to become the Star and Moon twins of old times, then I will sever my own profound veins to achieve perfect compatibility with you once more! I am certain you would do the same thing if you were in my position.”

Xian Yue’s decision to compromise and even sacrifice himself and his constant talk about being in his shoes so as to avoid hurting his pride... Sha Xing would be lying if he said if he wasn’t warmed by it, but this indescribable feeling choking him from the inside out was so, so much worse.

“Hahaha!” Sha Xing barked out a laugh. “Have all our years together been for naught, Xian Yue? I can’t believe you’re looking down on me like this. This level of abyssal corruption would cost me ten percent of my profound veins at most. Do you really think this level of loss can break me?”

He counter-grabbed Xian Yue’s wrist and gave him a strong squeeze. Then, he let go and turned away, saying, “It’s just that people can’t help but dream about fantasies from time to time, believing that they could do what others could not do. I am no exception, so... give me another three months. If I cannot find a way to purify the abyssal corruption during this time, then I will sever it without regrets.”

“Worst case scenario, I’ll let you drag me all the way to the finish line. I won’t feel any regret if it’s you!”

“Okay!” Xian Yue nodded smilingly. “It’s a promise!”

Xian Yue left after that. It wasn’t until he was completely out of sight that Sha Xing’s fearless mask of pride abruptly shattered into a million pieces.

He abruptly turned around, teeth shaking slightly from how hard he was clenching them.

“I can tolerate... being a cripple for the rest of my life. But becoming your burden...? Never... never!”

He lifted his head and looked at a certain direction, never-before-seen determination nestling in his eyes.

It was the direction of the Endless Fog.

He told no one about his intentions. He avoided the surrounding people as best he could and stepped out of the divine region and eventually, the borders.

Outside the borders, Sha Xing said coldly, “I need time alone. Don’t follow me!”

The silhouette who had been protecting him this whole time did not.

He sneered. “What’s wrong? Have I fallen so far that even you won’t listen to me anymore?”

The silhouette shadowing him let out a sigh before withdrawing.

He waited for hours, but Sha Xing did not return.

Hours turned into days, and still Sha Xing did not return.

When he finally set his mind to search for Sha Xing, he discovered that he was too late. Not a speck of Sha Xing’s aura could be found anywhere.

The scent of death was everywhere inside the grayish Endless Fog.

This was the first time Sha Xing entered the Endless Fog alone. It was also the first time he rebelled against the orthodoxy.

All... for that sliver of hope.

He avoided the profound practitioners and the abyssal beasts. Finally, he arrived at the nightmarish place that had damned him half a year ago.

Even as the trauma struck him like a physical object, Sha Xing gritted his teeth and pushed forward. As the density of the abyssal dust grew, the number of profound practitioners he could sense kept decreasing as well. It would continue until he could no longer sense anyone.

Finally, he stopped in his tracks, sucked in a deep breath, and let out a somewhat trembling roar, “Star and Moon Divine Son Sha Xing requests an audience with the Fog Monarch!”

He knew that countless people corrupted by abyssal corruption came to the Endless Fog praying for a miracle from the Fog Monarch everyday. He also knew how hopeless their pleas were. However, they also claimed that the Fog Monarch was omnipresent inside the Endless Fog, and every speck of abyssal dust was his eyes and ears, so he shouted his title. He hoped that the Fog Monarch was truly omnipresent, and that his title was special enough to draw the Fog Monarch’s attention, any attention at all.

Unfortunately, his shout did not summon the Fog Monarch. Instead, it summoned a massive wave of abyssal beasts.

Continuous howls erupted from deeper within the abyssal fog. Frowning, Sha Xing summoned his heavy sword and circulated his Star God power throughout his body.

When the abyssal beasts’ terrifying aura hit him though, the solemn determination in his eyes instantly morphed into terror.

It was because he had drawn not one, not two, but three level five Divine Extinction Realm abyssal beasts!

The Heavenly Wolf howled angrily as he swung his heavy sword, but his movements also awakened the abyssal corruption trapped inside his profound veins. It stabbed at his nerves like swords and impeded the flow of his profound energy, causing the momentum of his sword to become distorted. He was already at an absolute disadvantage in the first place, and this made things so much worse.

His heavy sword was knocked aside before the abyssal beast’s teeth could even reach him. Pitch black claws ripped apart his Star God power and tore a hole in his chest.

As abyssal power erupted cruelly from his body, Sha Xing executed Star God’s Broken Shadow and just barely dashed away to safety. However, two more abyssal beasts reached him and inflicted four black scars on his person before he could even stand still.

Blood pouring between his teeth, Sha Xing and the silhouette of the Heavenly Wolf let out a furious roar together. He rushed forward with fatal determination and the fifth sword of the Heavenly Wolf, Azure Wolf Claw in his hand.

Unfortunately, his Heavenly Wolf power was ripped apart by even greater abyssal power. He was able to push back the two Divine Extinction Realm abyssal beasts somewhat, but he also earned several more bone deep wounds on his arms and chest.

At this point, he no longer had any strength left to defend against the third abyssal beast. A claw struck his heart, and his heavy sword left his hand. He flew across the ground while spraying blood like a leaking blood bag.

Even if he hadn’t been afflicted with abyssal corruption, even if he was at tiptop condition, he could not have fought even one level five Divine Extinction Realm abyssal beast alone, much less three of them.

He didn’t even hit the ground before he was swept away by an abyssal storm once more. Primal destructive instinct drove the abyssal beasts to attack the Star Divine Son without any reservation whatsoever. Like a withered leaf that had fallen off its branch, the Star Divine Son could do nothing but be ripped apart piece by piece by the cruel storm of destruction. He was covered in wounds and bleeding everywhere in no time.

When he finally hit the ground with a heavy thud and subconsciously tried to stand up, he discovered that his legs were broken and shattered already. Not a moment too soon, an abyssal claw stomped down his upper torso and smashed his head against the ground. His internal organs were crumbling piece by piece under the immense pressure as well.

Sha Xing’s pupils dilated to the max. He refused to give up and die here, but his injuries were so severe that the starlight in his eyes was fading rapidly despite his will. It was slowly but surely turning as gray and dark as the Endless Fog.

I... cannot possibly... die here...

He struggled with all his might, but his consciousness gradually turned white, then into nothingness...

When his consciousness had completely disappeared, the three rampaging abyssal beasts abruptly ceased their attacks and slowly backed away from Sha Xing. They fell into complete and absolute silence.

Inside the darkness, a shadow surrounded by thick abyssal dust leisurely walked out of the abyssal fog and stood in front of Sha Xing.

He raised his hand, and the surrounding abyssal dust quickly converged above his palm until a long, dense line of black was formed.

“Welcome to the Endless Fog, my noble abyssal ghost Divine Son!”

He whispered and injected the black scar mercilessly into Sha Xing’s forehead.
