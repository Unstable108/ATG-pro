Dian Sansi’s hands clenched violently. His emotions, which had just barely calmed, were reignited like a sudden blaze of wrathful fire, surging uncontrollably to the top of his head.

A soft, warm flow of profound energy spread through his body and soul sea, pressing down the storm of hostility that had just erupted.
“I don’t want to see him right now. Help me deal with it,” came a calm voice.

Dian Sansi raised his head. “I…”

“To know self-reflection is only the beginning of growth,” Dian Jiuzhi said evenly. “To truly mature—to stand on your own—you must learn to control your words, your deeds, and your emotions. Your joy and anger should not show on your face; your heart may burn with hellfire, yet your countenance must remain still as a mirror lake. Hate to your very bones if you must—but do so with a smile and steady voice.”

Dian Jiuzhi’s demeanor was composed, his eyes unclouded, like an elder brother patiently teaching a younger one who had not yet come of age.

“I believe you can do it.”

Dian Sansi shook his head, then quickly steadied himself and nodded firmly. “Don’t worry, Brother Jiuzhi. I won’t let you down.”

Yun Che’s arrival instantly drew the attention of all the powerful beings within the Senluo Divine Kingdom.

It was his first time meeting the legendary First Divine Sovereign of the Six Divine Kingdoms. The man’s eyes shone like torches; his beard was that of a lion’s mane. His arms were thick and gleaming like forged steel, and no one would doubt that they contained the power to rend the heavens.

When his gaze fell upon Yun Che, it felt as if a sky-piercing mountain were collapsing down upon him.

Even with mental preparation, Yun Che’s breath still stalled for two fleeting moments.

Glancing at him, Dian Luohu—far from displaying the lofty majesty befitting the First Divine Sovereign—burst into booming laughter as he strode forward himself. “So it’s the young one from Old Meng’s family! I’ve heard your name so often these days, my ears have calluses from it!”

His voice was like thunder, every word shaking the soul.

With every step he took, it felt as if the entire world quivered in rhythm.

Yun Che quickly performed the formal salute of a junior, his tone part modesty and part composure.
“Junior Yun Che greets the Revered Divine Sovereign Luohu. While wandering abroad, I often heard your name resound through the heavens. After returning to the Dreamweaver Divine Kingdom, the God Sovereign Wumeng often spoke of you as well. To finally behold you today is both an honor and a trembling joy.”

“Hmm…” Dian Luohu’s eyes scanned Yun Che several times before he laughed aloud. “Hahaha! So you’re really as Old Meng described—stubborn as a mule! No wonder he always praises you to the skies. Never mind that perfect divine soul of yours—even your looks outshine your useless father by a wide margin back in the day!”

“I still remember when I held you as an infant—you weighed barely eight jin, all wrinkled like a little monkey! Look at you now—you’ve brought no small glory to that old dreamer, hahahaha!”

His laughter thundered, yet there was not a hint of condescension—only the fond appreciation of an elder for the son of a dear friend.

Yun Che smiled. “The Divine Sovereign flatters me. You are indeed as majestic and awe-inspiring as the stories say. Might I ask if the Senluo Divine Son is present? I once had the fortune of conversing with Brother Dian, and we got along most delightfully. Now that I’ve come to the Pure Lands, I couldn’t resist paying my respects.”

Dian Sansi stepped out from the barrier and said aloud, “You’ve come at an unfortunate time, Yun Shenzi. Brother Jiuzhi is currently bathing in the sacred aura of the Pure Lands. He was suddenly struck by inspiration and is now in seclusion within the barrier, comprehending enlightenment. I’ve been standing guard for him.”

“Oh?” Dian Luohu raised his brows, then smiled with satisfaction. “So that’s how it is. Good! Very good!”

“I see,” Yun Che said with a smile. “As expected of Brother Dian—always seizing fortune with ease. Truly admirable.”

Turning toward Dian Sansi, he said thoughtfully, “And this must be Brother Sansi?”

Though they had never met, Dian Sansi was startled to hear Yun Che address him by name. “I am Dian Sansi,” he replied. “But please, ‘Brother Sansi’ is too much. You are the Divine Son of the Dreamweaver Nation—just call me Sansi.”

Yun Che smiled with harmless gentleness. “The Divine Son of Dreamweaver is Meng Jianxi; I’m merely a wanderer returning home—unworthy of such a title. You’re sixty years my senior and famed throughout the realm. To call you ‘Brother’ is only proper.”

“Hahahaha!” Dian Luohu laughed again. “You boy—you’ve got quite the tongue! All that polite formality and rule-following—reminds me of your father back in the day!”

Yun Che gave a friendly nod to Dian Sansi, then saluted Dian Luohu once more. “Though I regret not seeing Brother Dian this time, it is undoubtedly a blessing for him. In that case, I shall not disturb you further. I’ll visit again later to catch up.”

“Hmm. Friendship lies in endurance, not immediacy,” Dian Luohu said, not stopping him. “Sansi, see the Dreamweaver youth off.”

It was clear he intended to help Dian Sansi and Yun Che form a bond.

Whether Yun Che now acknowledged the name Meng Jianyuan or not—whether or not he still bore the title of Dreamweaver Divine Son—mattered little. His perfect divine soul was known and marveled at throughout the world.

Meng Kongchan’s guilt and affection toward Yun Che were equally plain to see.

Unless struck down by misfortune, the future Dreamweaver God Sovereign could only be Meng Jianyuan—Yun Che.

Within the barrier, sensing Yun Che’s departure, Dian Jiuzhi—though the one betrayed and hurt—finally let out a long sigh of relief.

With no one around, his exhaustion and pain surfaced fully, his facial muscles twitching uncontrollably.

“A tall phoenix tree will surely draw the phoenix; a fragrant flower will naturally call the butterfly… So you are the blooming flower—and I, alas, am not the tree.”

“The phoenix once shone its colors and lit my dying heart… What is there for me to hate… or resent…”

His hand felt cold. In the haze of grief, he saw a glimmer of moisture slide down.

Crystal-clear though it was, the reflected light pierced the heart like a blade.

Closing his eyes, he murmured softly, “To meet someone willing to give their all for love—is life’s greatest blessing. Very well, Caili… if he is the one your heart has chosen, the one for whom even you—who never cross boundaries—would defy all restraint…”

“I will never stand in your way.”

“I will only help you.”

Dian Sansi escorted Yun Che far from the Pure Lands. Yun Che continued asking about various well-known matters of the Senluo Divine Kingdom, never letting him turn back.

Patiently answering, Dian Sansi didn’t realize how far they had walked until they were already beyond sight.

Then Yun Che suddenly shifted his tone, catching him off guard.
“Back at the Spirit Immortal Hall—you and Dian Jiuzhi both saw it, didn’t you?”

Dian Sansi froze mid-step.

Staring at the faint, knowing smile on Yun Che’s lips, he began to understand—and his expression darkened. “You… did that on purpose?”

“Of course,” Yun Che said, the curve of his lips widening into open mockery. “If I hadn’t sensed Dian Jiuzhi’s aura approaching, I wouldn’t have been so unrestrained in the Pure Lands.”

“You…!!”

All the calm that Dian Sansi had forced himself to maintain cracked apart.

Never had he imagined that Yun Che—though not the Dreamweaver Divine Son—would reveal such a face, so suddenly, so brazenly!

He forced down his fury and let out a cold laugh. “Are you trying to provoke my Brother Jiuzhi—to provoke the entire Senluo Divine Kingdom!?”

“Oh no, no,” Yun Che said lightly, his tone falsely humble but his smile vicious. “I wouldn’t dare provoke something as grand as the Senluo Divine Kingdom. I just…”—his voice turned sharp—“…look down on Dian Jiuzhi.”

“After all, this so-called ‘Number One Divine Son of the Six Nations’ is, in truth, nothing but a pitiful coward!”

Boom!

Dian Sansi’s aura flared out of control, the surrounding air exploding in deafening bursts.

A deep fury—tinged faintly with killing intent—seeped from his chaotic breath.

“Oh?” Yun Che folded his arms, watching him with interest. “Brother Sansi, are you angry? Did I say something wrong?”

“At the Spirit Immortal Hall, Dian Jiuzhi must have been a thousand times angrier than you are now. Any ordinary man—anyone with a shred of pride or blood—would have stood up and faced it head-on.”

“But alas… or rather, fittingly for the Senluo Divine Son, even when his spirit was crushed, when his honor was torn to pieces, he still chose to shrink his head back into his shell—and drag you with him in cowardly retreat.”

“What’s even funnier—at least a mangy dog knows how to bark when it’s humiliated. But your noble ‘Number One Divine Son’—he didn’t even dare make a sound as he fled. Tsk, tsk, tsk… hahahahaha!”

Crack! Crack! Crack!

Yun Che’s laughter mingled with the grinding of teeth and snapping joints from Dian Sansi.

It took every ounce of willpower for Dian Sansi to suppress the urge to strike. His fair face darkened, turning blood-red.

“Hm? What’s that sound?” Yun Che asked lazily. “Is Brother Sansi angry enough to avenge your Brother Jiuzhi on me?”

“I hear you’ve already reached the third level of the God Extinction Realm at just sixty years of age—unmatched among your peers in Senluo. I, on the other hand, am only a mere God Lord. Surely one blow of your righteous fury would reduce me to dust. How terrifying.”

Despite his words, his eyes gleamed with mockery—without a trace of fear.

Dian Jiuzhi’s warnings and his own promise echoed in his ears, carving out a sliver of reason amid the rage.

Slowly, the fury subsided instead of flaring, and Dian Sansi managed a cold, stiff smile.

He was just about to retort when Yun Che suddenly put on a look of exaggerated realization.

“Ohhh~~ I see. You don’t dare. Your Brother Jiuzhi must have ordered you again and again to stay silent, to pretend ignorance—all for the sake of the ‘nation’s dignity,’ the ‘divine son’s face,’ to wait until you’ve left the Pure Lands before acting, am I right?”

The words struck like a hammer to the chest. Dian Sansi’s face, which had barely regained its color, turned a ghastly blue-purple.

Yun Che smiled serenely. “Your face just turned ugly. Looks like I hit the mark. Then again, it’s no surprise—cowards are experts at weaving excuses.”

“Yun… Che!” Dian Sansi’s eyes gleamed with killing intent. “Even if you are the Dreamweaver Divine Son—dare to insult my Brother Jiuzhi and my Senluo Divine Kingdom, and you will pay a price you’ll regret for the rest of your life!”

“Oh, that’s simple,” Yun Che said lazily. “You could tell your father god what happened today—Divine Sovereign Luohu’s wrath would surely burn me to ash. Or…”

He lifted a finger and tapped it lightly against his own temple. “You could just smash my skull right here.”

“True, striking within the Pure Lands carries a heavy cost—one that not even your title could escape. But as men, our pride and blood should come before all else, don’t you think, Brother Sansi?”

He stepped closer—two deliberate paces—into the seething heat of Dian Sansi’s fury, still wearing that calm, smiling face.

Dian Sansi’s fists tightened until blood oozed between his fingers. “You’re… deliberately goading me!!”

“Yes,” Yun Che admitted cheerfully. “Because I want to see, with my own eyes, just how worthless the two most ‘brilliant’ men of the Senluo Divine Kingdom can be.”

“As it turns out, you’re no different from that pathetic Senluo Divine Son—both of you are nothing but pure, spineless trash!”

His words dripped with mockery and venom, the derision on his face stretched to its fullest.

With a faint, cold laugh, Yun Che turned leisurely around. Amid Dian Sansi’s glare—so fierce it seemed ready to strip his bones bare—he walked away at an unhurried, almost casual pace.

“Such filth dares to covet my Caili? What a cosmic joke. Go back and tell Dian Jiuzhi this—” his voice grew low and sharp, “a toad belongs in the mud. No matter how high it jumps, it will never change its filthy, pitiful nature.”

Crack!

A few beads of blood spattered from between Dian Sansi’s clenched teeth.

But even then, he endured—refusing to strike—until Yun Che’s figure vanished completely from his crimson-blurred vision.

Only when Dian Sansi’s perception could no longer reach him did Yun Che’s mocking expression fade, replaced by utter calm.

“You provoked him that far,” Li Sou said quietly, her tone edged with concern. “Aren’t you afraid he might lose control and strike in a rage?”

Yun Che replied evenly, “Don’t worry. I know my limits.”

Sensing fluctuations of emotion—even the subtlest changes of mood—was the Demon Queen’s greatest specialty. Among such skills, judging whether someone’s anger was on the brink of total loss of control was the simplest of all.

Li Sou asked, “So you’re certain no one would dare make a move within the Pure Lands?”

“No.” Yun Che shook his head. “That’s only the smallest reason. What I truly exploited… was Dian Jiuzhi’s infatuation with Hua Caili.”

In this world, few things are rarer—or more precious—than true devotion.

And nothing is easier to exploit than devotion.

Therefore, the most despicable sin of all… is to use that devotion.

Those words existed clearly in the awareness of the Demon Queen, Chi Wuyao.

Li Sou couldn’t comprehend. “How can you be so sure that Dian Jiuzhi’s love for Hua Caili could drive him to such extremes?”

Yun Che did not pretend to be mysterious; he answered plainly, “Before, I only heard of his obsession with Caili. But when I met him in the Dreamweaver Divine Kingdom, everything about him radiated the brilliance befitting the First Divine Son. Yet when he suddenly asked how he might win the favor and affection of the one he desired most, beneath that shining aura… I saw a self-contempt and inferiority so deep it reached the bone.”

As he spoke, not a trace of ridicule appeared in Yun Che’s eyes—only a faint, concealed darkness.

His explanation only left Li Sou more puzzled. But she didn’t press further, for she knew her own understanding of love between man and woman was too faint—
a faintness carved into her by Yun Che himself.

Yun Che raised his hand, fingers curling as if grasping something unseen. “Right now, Dian Sansi has been pushed to his limit. The rage and humiliation burning within him—forced to be repressed instead of released—won’t fade anytime soon.”

“When the time comes, when I decide the moment is right, just one small prick will be enough to make him—”

Bang!

Yun Che’s fingers opened, the motion bursting with a faint crack of air. A chilling smile crept across his face.

Li Sou watched him silently for a long moment before murmuring, “Your expression… is a little frightening.”

“Mm.” Yun Che admitted it without hesitation. “The face of a proper demon, isn’t it?”

“Perhaps,” Li Sou replied softly. After a pause, she added, “Still, you must be as careful as possible. This is, after all, the highest realm of the Abyss. Even the smallest misstep could mean eternal ruin.”

Ever since stepping into the Pure Lands, Li Sou’s few words had been constant—repeated warnings, reminders to be cautious, again and again.

Perhaps her faint trace of Creation God soul had brushed against something within this Pure Land that filled her with unease.

“Mm. You can rest easy,” Yun Che reassured her again. “For me, the Pure Lands are ironically the safest place in the entire Abyss.”

Yun Che’s pace was unhurried. Whether he slowed deliberately or was simply lost in thought, even he did not seem to know.

Then, out of nowhere, he spoke—a question that Li Sou could never hope to answer:

“Tell me… one who uses another’s true heart, regardless of the reason—can such a person ever be forgiven?”

As expected, Li Sou stayed silent for a long time.

She could not answer.

But she felt it clearly—when Yun Che uttered that question so casually, his soul twitched in pain.

It was fleeting, almost imperceptible—erased by him the instant it appeared.
Yet it made Li Sou’s spirit ache with a strange, unfamiliar stab—
a pain that pierced straight through her divine soul.

As though somewhere deep within, something had silently… cracked.

Yun Che kept walking. Receiving no answer, he said nothing more for a long while.

Then suddenly, Li Sou sensed his spirit tighten to an extreme—taut and motionless for several breaths.

He did not stop walking, but his steps grew light, his released aura fading thin—as if deliberately minimizing his presence.

The Pure Lands were serene and silent, amplifying the sound of his heartbeat.

Ahead, a tall figure appeared, slowly approaching.

The figure stood nearly a zhang high, yet the might he carried was immeasurable—greater than mountains, crushing all beneath its weight.

That oppressive power… surpassed even that of the Divine Sovereign Luohu!

The Sovereign’s body was like forged steel, yet this man’s exposed flesh gleamed with an ancient bronze hue, as if tempered through endless eons. From him radiated the supreme divine pressure of something ancient—transcending all beings.

Yun Che shifted his path, choosing to avoid direct encounter.

But the figure suddenly stopped.

A terrifying gaze locked onto him—instantly.

With it came a force so dreadful it nearly shattered his bones and soul in that instant.

Seeing there was no longer any way to avoid it, Yun Che turned slightly and bowed deeply toward the approaching presence.
“Yun Che of the Dreamweaver Divine Kingdom pays respect to the Grand Priest.”

Such an appearance, such an aura—there could be only one possibility.

The foremost among the Four Priests of the Pure Lands—
the Grand Priest, second only to the Abyssal Monarch himself, sovereign above all living beings.

He was also the only person within the Pure Lands whom Hua Caili truly feared.

Yun Che’s self-identification did not make the gaze waver in the slightest.
That stare was terrifying—piercing through his flesh and bone, as though dissecting his very essence.

Then a voice struck out—each word a divine hammer to the soul:

“Your Power of the Pagoda—where did it come from!?”

“—!”

Yun Che’s brow twitched sharply.
