Yun Che's words left everyone dumbfounded, stunned into a long silence. To Meng Kongchan's ears, they were nothing short of earth-shattering. This was a response no one could have possibly anticipated.

Even the Divine Attendant Su Shang, who was as elegant as a cloud and always unruffled, and the Divine Attendant Yuan Ying, who was as carefree as the wind and let nothing bother him, showed clear astonishment. The color drained from Hua Caili's jade-like face at a speed visible to the naked eye. She seized Yun Che's hand and cried out in panic, "Brother Yun, what are you saying... No! No! Absolutely not! Whether it's punishment or pardon, I'll face it with you. Don't even think about casting me aside!"

Her every jade-like finger was locked tightly with his, terrified that he would let her go again.

"Yuan'er, you... take back those words at once!"

Meng Kongchan roared in alarm, "You cannot speak such nonsense!"

He had never imagined that Yun Che would turn a blessing from the heavens into a double torture for himself... transforming a chance at life into an even deeper abyss of despair.

At this moment, Meng Jianxi could no longer hold back. He took several steps forward and screamed with all his might, "Brother Yuan! While the Wilderness Devouring Punishment is not a death sentence, its horror far exceeds your imagination! The punishment penetrates the blood, the flesh, the tendons, the bones, the marrow, the very soul... Every last fiber of your body will suffer an agony millions of times more terrifying than ten thousand nightmares. There is no defense against it, only the wish for death!"

"According to the records of the Revolving Jade Hall, a total of one hundred and seventy-six people have undergone the Wilderness Devouring Punishment... yet only nine survived to its completion."

"The rest were unable to bear it and took their own lives during the ordeal!"

"And of the nine who endured the full punishment, six were in the late-stage Divine Extinction Realm, and three were in the Divine Sovereign Realm. This is simply not a torture you can withstand! A double Wilderness Devouring Punishment... is utterly impossible! Absolutely not!"

"Take back what you just said! You must take it back, no matter what! Do not, under any circumstances, try to be a hero!"

"Even if it's for Father God, for the Dreamweaving Divine Kingdom!!"

By the end, every word of Meng Jianxi's roar was tragic and intense. In his three years in the Dreamweaving Divine Kingdom, he had never told Yun Che a single thing about the Wilderness Devouring Punishment. He figured Yun Che could only make such a decision because he was completely ignorant of its terror.

"Yun Che," Hua Qingying, who was always cold and taciturn in public, spoke faintly, causing many of her infatuated admirers to quietly turn their ears and eyes. "I know your feelings for Caili, but the horror of the Wilderness Devouring Punishment is beyond your comprehension. Listen to your Father God and retract your words. With two Divine Officers pleading for you, the Abyss Emperor and the Grand Divine Officer will not be overly harsh."

Yun Che's gaze did not waver. It remained fixed on the Abyss Emperor. "My mind is made up. I implore the Abyss Emperor, for the sake of the two senior Divine Officers, to grant my request."

Despite being repeatedly told how terrifying the Wilderness Devouring Punishment was, his response still held not the slightest trace of apprehension or hesitation.

"Yuan'er, you..."

"Brother Yuan!!!"

"..." Hua Qingying's eyes rippled, and for a moment, she was speechless.

"Brother Yun, I won't allow it!" Hua Caili shook her head forcefully, her fingers, already intertwined with his, squeezing so hard they lost all color. In that short time, her initial panic had transformed into profound determination. "I told you, I will never let you endure this alone... Never."

The profound practitioners from other kingdoms wore ever-changing expressions. They could no longer make sense of the situation, much less this junior who had just returned to his divine kingdom. They didn't know whether to mock his ignorance of the Wilderness Devouring Punishment or to praise his fearlessness in taking it on alone.

"Yun Che," Divine Attendant Su Shang spoke, offering a word of caution that was beyond her station. "I advise you against this. The horror of the Wilderness Devouring Punishment is not something an ordinary will can endure. If you do this... I will not be able to answer to my master."

"I concur," Divine Attendant Yuan Ying immediately added. "This act is indeed incredibly bold, enough to surprise even a desireless person like myself, but I truly have no way of explaining this to my master either. You should plead for more mercy. The worst outcome would be both of you receiving half the punishment, and you might both emerge safely."

Yun Che turned his gaze and gave them a grateful smile. "Please forgive this junior for being unable to bow due to my restraints. I must also trouble you both to convey my thanks to the two senior Divine Officers."

Su Shang sighed softly, gave Yun Che a deep look, then bowed slightly to the Abyss Emperor and the Grand Divine Officer before departing into the distance. Yuan Ying let out a long breath and also rode the clouds away.

However, as he left, his voice drifted back, seemingly a murmur, seemingly a sigh, "No wonder little Caili fell so hard for him. Whether this kid is a fool is another matter, but he really has guts¹."

The Abyss Emperor suddenly spoke, his voice faint. "Tell me, why?"

Even the Abyss Emperor, a man of few words, seemed to have grown curious about Yun Che's astonishing response.

Yun Che's posture was unchanged, his every word clear, neither servile nor overbearing. "I have indeed committed a grave error. No amount of hidden reasons or helplessness can excuse it. I deserve this punishment, without regret or complaint."

"Only by enduring this punishment in its entirety can I truly atone for this crime, be worthy of the Abyss Emperor's forgiveness, and satisfy the world... so that Dreamweaving will not be overly shamed because of me."

The people of Dreamweaving were all frozen in place. Even the few Masters of the Dream Halls who had always resented Yun Che for usurping Meng Jianxi's position found their eyes misting over in that instant.

"Yuan'er," Meng Kongchan shook his head gently. "Dreamweaving only owes you a debt... How could there be any shame? Your well-being is the greatest blessing for me, and for Dreamweaving."

Meng Jianxi choked up, only managing to speak with difficulty after a long moment. "Brother Yuan, you truly... don't have to do this..."

The nine Masters of the Dream Halls exchanged glances, endless emotions tangling chaotically in their eyes and hearts.

The Abyss Emperor spoke again. "In that case, you could have asked me to pardon Caili. Why insist on bearing a double punishment alone?"

Yun Che's gaze softened, and his voice grew gentle. "Caili is the most wonderful woman in the world. She erred because of me. Even if I had to endure ten times the Wilderness Devouring Punishment, I would never allow her to suffer the slightest pain, much less the world's censure... I only pray that this double punishment can also atone for Caili's crime."

Hua Fuchen tilted his head back slightly, letting out a slow breath only after a long while.

Hua Caili was still shaking her head. By now, her expression had become unnaturally calm, her gaze growing ever more resolute. "Brother Yun, we have walked the edge of life and death side by side. How could I let you face this alone... Be it the Wilderness Devouring Punishment or anything else, as long as you are here, I will fear nothing."

But the Abyss Emperor's response mercilessly shattered her resolve.

"Good."

The Abyss Emperor averted his gaze. His words were devoid of emotion, containing only the indifferent weight of an imperial command. "Since this is to repay the favor to Ling Xian and Liu Xiao, I shall grant your wish."

Hua Caili's expression instantly turned to horror. "Uncle Abyss Emperor², no..."

The Grand Divine Officer had already received the order. Without any visible movement, a strange light flashed in his eyes. In an instant, the profound light binding Hua Caili shattered, and an irresistible force violently repelled her body. Yet, unexpectedly, it failed to push her far... her fingers remained deathly gripped around Yun Che's, producing a heart-rending sound of breaking bones.

"Uncle Abyss Emperor," she pleaded, her face streaked with tears. "You always doted on me the most... I beg you, let me accompany him... Uncle Abyss Emperor!"

Crack! Crack! All five of her jade-like fingers were twisted out of shape, the sound of breaking bones continuing, yet she stubbornly refused to let go.

The Grand Divine Officer's voice deepened. "If you do not withdraw, your crime will be compounded!"

Hua Qingying's figure flickered, and she appeared beside Hua Caili. Her snow-white hand, like cold jade, reached out and gently clasped their intertwined fingers.

"Caili," her voice was a gentle tone completely unfamiliar to others, one she only ever used with Hua Caili. "The imperial command has been given and cannot be changed. Do not... go against his wishes."

"..." Hua Caili's expression froze. Her pale, jade-like fingers finally lost all strength and were gently separated from Yun Che's by Hua Qingying. A cyan shadow flashed, and the limp body of Hua Caili was brought to Hua Fuchen's side. A gentle profound energy covered her fingers, mending her injuries.

Over with the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom, Pan Buzhuo sneered under his breath, "Tch! Such pretty words! He has no idea how terrifying the Wilderness Devouring Punishment is. He sounds so noble now, but in a moment, his screams will be just as pathetic. He'll be wailing and crying for mercy... Just thinking about it is pathetic."

He had no personal grudge against Yun Che. But... Yun Che's profound talent was world-shocking, he had won the affection of the Heaven-Folding Divine Maiden, and he was even more handsome... How could he not be jealous of such a peer? And now, this person who inspired such immense jealousy was about to suffer the Wilderness Devouring Punishment. The thought of the agony he was about to face and the pathetic state he would be in filled him with an irrepressible, surging delight.

At that moment, the cruel sentence rang out: "Yun Che, receive your punishment!"

The Grand Divine Officer spread his five fingers. A beam of withered-yellow profound light shot from his palm, transforming in mid-air into countless light needles as fine as hair, which descended upon Yun Che's entire body. The moment they touched his flesh, it was as if innumerable withered-yellow steel needles were piercing him from every limb, every pore, every seam in his bones, penetrating skin, flesh, blood, meridians, marrow... and the very depths of his soul. In an instant, all of Yun Che's consciousness was completely submerged in an indescribable agony.

An extreme itch, as if myriads of venomous ants were gnawing on every inch of his bones... An extreme pain, as if myriads of red-hot poison needles were frantically stabbing every part of his body... A torture that would make a demigod choose to end their own life midway through—its cruelty surpassed an ordinary person's understanding and imagination of the word "pain" by countless times. It was like magma incinerating his bones... like poisonous vines corroding his heart... like red-hot iron branding and stirring his marrow... like his soul being pressed onto barren gravel and repeatedly plowed, rubbed, and crushed...

Yun Che's features twisted violently. Every joint in his body spasmed and dislocated, and his veins bulged grotesquely as they tensed... Then, the flesh all over his body began to ripple and tremble, as if countless abyssal ticks were crawling and gnawing beneath his skin... It was every single cell in his body contorting and spasming in ultimate agony.

In a near-instant, cold sweat had soaked through Yun Che's outer robes, splashing down with his wildly trembling body, messily striking the ground of Eden's Cloud Summit and quickly spreading into a shocking wet patch.

Around him, the bodies and souls of the divine kingdom profound practitioners began to tremble as well. Then, one by one, they averted their gazes, unable to bear watching any longer. The horrifying physical reaction was a testament to the inhuman cruelty of the pain Yun Che was enduring.

And this pain had to last for a full one hundred breaths! No, for a double Wilderness Devouring Punishment... it had to be endured for a full two hundred breaths.

"Brother Yun..." Tears already stained Hua Caili's cheeks, her snowy face as pale as paper. If not for Hua Qingying supporting her, she would have collapsed the moment the punishment was inflicted upon Yun Che. From her bloodless lips came heart-shattering sobs.

Meng Kongchan pressed a hand to his chest, barely able to breathe. But he focused his soul, striving to maintain his composure as he called out, "Yuan'er, hold on... try to listen to my voice... Yuan'er, Yuan'er..."

One breath. Two breaths. Three breaths... Ten breaths!

Even the air seemed to be stained with a painful tremor, and the flawless, thin clouds were scattered by a sudden, cold wind... Yet, people began to realize with astonishment that Yun Che, whose body was being repeatedly flayed in a ten-thousand-fold purgatory, had not made a single sound.

Unseen by anyone, a strange light flickered in the depths of the Grand Divine Officer's eyes. He was present for every execution of the Wilderness Devouring Punishment, and occasionally administered it himself. But never had anyone... not even those few Divine Sovereign experts, managed to endure ten breaths without a sound.

Eleven breaths, twelve breaths... fifteen breaths...

The crowd's expressions shifted from initial horror to surprise, then to a deepening shock and disbelief.

Meng Kongchan suppressed the pain in his heart and called out in a gentle tone, "Yuan'er, you don't have to hold it in. Scream it out. Screaming can lessen the pain a little... It's alright, just scream, Yuan'er!"

He called out continuously, trying to stimulate and distract Yun Che's mind and soul, praying that he would not suffer a soul collapse. Too many who underwent this punishment had died by their own hand after their souls shattered.

Meng Jianxi was also shouting, "Brother Yuan, no one has ever lasted this long under the Wilderness Devouring Punishment without screaming in agony. You are truly worthy of your name... You are not only the pride of Dreamweaving; perhaps no one in the entire Abyss can match you. So, you can definitely endure... Even a double punishment will be powerless against you!!"

Crack! Crack! Crack...

A series of crisp, ear-piercing sounds of bone breaking rang out.

The Wilderness Devouring Punishment did not break the body or bones; that was the sound of Yun Che snapping his own knuckles. The shattered bone fragments pierced the flesh of his palms. Blood mixed with sweat dripped from between his fingers, and upon hitting the ground, it evaporated into a white mist with the stench of blood, silently dispersing into the air.

Hua Qingying reached out and covered Hua Caili's eyes. "Caili, don't look... It will be over soon."

Hua Caili's body was trembling almost as violently as Yun Che's. The horrifying torture inflicted upon his body was like ten thousand blades carving and gouging her own heart and soul. Yet she reached up, her hand trembling but resolute, and moved her aunt's³ hand away from her eyes. Her vision, completely blurred by a fog of tears, remained fixed on Yun Che's body without blinking.

"I... must... watch..." she murmured, each word like she was talking in her sleep. For her, this was perhaps the cruelest sight of her life, yet she was determined to burn every single moment of it into her eyes, to carve it into her soul.

Twenty breaths... Twenty-five breaths... Thirty breaths!

Yun Che's features were so distorted he no longer looked human. Blood foamed and sprayed from between his clenched teeth, yet still... not even a single muffled groan escaped him.

"What astonishing willpower," Cha Xing muttered, somewhat lost in a daze. His shock grew with every silent moment Yun Che endured.

Cha Xing's voice startled Xian Yue as if from a dream. He finally remembered to breathe, letting out a long sigh of heartfelt admiration. "If he can survive this ordeal, then this man... is someone I must befriend, no matter what."

Shen Wuyi suddenly reached out and pressed a hand hard against her chest, her crescent brows knitting together tightly. What's going on... Why is there a recurring sharp pain that I can neither suppress nor stop... Is it an internal injury left from my battle with Dian Jiuzhi...?
