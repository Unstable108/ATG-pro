A Divine Venerable¹ is so powerful that all living beings under their command are like insignificant ants. Yet, matching their immense power are their supreme majesty, status, and dignity. They would never condescend to easily strike down a weakling, much less tarnish their divine name for the sake of one.

But what if that Divine Venerable was a madwoman?

With the warning still ringing in his ears, Yun Che², who was alone at the moment, naturally did not wish to stir up trouble. He halted his steps, slowly retracting even his aura.

This soul-shaking aura³, distinct from that of other divine realms, was enough to reveal the notorious reputation of the Eternal Night Divine Realm⁴.

Only after they had gone far, completely vanishing from sight, did Yun Che let out a slight breath before continuing in his original direction.

People from the other five divine realms generally stepped into the Pure Land⁵ with a mix of reverence and excitement.

However, the atmosphere of the Eternal Night Divine Realm was entirely different.

A group of a hundred people, all stood in perfect formation, their auras contained. Even those among them who were visiting the Pure Land for the first time kept their eyes straight ahead, showing none of the excitement or curiosity naturally displayed by profound practitioners⁶ from other realms.

Even their footsteps carried an inexplicable lightness and caution, as if a single misstep would send them plummeting into an abyss of eternal damnation.

The extreme silence and oppressive atmosphere made it almost impossible to breathe, a feeling that even the gentle breeze of the Pure Land could not dispel.

Amidst them, surrounded by the group, was a sedan chair⁷, a sight long extinct in other divine realms, only occasionally found in smaller, lower-tier lands.

The dark drapes hanging on all four sides completely obscured the figure within the sedan chair, yet they could not block the chilling divine pressure that made one's soul tremble.

Even if the drapes of the sedan chair were lifted, one would still only see a veiled black curtain.

Divine Venerable Wu Ming⁸, Shen Wu Yan Ye⁹, had not shown her true face to anyone for too many years.

And no one would ever dare to probe the true appearance of the Divine Venerable beneath that black veil.

Sha Xing¹⁰ and Pan Bu Wang¹¹ watched from afar, unconsciously holding their breath. If they were to encounter Divine Venerables from other divine realms, Sha Xing, as a Star God Child¹², would certainly go forward to pay his respects.

Only with the Eternal Night Divine Realm did he keep his distance. The instructions he received as a Star God Child were also to avoid close contact.

After the Eternal Night Divine Realm group had moved far away, Sha Xing finally turned his head, his gaze lingering on Pan Bu Wang for a while before he said with deep meaning, "Elder Brother Bu Wang, your growth over these years is truly astonishing."

Just now, upon hearing the name "Eternal Night Divine Realm," the killing intent he exuded was startlingly strong. But now, as they drew near, his expression was indifferent and calm. The hatred and killing intent, clearly profound to his very bones, did not show even a trace outwardly.

Pan Bu Wang's gaze followed the direction the Eternal Night Divine Realm had taken, and he said faintly, "My intentions are not reckless, my hatred is not forgotten¹³."

Sha Xing stared at him for another moment, then let out a slight breath: "Elder Brother Bu Wang, frankly, now that you are no longer a God Child, I find myself unable to understand you. I was originally very much looking forward to the purpose of your 'no-holds-barred' journey to the Pure Land this time, but now, I'm actually a little worried."

Pan Bu Wang withdrew his gaze: "I didn't expect that after being stripped of my God Child title, there would still be someone in this world who would genuinely worry about me."

It was hard to discern the emotion in his words... whether he was expressing sorrow or relief.

Sha Xing smiled, saying sincerely, "We are friends, regardless of status."

"Mm, friends."

Pan Bu Wang also smiled, his gaze naturally shifting away.

However, at this moment, Sha Xing could not comprehend the complex, profound meaning hidden within his smile.

"The woman beside Divine Venerable Wu Ming's sedan chair should be the rather mysterious new Eternal Night Divine Maiden¹⁴, Shen Wu Yi¹⁵. It's a pity she's too far away, and her face is covered by a black veil, so I couldn't glimpse her true appearance."

"However, the time to meet the Abyss Emperor¹⁶ is approaching. This new Divine Maiden, whom Divine Venerable Wu Ming has deliberately hidden for many years, will soon reveal her true form. It's quite anticipated."

Shen Wu Yi's appearance was accompanied by the demise of Shen Wu Qing¹⁷.

After saying these words, Sha Xing had expected Pan Bu Wang to be deeply agitated.

But to his surprise, Pan Bu Wang, from his expression to his aura, remained utterly still and calm, like stagnant water.

Sha Xing frowned slightly... What exactly had Pan Bu Wang experienced during these three years since he left the Owl Butterfly Divine Realm¹⁸ and hid in the Mist Sea¹⁹? His state of mind had changed so drastically.

"To truly escape the abyss of the heart, one must face it directly. My desire to go to the Pure Land this time is because of the Mist Emperor's²⁰ words."

Recalling Pan Bu Wang's past words, Sha Xing's curiosity, anticipation, worry, and unease all quietly magnified at the same time.

The dark sedan chair stopped there, and the hundred accompanying individuals all stood neatly, not making a single sound.

"Wu Yi."

A hoarse, obscure voice emerged from the sedan chair, cutting into everyone's eardrums and souls.

Shen Wu Yi stepped forward, bowing respectfully: "I await Mother Goddess's²¹ command."

"Now, the Pure Land is beneath your feet. Tell this Venerable again, what is your purpose in coming to the Pure Land this time!"

Shen Wu Yi looked up, her jade-like face²² half-hidden, her words resolute: "To crush all God Children!"

This was the first Pure Land gathering after successfully opening the Abyss Passage²³, its significance undoubtedly extraordinary. It would likely directly determine the future direction of the Abyss World, serving as a prelude to entering the legendary "Eternal Pure Land²⁴."

All the divine realms harbored the same hope... except for the Eternal Night Divine Realm.

Because Shen Wu Yan Ye was a Divine Venerable whose thoughts and actions could absolutely not be judged by the term "Divine Venerable." In the eyes of other Divine Venerables, she was more like a completely deranged and disgraced madwoman.

Divine Venerable Wu Ming's soul-shaking voice rang out again: "Since this Venerable changed the realm's name to Eternal Night, my Eternal Night Divine Realm has existed in isolation from the other five divine realms²⁵. They call me Divine Venerable Wu Ming, but in reality, they despise me, mock me, laugh at my madness and obsession, and shun me as if I were a viper. The men of this world, even Divine Venerables and God Children, their flesh and blood, their lips and tongues, their souls, are all utterly filthy, hypocritical, and despicable to the point of being nauseating!"

Her voice grew hoarser, and more heart-wrenching.

"Wu Yi, this Venerable spared no resources or cost to cultivate you for twenty years, all for today!"

"At today's Pure Land gathering, you must tear off the masks of all God Children in this so-called supreme place, utterly crush their dignity, and make these filthy fools who deem themselves superior and despise my Eternal Night Divine Realm properly straighten their faces and see their own baseness."

She did not want defeat; she wanted complete crushing, trampling, and humiliation.

If people from other realms heard these words, they would undoubtedly be endlessly astonished and terrified.

But Shen Wu Yi was long accustomed to it. Her expression was unperturbed, her voice carrying flawless resolve and unwavering indifference: "Pan Bu Zhuo²⁶ of Owl Butterfly Divine Realm, Meng Jian Xi²⁷ of Dream Weaving Divine Realm²⁸, Sha Xing Xian Yue²⁹ of Star Moon Divine Realm³⁰, Dian Jiu Zhi³¹ of Sen Luo Divine Realm³²... Wu Yi will step over all of them!"

"After today, there will be no more 'First God Child³³' in the world! Only the name 'Wu Yi' bestowed by Mother Goddess will forever reign supreme over all God Children!"

A cold, chilling divine sound, like a terrifying voice from the depths of hell, came from within the sedan chair: "This Venerable tolerates no failure."

Shen Wu Yi lowered her head and said softly, "Wu Yi will tolerate failure even less than Mother Goddess."

"Very good."

The two obscure, low words were the highest praise Divine Venerable Wu Ming could give.

In front of the sedan chair, Shen Wu You Luan³⁴ and Shen Wu Ming Que³⁵ quietly exchanged glances, then quickly hid the apprehension and worry in their eyes. For a long time, they dared not look at Shen Wu Yi.

When would the eternal night that enveloped the divine realm finally welcome the dawn...?

Dian Jiu Zhi sat on the ground, his eyes closed, no profound energy³⁶ circulating around him. His expression was elegant and unperturbed... only the occasional slight movement of his eyebrows revealed that his heart was far from as calm as it appeared.

A silver barrier isolated everything in this place. Only Dian San Si³⁷ stood guard nearby. However, he was far from as calm as Dian Jiu Zhi, pacing back and forth, his features sometimes twitching, sometimes forcibly calming, his brows showing increasingly uncontrolled irritation.

A voice calling "Divine Venerable" sounded from outside the barrier. Dian San Si's steps faltered, his eyes shifting in confusion, then he gritted his teeth and rushed towards the outside of the barrier.

A hand suddenly reached out and firmly locked his wrist. Dian Jiu Zhi's voice came from behind him: "Are you going to disregard my warning and tell Father God³⁸ about this!?"

Dian San Si turned around, his eyes wide, his voice trembling slightly: "Elder Brother Jiu Zhi, you are the First God Child of the Six Divine Realms³⁹, the future Divine Venerable of my Sen Luo Divine Realm, the person I admire and respect most in my life... How can you endure such a monstrous humiliation!"

Dian Jiu Zhi's expression remained calm, his voice unruffled: "This is my choice, and you just promised me..."

"I don't understand!" Dian San Si, rarely, forcefully interrupted Dian Jiu Zhi's words, his eyes slightly red: "Elder Brother Jiu Zhi's marriage to Zhe Tian Divine Maiden⁴⁰ was arranged by Father God and Divine Venerable Hua Xin⁴¹ together, and even personally approved by the Abyss Emperor. Why does she, Zhe Tian Divine Maiden... and what is that Meng Jian Yuan⁴²! How dare he... how could he..."

His chest heaved, growing angrier as he spoke: "The right is on our side, the fault is his. They dared to commit such a disgraceful act, why must it be Elder Brother Jiu Zhi, why must it be us who endure it!!"

"San Si!!"

Dian Jiu Zhi let out a soft shout, his profound sound entering the soul⁴³ and dispelling most of the agitation in Dian San Si's eyes.

He sighed softly. Despite enduring heart-piercing pain and soul-gnawing humiliation, his voice was as gentle as a trickling stream: "Do you still remember why Father God bestowed upon you the name 'San Si'⁴⁴?"

Dian San Si's gaze steadied, his voice finally weakening: "How could I forget? Since childhood, I've been exceptionally talented, but also arrogant and impulsive, causing countless troubles, big and small. So Father God renamed me 'San Si,' allowing me to be bold and reckless in minor matters, but absolutely requiring me to think thrice and control myself in major affairs."

"Very good." Dian Jiu Zhi nodded gently: "Then think carefully now. If you expose this matter, what consequences will it bring?"

Dian San Si's thoughts were still chaotic, unable to answer immediately.

Dian Jiu Zhi continued: "Let me tell you. Among the Six Divine Realms, my Sen Luo, Zhe Tian, and Dream Weaving are the closest. This friendship between divine realms stems from the bond forged between Father God, Divine Venerable Hua Xin, and Divine Venerable Wu Meng⁴⁵ since childhood. This friendship has not been eroded by time or their respective titles as Divine Venerables; it has always remained unbreakable."

"With the support of this friendship between Divine Venerables, if one realm were to truly face disaster one day, the other two would certainly lend their full support. This is an invisible blessing that the other three divine realms cannot envy."

"But..." Dian Jiu Zhi's voice grew heavy, and his gaze shifted slightly: "Once this matter is exposed, especially here in the Pure Land where all Six Divine Realms are gathered, the precious and strong friendship between the three divine realms will be severed overnight. The mutual support between the three divine realms will also collapse with a crash... a complete collapse."

"It might even become a laughingstock that will be recounted for countless years."

Dian San Si's lips trembled, his mind buzzing. He knew that every word Dian Jiu Zhi said was perfectly correct, yet he still retorted through gritted teeth: "Then what about Zhe Tian Divine Maiden and Meng Jian Yuan? Why did they dare... why did they..."

Dian Jiu Zhi raised his hand and gently patted Dian San Si's shoulder: "Meng Jian Yuan is two jia zi⁴⁶ old this year and has just returned to the Dream Weaving Divine Realm. Cai Li⁴⁷... her true age in the world is still less than half a jia zi. They are ultimately too young, too inexperienced, and their understanding of the term 'divine realm' only scratches the surface. So they make mistakes due to a lack of understanding."

"But they can, and I cannot..."

"Elder Brother Jiu Zhi!"

Dian San Si interrupted him again. He looked up, staring at Dian Jiu Zhi's seemingly calm face: "If your forbearance is truly for the greater good of the divine realm, if what you say is truly what you think in your heart, then why don't you dare to look me in the eye when you say these things!"

Dian Jiu Zhi's lips moved, but no sound came out.

Dian San Si said: "I am already three jia zi old. I am no longer the naive child who needed Elder Brother Jiu Zhi's guidance in everything. On the contrary, my gaze and footsteps throughout my life have never stopped following Elder Brother Jiu Zhi. Therefore, I understand you better than most people."

"You... are actually protecting Zhe Tian Divine Maiden, aren't you?"

His words were slow, and though it was a question, each word was firm and undeniable.

Dian Jiu Zhi subconsciously shook his head. He opened his mouth, but facing Dian San Si's gaze, which held more pain than anger, the words about to come out were stuck in his throat, then turned into a light smile: "San Si, unknowingly, you have grown up."

His smile carried an undisguised bitterness.

Dian Jiu Zhi's words were undoubtedly an admission. However, Dian San Si's heart did not relax in the slightest; instead, it tightened even more, and his hands involuntarily clenched.

He looked up, his vision unconsciously blurring, and he murmured, "She... can hurt me a thousand times, ten thousand times, but I... will never, can never... will never hurt her once."

Dian San Si also looked up, his heart full of confusion and incomprehension: "I don't understand."

"You haven't met your 'Zhe Tian Divine Maiden' yet, so of course you don't understand." Dian Jiu Zhi's voice became as blurry as his gaze: "Do you still remember what I told you in front of the Ling Xian Divine Abode⁴⁸?"

After a brief moment of confusion, Dian San Si nodded: "I remember. Elder Brother Jiu Zhi said: 'Being admired is not fortune; finding someone for whom you are willing to give everything, that is the greatest fortune of a lifetime.'"

Dian Jiu Zhi's gaze returned, allowing Dian San Si to see the determination deep within his pupils: "These words are from the bottom of my heart. Even now, even if she hurts me ten times more, there is not a single word of reluctance. Because to me, she is not just someone I admire, but someone etched in my heart, my redeemer, my benefactor."

"Without her, I would never be able to stand here adorned with glory as I am now. Perhaps I would have long since died in a puddle of filth that no one would even glance at."

"So... San Si, putting aside the greater good of the divine realm, just for my sake, for the sake of this unworthy elder brother, temporarily forget this matter and deal with it slowly after we leave the Pure Land, okay?"

For the first time, Dian Jiu Zhi cast a pleading look at Dian San Si.

Dian San Si hastily averted his gaze. He could not bear such a look, nor could he utter words of refusal under such a gaze.

They both knew Dian Luo Hou's⁴⁹ temperament too well. He was as fiery as a raging inferno, valuing loyalty and integrity above all else. If he were to learn of this matter, even if they were in the Pure Land, he would surely rage to the heavens.

"I... understand."

Dian San Si's voice carried pain, not from the difficulty of agreeing, but from a deep sorrow for Dian Jiu Zhi.

Everyone had a weakness, but Dian Jiu Zhi's weakness seemed to have deeply rooted itself in his very lifeblood and the deepest parts of his soul.

"I'll give you another reason." He patted Dian San Si's shoulder again, his voice softening: "Although I am called the First God Child of the Six Divine Realms by the world, everyone actually knows that the main reason for this title is that I am backed by the most powerful Sen Luo Divine Realm, and my Father God is the First Divine Venerable of the Six Divine Realms."

"And my so-called highest cultivation is merely a accumulation of age. In terms of talent... not to mention Cai Li and Meng Jian Yuan, who possess perfect divine cores, within the divine realm, you are far superior to me at the same age, by far."

Dian San Si's heart fluttered, and he quickly said, "Elder Brother Jiu Zhi, please don't say that! You possess the Great Desolate Divine Veins⁵⁰, unique in this world; it's just that you started a little later..."

"That's a fact, no need to argue for me." Dian Jiu Zhi smiled: "So over these years, to live up to this so-called 'First God Child' title, I have never dared to be negligent in the slightest, nor can I endure any external damage... including reputation, including dignity."

"I understand." The same four words came out, much smoother than before.

He gritted his teeth, let out a heavy breath, and gathered enough determination in his eyes: "Elder Brother Jiu Zhi, I promise you, before leaving the Pure Land... no!! Before I get your permission, I will never tell anyone about today's matter, including Father God. If I break this vow..."

"San Si, thank you." Dian Jiu Zhi smiled, grateful: "Having you as a younger brother is another great fortune in my life."

Just then, an unexpected voice came from outside:

"Yun Che of Dream Weaving Divine Realm, specially comes to visit Divine Venerable Jue Luo⁵¹ and the Sen Luo God Child⁵²." If I have caused any disturbance, please forgive me."

The voice was gentle and elegant, like a breeze brushing the ear, yet it made Dian Jiu Zhi and Dian San Si freeze as if struck by thunder.
