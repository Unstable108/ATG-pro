The scene changed silently, but it was still within the Life God's Temple. The twisted and blurred images rippled like water.

"Master, who is she? So adorable."

She looked at the young girl sleeping peacefully in the crystal and exclaimed in amazement.

Yun Che's soul trembled violently.

It was Shen Xi's figure, Shen Xi's voice.

Although the image and sound were severely torn and blurred, Yun Che still recognized it instantly.

Although this voice carried the liveliness of a young girl, not the ethereal quality he was familiar with.

Li Suo softly said, "She will be my adopted daughter in the future, and she will also be a good friend of yours. It's just that I haven't had time to give her a name yet."

"A name..." Shen Xi thought for a moment, then said playfully, "Today, all the Wuhu flowers in the Holy Garden are in full bloom. It's so beautiful, as if they are welcoming her arrival. So, let's call her Wanhu, okay?"

Li Suo smiled and nodded slightly. "Okay."

Her voice was always so gentle, with a hint of indulgence, but without the majesty that a supreme god should have.

A voice came from outside the temple, "Ling Zhen, the current patriarch of the Sword Spirit God Clan, has come to pay his respects to Lady Li Suo by summons."

"Xi'er, you may leave for now."

"Yes, Master."

A tall man, whose imposing aura was still evident even in the blurred fragments of memory, walked in quickly and bowed deeply. "This lowly god, Ling Zhen, pays his respects to Lady Li Suo. May I ask why Lady Li Suo has summoned me?"

Li Suo did not answer immediately but turned her gaze to the girl in the crystal.

Ling Zhen followed her gaze and exclaimed in surprise, "The Eternal Hub!?"

"This lowly god remembers that the Eternal Hub was a gift from Lord Xi Ke to Lord Ni Xuan. It contains eternal power and serves as the core foundation of the Elemental God Pagoda, ensuring its eternal stability. Why is it here? And there's a young girl inside..."

He stopped speaking, not daring to say anything out of line.

Li Suo said, "There is no longer an Elemental God of Creation in this world, nor is there an Elemental God Pagoda."

Ling Zhen frowned and looked up, utterly astonished.

"You don't need to ask further. This is the will of heaven, and it cannot be changed." Her voice carried a rare sadness and helplessness for a God of Creation.

"I summoned you here today to entrust this young girl to you."

Ling Zhen respectfully said, "This lowly god will naturally obey Lady Li Suo's command. But... why me?"

Li Suo explained softly, "Her name is Wanhu, and both her body and soul are extremely special. I have reshaped her body and soul. However, one part of her soul is a sword soul. This sword soul is half-damaged, but it is still incredibly unique. I have repaired it with my holy light power, but no matter what, I cannot make it merge with her body."

"Patriarch Ling Zhen, years ago, your young daughter Si Yao suffered an early death. To remember her, you preserved her sword soul. I hope you can merge Si Yao's sword soul with hers, using it as a guide to allow the new sword soul to merge with her body. When she awakens, she will be your daughter, Ling Zhen."

Ling Zhen's eyes trembled violently, and he suddenly knelt heavily, his voice shaking, "I, Ling Zhen, would willingly die ten thousand deaths to fulfill Lady Li Suo's holy command. But... my daughter Si Yao had a tragic fate. As her father, I failed her throughout her life. Every time I think of her, it brings me unbearable pain. And her sword soul is the last trace of her in this world."

"Only this matter, only regarding Si Yao, I beg Lady Li Suo to take back her holy command..."

Li Suo said softly, "She is Ni Xuan's daughter."

Ling Zhen's voice stopped abruptly. He turned his gaze and stared intently at the girl in the Eternal Hub. Suddenly, he shook his head vigorously and said with utmost determination, "The grace of Lord Ni Xuan is something my Sword Spirit God Clan can never repay, even after ten thousand generations. From this moment on, she is my daughter, Ling Zhen! She is the most honored little princess of my Sword Spirit God Clan."

"I, Ling Zhen, swear on my life that I will give her a life of peace and joy. Even if the entire clan is destroyed, I will not let her suffer any harm or sorrow."

His words were powerful and resolute, like a divine decree.

"Good." Li Suo nodded gently. "With Patriarch Ling Zhen's words, Ni Xuan can rest assured."

"However, do not let anyone, including herself, know her true origins."

"Lady Li Suo, rest assured," Ling Zhen's voice was still trembling. "I will not ask anything, and no one will know anything."

The scene faded into a vast expanse of white mist and then completely dissipated.

"It seems that this is indeed the memory fragment you gave to Senior Evil God," Yun Che said with mixed emotions. "Probably to inform him of his daughter's whereabouts. And Senior Evil God has always carefully treasured it, even keeping it until his last remaining soul... Perhaps this was his only solace in his final years."

"So, Hong'er entered the Sword Spirit God Clan in such a way."

"And her sword soul is so complex. Her own incomplete sword soul inherited from the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor, stripped of its dark components... reshaped by Ni Xuan's power... repaired by Li Suo's holy power... and finally merged with the complete sword soul of the Sword Spirit Clan's patriarch's daughter."

"The holy power of her sword form comes from Li Suo... It completely matches the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor's furious guess at that time."

"And her strange ability to devour and merge with swords, could it be a heretical power derived from the combination of the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor, the Elemental God of Creation, the Life God of Creation, and the Sword Spirit God Clan?"

"I'm a little curious," Li Suo said softly. "That girl named Ni Jie, what was the secret she wanted to tell me?"

Yun Che, however, had no interest in this. "The era of gods and devils is long over. Whatever secrets of that era are no longer important."

At this moment, he remembered a question the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor had asked him:

"Yun Che, do you think I should merge their souls back together?"

(↑ Chapter 1461)

And he chose to dissuade her, reasoning that both Hong'er and You'er had become independent individuals. If they were merged, it would be equivalent to erasing their two existences.

It was this remark that made the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor decisively abandon this idea.

Thinking about it now, the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor clearly saw at a glance that Hong'er and You'er could be merged back together, and after their fusion, they would become the former Ni Jie.

In other words, Li Suo had agreed to Ni Jie's request back then.

This is also why Hong'er, both in body and mind, has always been a young girl, as if she will never grow up.

Back then, he dissuaded the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor from merging Hong'er and You'er. Naturally, he himself would not try this idea. Therefore, this possibility, left by Ni Jie's request and Li Suo's kindness, did not have much impact on him.

He even had a fleeting thought: even if Hong'er, who had undergone such a strange transformation, could truly merge with You'er again, would the "restored" Ni Jie still be the same Ni Jie as before?

"It is indeed not that important," Li Suo expressed her agreement. "Then, did this memory that Ni Xuan specifically left for you have a great impact on you? For example... did it change your original state of mind, understanding, and... way of dealing with 'him'?"

Yun Che did not answer.

After a long time, he seemed to be talking to himself, "The Heaven Punishing God Emperor said two names... Panming's Void Shattering Mirror and Nirvana Devil's Wheel of Time."

"He called them 'supreme devil artifacts' and their powers 'dual seals of space and time,' which even the Heaven Punishing God Emperor could not break free from."

"The Devil Queen's guess at that time has been completely fulfilled. They are the 'Nether Mirror' and 'Devil Pearl' that the Devil Queen mentioned at that time."

"The pierced abyssal passage, the black tide of time, and the cradle..."

Yun Che took a long breath.

Li Suo said, "Are you worried that Panming's Void Shattering Mirror and Nirvana Devil's Wheel of Time are both in his hands?"

"Not worried," Yun Che's voice was slightly heavy. "It's almost certain. Everything I know points to this."

"Even so, there is no need to worry too much," Li Suo consoled. "Although the power level of the Abyss is higher than the God Realm, it is still far inferior to the era of gods and devils. Therefore, the power of the Nether Mirror and the Devil Pearl must not have recovered to their ancient levels."

"In addition, the Nether Mirror and the Devil Pearl are ultimately devil artifacts, and 'he' is a god, destined to be unable to fully control them. Based on what we know so far, 'he' needs to gather the power of all the true gods in the Abyss every time he activates the Nether Mirror, which should be due to this reason."

Yun Che fell silent again, and the sound of his slow and steady heartbeat echoed in his soul sea.

"It seems that I need to adjust my strategy slightly."

In the Calming Heart Formation, Yun Che slowly opened his eyes.

As soon as he walked out, he was met with Meng Kongchan's ambiguous smile. "Young people, after all, still couldn't restrain themselves."

Yun Che was startled, then understood.

He sensed Hua Caili's aura, lingering not far away. She had obviously arrived long ago but was inconvenient to approach, so she could only wait for him to meet her.

Yun Che followed suit and said, "Senior God Venerable, I wonder... is it convenient?"

"Convenient! Why wouldn't it be convenient!" Meng Kongchan said straightforwardly, "Two perfect divine inheritances appearing in one era, this is a double divine miracle unprecedented in history. It's only natural for the two of you to interact."

"However, if other Divine Kingdoms arrive, you still need to be mindful of propriety. You have a long future ahead, so there's no need to rush things... especially the Senluo Divine Kingdom."

"I understand. Don't worry, Caili and I will not do anything inappropriate before you pave the way for us."

Yun Che responded, then said to Meng Jianxi, "God Child Xi, I'll have to trouble you to keep an eye on the movements of the other Divine Kingdoms. If other Divine Kingdoms arrive, I hope you can inform me immediately via soul sound."

Walking out of the courtyard, Yun Che saw Hua Caili's figure at a glance. Even in this pure land, as beautiful as an illusion, her figure was still too captivating.

Hua Caili's beautiful eyes flashed, and a smile bloomed. A gorgeous sword light flashed, and she stood gracefully in front of Yun Che.

"Your father actually let you out?" Yun Che said with a smile.

Neither of them moved forward, maintaining a restrained distance of three steps.

"I made a lot of promises to get out. And once other Divine Kingdoms arrive, I have to go back."

Hua Caili complained, but her eyebrows were still curved. "Brother Yun, come with me quickly. I'll take you to meet someone."

"Uh... okay, where's your aunt?"

"Aunt went to see the Great Divine Official. There won't be any danger in the Pure Land, so she won't follow me."

She took Yun Che, with a smile, and flew lightly towards a bright white area in the north of the Pure Land.

At the same time, a powerful roar echoed outside the Pure Land's light realm.

The main profound ark of the Senluo Divine Kingdom had arrived.
