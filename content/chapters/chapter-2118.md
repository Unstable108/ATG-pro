The Pure Land was vast and empty, pure and tranquil, as if eternally free of dust and defilement. It was like another independent world completely separated from the Abyssal World. Anyone who came here would inevitably be cautious and trembling, but Hua Caili was clearly an exception.

She smiled sweetly, her figure graceful. She was exceptionally familiar with every place here, and could even directly call out the names and titles of most of the Abyssal Knights and Pure Land Divine Guards she encountered. When the Abyssal Knights and Pure Land Divine Guards saw her, they all respectfully greeted her, some even smiling, and none showed any intention of stopping or questioning her.

After passing through an open space, the world in front of them suddenly became colorful, with myriad trees and flowers coming into view, like a fairyland within a fairyland. The elemental aura of the Pure Land was already extremely rich, but here it was several times richer, and mainly consisted of fire, thunder, and wind... At the same time, there was an unusual and somewhat incongruous chill in the air.

Among the myriad trees were several small houses, like the secluded dwellings of recluses. Unfortunately, there were no birds or insects as there should have been.

"Could this be the dwelling place of the Divine Official Lingxian?" Yun Che asked, looking ahead.

Hua Caili was surprised. "Brother Yun is so amazing. Even though it's your first time in the Pure Land, you guessed it right away."

At this moment, the space ahead rippled like waves, and a woman's figure emerged from the flowers and trees, smiling at the two of them. "Little Caili is here."

The woman was dressed in a plain white robe, sparsely adorned with a few light pink autumn plum blossoms. Her complexion was fair, her age indiscernible. Her long hair was tied up with a simple band, her gaze gentle and calm, a faint smile on her lips, like a recluse who had lived in the mountains for a long time, unconcerned with worldly affairs. If one ignored the terrifying and unparalleled invisible spiritual pressure emanating from her...

"Aunt Sushang!" Hua Caili called out affectionately and quickly walked up to her.

As she approached, she sensed the presence of the chill and her eyes narrowed. "This chill... Could it be that Granny Lingxian..."

"Yes," the woman nodded gently. "The master knew you would be coming these days and has been talking about it, but unfortunately, her old illness suddenly flared up."

At this point, her gaze turned to Yun Che. "This is?"

Yun Che stepped forward and respectfully bowed. "Yun Che of the Weaving Dream Divine Realm greets Senior Sushang."

The four words "Aunt Sushang" that Hua Caili had called out couldn't help but make his heart race. Because this was the ultimate existence beneath the Abyssal God, one of the four strongest Divine Guards of the Pure Land, and the personal attendant of the Divine Official Lingxian!

With such a plain and elegant appearance, no one would ever imagine that she was such a terrifying existence.

"Yun Che?" Divine Attendant Sushang was faintly surprised, then understood. "So it's the former God Child Meng Jianyuan, who was found by the Weaving Dream Divine Realm. As rumored, he is indeed dignified and handsome. Setting aside your perfect divine persona, which is similar to Caili's, your appearance alone surpasses Meng Jianxi by a lot."

Her words were exceptionally direct and straightforward, even when referring to the God Child of a Divine Realm.

Yun Che said without any change in expression, "Senior, you flatter me. I came here this time hoping to be introduced by Divine Maiden Caili and have the honor of seeing the divine presence of the Divine Official Lingxian."

Sushang still smiled faintly. "Young Master Yuan won't be able to fulfill his wish this time. The master is not available to see guests at the moment."

"It's okay, it's okay," Hua Caili quickly said. "Then we won't disturb her. We'll come to see Granny Lingxian later."

But Yun Che did not move. Instead, he held out a small jade box. "Since that's the case... This is a gift I prepared for the Divine Official Lingxian before coming to the Pure Land. Please, Senior Sushang, accept it on her behalf."

"Huh?" Hua Caili looked surprised. She hadn't expected Yun Che to have prepared a gift.

"There's no need," Sushang said faintly. "My master does not touch the dust of the world or accept worldly gifts. I will convey Young Master Yuan's regards to her."

But Hua Caili reached out, took the jade box from Yun Che's hand, and directly stuffed it into Divine Attendant Sushang's hand. She said playfully, "Aunt Sushang, this is a gift that Brother Yun specially prepared for Granny Lingxian. He must have put a lot of thought into it. Granny Lingxian is so gentle, she definitely wouldn't have the heart to refuse. Just accept it on her behalf."

Looking at the jade box that had been forced into her hand, Sushang shook her head and smiled, half helplessly and half indulgently. "Alright, then I'll accept it on behalf of the master. Caili, if you have time, you can take Young Master Yuan to see the Lingxian Colorful Cloud Realm nearby, but remember not to get too close to this place."

"No, it's not good to disturb Granny Lingxian." Hua Caili bowed gracefully. "Aunt Sushang, then we won't disturb you anymore. After we see Uncle Abyss Emperor, we'll come back to visit Granny Lingxian."

Yun Che and Hua Caili left. Looking at their departing figures and recalling Hua Caili's words and obviously unusual gaze, Divine Attendant Sushang was thoughtful.

She picked up the jade box in her hand and casually opened it.

Spiritual energy overflowed, and her originally calm expression suddenly froze. The jade box between her fingers was immediately raised to her eyes. Immediately, the deep red light reflected in her rapidly dilating pupils due to excessive excitement and disbelief.

"..........."

She quickly turned around and directly entered the cold barrier she had just been guarding...

"I heard from the Dreamless God Venerable that the Divine Official Lingxian often suffers from 'elemental devouring body'¹ due to her special innate constitution. Just now, Divine Attendant Sushang said that her 'old illness flared up'... Could it be referring to 'elemental devouring body'?"

"Yes," Hua Caili nodded, her expression showing obvious concern. "Moreover, Granny Lingxian's... the frequency of the attacks seems to be increasing. The last attack was more than four years ago when I just left the Pure Land."

She looked back, her beautiful eyes filled with worry, and said softly, "I've seen what Granny Lingxian looks like when she has an attack. It's really scary. Even someone as powerful as Granny Lingxian shows such a painful expression."

"She once said something to me. She said... a long life is the desire of countless living beings, but it is a great torment for her."

"But she can't die, because there is someone who needs her."

Yun Che: "..."

Hua Caili sighed softly. "Granny Lingxian almost never leaves the Pure Land unless she has no other choice. She even said that in the eyes of the world, she is a noble and powerful Divine Official, but in reality, she is just a caged bird plagued by illness."

"The gentle and kind Granny Lingxian has been suffering so much pain."

Yun Che pondered and said, "She can't easily leave the Pure Land because... is her essence that of a beast?"

Abyss Dust's erosion of beasts was far greater than that of humans. The Divine Official Lingxian was a descendant of the Vermillion Bird, so she belonged to the beast race and naturally feared Abyss Dust greatly.

"Huh?" Hua Caili looked surprised. "Brother Yun, you already knew? But..."

She moved closer to Yun Che and lowered her voice. "You must never say this outside, especially in front of Granny Lingxian. She actually minds this very much."

"Oh? Why?" Yun Che was puzzled. As descendants of ancient gods, they must have pride in their origins etched in their blood. The Divine Officials of the Pure Land were existences below only one emperor of the abyss and above all other beings, so they should be arrogant. Why would they care about their race?

Unless...

Hua Caili looked around, hesitated for a moment, but still didn't speak. Instead, she said softly, "After we leave the Pure Land, I'll tell you secretly."

"I see... Alright." Yun Che suddenly stopped at this moment.

Hua Caili also stopped and looked at him in confusion. But Yun Che suddenly moved forward, closing the distance they had deliberately kept, close enough to clearly feel each other's warm breath.

"Brother Yun..." Hua Caili's breathing became disordered, but she didn't have the rationality to retreat.

Yun Che lowered his eyes, his soft gaze falling into her beautiful eyes. "Everything else can wait until after we leave the Pure Land. But I have a gift that I've been preparing for three years, and I really want... I can't wait to give it to you."

"What... what is it?" Such a close distance, and the gaze and voice that were only for her, undoubtedly stirred the emotions and longing that Hua Caili had suppressed for three years, making her heart beat faster, her mind more chaotic, and her clarity gradually fading.

"You... close your eyes first," Yun Che said with a mysterious look and just the right amount of nervousness.

Hua Caili obediently closed her eyes, her snowy face full of anticipation.

"Hmm... still not good. You have to withdraw all your spiritual sense. You can't secretly sense it." The mystery and nervousness in Yun Che's voice increased.

"I didn't," she pouted her lips slightly, but immediately obediently withdrew all her spiritual sense and raised her face slightly. "Is this okay now?"

Mystery breeds greater anticipation. Even if she hadn't withdrawn her spiritual sense, Hua Caili could basically only sense her own rapid heartbeat and Yun Che's aura, and had no mind for anything else.

She felt Yun Che's aura getting closer and closer, the warmth spreading from her forehead to her cheeks, and then gently touching her lips.

She quietly opened her eyes and saw Yun Che, who was very close, with a mischievous look on his face.

"Did you receive it?" Yun Che tilted his mouth, a smile of success on his face. "I've accumulated three years of longing."

The girl's beautiful eyes fully opened, but instead of showing any disappointment or annoyance, she suddenly took a small step forward, wrapped her arms tightly around Yun Che's neck, kissed him back heavily, and her snow-white teeth gently bit his lower lip, not letting him easily break free.

After a while, she released her teeth, her cheeks flushed, but she said defiantly, "See, I clearly have more longing."

The girl was immersed in a world that was too beautiful, completely unaware that in the distant space of the Pure Land, two blurry figures were approaching.

"Brother Jiuzhi, you didn't go to visit the Folding Heaven Divine Realm, but came here directly. Are you so sure that Divine Maiden Caili is here?" Dian Sansi asked with great interest while looking around the world of the Pure Land.

He was the most outstanding Imperial Son of the Senluo Divine Realm after Dian Jiuzhi. He was not yet three jiazi (60 years?) old, but he already had the cultivation of the third level of the Divine Extinction Realm, surpassing Dian Jiuzhi of the past. His Senluo Myriad Manifestations Art was already initially formed.

He was still young and had not experienced the most unbearable period of Dian Jiuzhi's past, so he respected and admired him greatly.

Dian Jiuzhi smiled, clearly in a very good mood. "Every time Caili comes to the Pure Land, she always goes to see the Divine Official Lingxian first. This time should be no exception."

Dian Sansi sighed. "Although Brother Jiuzhi and Divine Maiden Caili are often apart, you know everything about her so thoroughly. To have Brother Jiuzhi's affection, Divine Maiden Caili is truly extremely fortunate."

"No, you're wrong." Dian Jiuzhi smiled and shook his head. "The fortunate one has always been me. Without Caili, I wouldn't be where I am today. Moreover... being admired is not fortunate. Finding someone you are willing to give everything for is the greatest fortune of a lifetime."

"Yes!" Dian Sansi nodded. "I will remember all of Brother Jiuzhi's words. However, I don't believe that there is a woman in this world who would make me willing to treat her as Brother Jiuzhi treats Divine Maiden Caili."

"Hahahaha!" Dian Jiuzhi laughed loudly. "You are still young. When I was your age, I also would never have believed that such a person could exist in this world."

Dian Sansi's eyes were full of anticipation. "Although I have never had the honor of meeting Divine Maiden Caili, I have seen her portraits and projections countless times at Brother Jiuzhi's place. She is truly peerlessly beautiful. I wonder what the real Divine Maiden Caili..."

"Portraits and projections can't depict even a ten-thousandth of Caili's beauty," Dian Jiuzhi interrupted him with a smile. "When you see her, you will truly understand what..."

His voice suddenly slowed down, until it was stuck in his throat, and his footsteps stopped there uncontrollably.

Dian Sansi also stopped and was about to ask a question when he suddenly saw the two figures in front of him. They were embracing each other, lost in their own world, as if they were so moved by their emotions that they had completely disregarded the fact that this was the supreme Pure Land.

The man was handsome and elegant, surpassing even Dian Jiuzhi in appearance. And the woman... her beauty made this fairyland of the Pure Land a mere backdrop to her immortal beauty. Her beautiful eyes were fixed on the man in front of her, as if he was the only thing in her world, and nothing else could enter it.

Dian Sansi's eyes widened in shock. Because the woman's appearance and beauty were clearly... No, it was impossible!

He quickly looked at Dian Jiuzhi, only to find that his face was a ghastly pale. His hands were trembling, his whole body was shaking violently, and his eyes, which had been full of gentle light just a moment ago, were now trembling as if they were about to shatter. The rapidly dilating pupils almost filled his entire eyeballs.

"Nine... Brother Jiuzhi?" Dian Sansi's throat suddenly felt a little dry.

This low call seemed to pull Dian Jiuzhi out of a sudden nightmare. His gaze slowly turned, and then he closed his eyes. When he opened them again, they were still trembling with pain, and even his tightly clenched hands couldn't suppress the trembling that came from the depths of his soul.

"Let's... go." He made a sound, but it was so hoarse that it was grating. The gaze that had been pulled back did not dare to look in that direction again.

"Brother Jiuzhi!" Dian Sansi stepped forward and grabbed his trembling arm. "That person, she... could it be... could it really be..."

"...Go!" Dian Jiuzhi's voice was even hoarser, but still very soft, as if he was afraid of disturbing the figures in the distance... even though his heart and soul were already in agony.

At this point, even if Dian Sansi wanted to deceive himself, he could no longer do so.

His brows furrowed, and anger surged within him. "How dare she... How dare she! Brother Jiuzhi is so deeply in love with her, and they even have a marriage contract bestowed by the Yuan Emperor. How dare she... how dare she treat Brother Jiuzhi like this!"

"No! We must..."

A hand pressed on his shoulder, firmly suppressing his anger and overflowing aura.

"Are you not listening to me!?" His voice, his expression, was terrifyingly unfamiliar to Dian Sansi. "Forget what you just saw. Don't tell anyone, especially Father God, do you hear me!?"

Dian Sansi stared at him, at his features that were constantly twisting even though he was trying his best to control them. After a long while, he nodded numbly. "I hear you... Don't worry, Brother Jiuzhi, I won't tell anyone."

Dian Jiuzhi's chest heaved, and he exhaled a long, trembling breath. Then he pulled Dian Sansi, suppressed his aura, and silently walked away.

His footsteps had never been as heavy as they were at this moment... even when he was mired in the mud in the past.

It wasn't until they were far away that Yun Che gently released Hua Caili, whom he had been holding in his arms.

Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of the position where Dian Jiuzhi had just appeared for a moment, and a gentle smile still hung on his lips.

"Caili, if our behavior just now was accidentally seen by someone from the Pure Land, what would happen?"

"Hmph, you still have the nerve to say that." Hua Caili drew several circles in Yun Che's palm with her jade finger before reluctantly letting go, and then moved three steps away. "Granny Lingxian's fairyland is the most tranquil, and there are no Divine Guards stationed there, so there's no need to worry about being seen. But it's best not to mess around in other places, otherwise, I'm afraid it might really disrupt Father God and the Dreamless God Venerable's arrangements."

"Yes, I know," Yun Che quickly responded with a serious face. "I promise to stay at least three steps away from you."

"Come, I'll take you to another place. That person will definitely like you."

Not knowing what she was thinking, Hua Caili's lips curved up slightly, and she smiled mysteriously.
