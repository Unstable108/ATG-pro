Facing the Dreamweaving God Child's¹ proactive conversation, the Dragon Lord² felt a slight sense of being flattered.

"Long Jiang³?"

After a brief moment of surprise, the Dragon Lord understood, but did not answer directly. Instead, he probed, "May I ask why the Abyss God Child⁴ inquires about this person? Do you perhaps have some acquaintance with her?"

"Acquaintance, not really," Yun Che⁵ replied candidly. "Before returning to Dreamweaving, this junior was always wandering alone. Once, I almost met with disaster and was saved by someone who called herself 'Long Jiang,' after which she disappeared without a trace."

"After this junior returned to Dreamweaving, I always wanted to find this person to repay her kindness. However, among the names of the Dragon Clan⁶ recorded in Xuanji Hall⁷, there was no 'Long Jiang,' which meant this junior had no way to repay the favor. Today, I am fortunate to meet Senior Dragon Lord, so I came to inquire."

"So that's how it is."

The Dragon Lord felt relieved and chuckled, "Indeed, there is no one named 'Long Jiang' in my Dragon Clan. However, there is a dragon maiden who often calls herself 'Long Jiang' when traveling outside."

Yun Che's face showed eagerness, "May I ask who this dragon maiden is?"

The Dragon Lord said, "The Abyss God Child must have heard this maiden's name... Long Xi⁸."

A perfectly timed look of astonishment flashed across Yun Che's face: "Long Xi... that Scar-faced Dragon Girl⁹?"

After the astonishment, a gradual realization dawned: "No wonder, I clearly felt she was very young, yet her cultivation was exceptionally high. So it turns out she is..."

At this point, he suddenly changed the subject, somewhat puzzled: "The name 'Scar-faced Dragon Girl' is well-known to this junior. Some time ago, I heard news from Xuanji Hall that the Scar-faced Dragon Girl had successfully broken through to the Divine Annihilation Realm¹⁰. Is this true?"

"It is indeed true." The Dragon Lord nodded, a hint of pride on his face, which quickly faded.

Yun Che exclaimed, "It is often said that cultivation is extremely difficult for the Dragon Clan. The Young Dragon Lord, Long Wangchu¹¹, possesses the Ancestral Dragon¹² bloodline and talent that surpasses the entire clan, yet it still took him five jiazi¹³ to reach the Divine Master Realm¹⁴. Although his progress has been rapid in recent years, he has still not touched the Divine Annihilation Realm. Yet Long Xi, at less than two jiazi of age, has achieved the Half-God¹⁵ stage."

"At least according to Xuanji Hall's records, this is an unprecedented feat for the Dragon Clan. With such an astonishing dragon maiden, why did the Dragon Lord not bring her to this Pure Land Assembly¹⁶?" The expressions of Long Chixin¹⁷ and Long Qianxin¹⁸ behind the Dragon Lord simultaneously became complex.

The Dragon Lord let out a bitter laugh, saying, "Abyss God Child, you may not know, but my Dragon Clan has always been led by the Ancestral Dragon lineage. Among the direct descendants below this old man, there is only Wangchu today."

"Long Xi's talent is peerless, unmatched in the history of the Dragon Clan that this old man has witnessed. She also possesses the Ancestral Dragon bloodline, but she belongs to an external lineage, and this old man has yet to discover the origin of her Ancestral Dragon bloodline."

The Dragon Lord's eyes were clouded, and he spoke with self-deprecation, "Wangchu's profound cultivation talent is acceptable within the Dragon Clan, but compared to the various God Children... Heh, if he were brought here, it would only invite ridicule."

"This junior understands."

Yun Che nodded knowingly, "Since the Young Dragon Lord is not present, there is naturally no reason to bring other juniors."

"It's shameful to admit, but it is indeed so." The Dragon Lord sighed again. Throughout his life, the Dragon Lord had met countless people and had long grown indifferent to everything outside of his lineage.

But the man before him, bearing a miraculous divine spark and a revered status, was gentle in appearance, elegant in demeanor, calm yet not arrogant, and moreover, deeply valued kindness and righteousness. This made the Dragon Lord feel an unusual fondness for him at first sight, and he proactively said, "I'm not afraid of the Abyss God Child laughing at me, but this old man has tried more than once to adopt Long Xi as my goddaughter. However, each time I was rejected, and with no room for negotiation or hope."

He spoke with self-deprecation, "If I had succeeded, perhaps I could have brought her to the Pure Land as my goddaughter this time, allowing the Abyss Emperor¹⁹ to see her. Alas."

"Why is that?"

Yun Che's face showed the most appropriate confusion: "For a daughter of the Dragon Clan, shouldn't that be an unparalleled honor?"

"For others, yes. But Long Xi, that child..."

The Dragon Lord shook his head, "Her personality is extremely reclusive, and her nature possesses an incomprehensible stubbornness. She is unwilling to interact with anyone and will not show any pleasantries to anyone. It has been like this for decades, and this old man is no exception."

Yun Che seemingly casually asked, "If that's the case, wouldn't she be disliked in the Dragon Clan and in a precarious situation?"

"Not necessarily."

The Dragon Lord smiled faintly, "Because of her reclusive and eccentric personality, this old man specifically gave her a secluded place and ordered that no one should approach without her permission. Therefore, over the years, she either travels for experience or stays in her own domain. Everyone in the Dragon Clan knows her temperament and never actively provokes her, so they live in peace."

Perhaps it was a misconception, but after saying these words, the Dragon Lord felt that Yun Che's aura seemed to soften slightly.

Yun Che raised his hand and bowed respectfully, "Thank you, Senior Dragon Lord, for your generous information. Since I know Long Jiang is Long Xi, this junior must choose a day to visit the Ancestral Dragon Mountain Range²⁰ to seek a meeting. May I ask if it would be convenient for you, senior?"

The Dragon Lord quickly raised his hand, "It's a small matter, Abyss God Child, there's no need to be so formal. If the Abyss God Child comes, my Dragon Clan will naturally welcome you wholeheartedly, and any time is convenient. However, given Long Xi's temperament... the Abyss God Child should be mentally prepared."

"Whether to meet or not, it's her decision, of course. This junior will never force it, nor will I intrude forcefully," Yun Che said with a frank expression.

At this point, he naturally asked, "Speaking of which, during my brief encounter with Long Jiang... uh, Long Xi, I seemed to notice she was searching for something."

"..."

The Dragon Lord's eyebrows twitched slightly.

"Does the Dragon Lord know anything about this? If she hasn't found it yet, this junior will certainly do my utmost to help her find it, to repay her kindness."

The Dragon Lord did not deny it: "Long Xi is indeed diligently searching for certain unusual items, but this matter involves some of her secrets. Even as the Dragon Lord, this old man cannot speak of it without permission. I ask for the Abyss God Child's understanding."

"This junior overstepped," Yun Che caught a fleeting, unusual glint in the Dragon Lord's eyes, feeling a slight suspicion in his heart, but could no longer press the matter.

The information he gathered from the Dragon Lord was no different from what he had learned from Xuanji Hall over the years. The Dragon Lord was very fond of Long Xi, had tried to adopt her as a goddaughter multiple times... allowed Long Xi to have her own private domain, forbidding anyone else from approaching... and never allowed anyone to bully her. At least, she was safe and sound there, with sufficient freedom and the Dragon Lord's protection.

At this moment, Yun Che's respectful bow to the Dragon Lord was sincere, carrying deep respect and gratitude from his heart. Suddenly, the surrounding atmosphere condensed, and even the sounds quieted. Yun Che's gaze instinctively shifted, piercing through layers of clouds and mist, touching a rapidly approaching dark silhouette. Meng Jianxi²¹ quickly came to Yun Che's side and whispered, "It's the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom²². Yuan Di²³, including Wuming Divine Venerable²⁴, do not need to be greeted. It's best not to approach them at all."

"...Yuan Di?" Not receiving a response for a moment, Meng Jianxi looked at Yun Che with slight surprise, only to find his eyes strangely dazed.

Realizing his unusual state, Yun Che looked back and nodded, "Understood. But this Wuming Divine Venerable's divine pressure... is very special."

Thump! Thump! Thump!! He inexplicably heard the sound of his own heart beating, incredibly violently. What was happening... was it the oppressive feeling brought by Wuming Divine Venerable's arrival?

No... even when sensing the Abyss Emperor's gaze, even when facing a Great Divine Official, it wouldn't be like this... His hand unconsciously touched his chest. What exactly is it... what in this Abyss World could make my soul tremble so violently... He let out a long breath, but the violent throbbing of his heart still wouldn't subside, instead, it grew more and more intense.

"It can probably be considered a hateful and resentful aura that repels everything, naturally making one uncomfortable," Meng Jianxi explained in a low voice, not noticing Yun Che's abnormality.

Where everyone's gazes converged, the dark silhouette had already stepped onto the summit of Eden Cloud, appearing particularly striking in this excessively pure white world. The accompanying aura was like a Nine Nether Cold Spring²⁵ pouring down, making everyone feel cold all over, inexplicably terrified. Unlike the chilling and oppressive dark divine pressure released by Qiheng Divine Venerable, this was a bone-chilling cold that seeped directly into the soul and marrow, as if, invisibly, the venomous fangs of a highly poisonous snake were pressed against one's throat.

All the juniors from the Divine Kingdoms shivered violently. The Eternal Night maidens moved silently, their expressions all indifferent, like a group of black-clad wandering spirits. In the center, still, was the black palanquin²⁶. Even upon stepping onto this Eden Cloud summit, Wuming Divine Venerable remained seated within it, never showing her true face, as had always been the case. And the Abyss Emperor never took issue with it. The various Divine Venerables naturally bothered not to care or comment. But this time, almost in the same instant, the gazes of the six Great Divine Venerables—Jueluo²⁷, Huaxin²⁸, Wumeng²⁹, Tianxing³⁰, Qiongyue³¹, and Qiheng—all focused on the woman to the right of the palanquin. The same was true for the powerful experts of the various Divine Kingdoms, and along with their abruptly shifting gazes, varying degrees of astonishment erupted.

To the right of the palanquin, that had always been the position of the Eternal Night Divine Maiden. Twenty years ago, the former Eternal Night Divine Maiden, Shen Wuqing³², was deposed, and the successor Divine Maiden was named Shen Wuyi³³. This matter was known to all kingdoms. However, no one had ever personally seen this successor Divine Maiden, and news about her was very scarce. And these already few rumors were extraordinarily exaggerated and bizarre, making them unbelievable, almost instantly recognizable as false. Rumor had it that the former Divine Maiden, Shen Wuqing, had been executed in recent years... this rumor was highly likely to be true. Rumor had it that Shen Wuyi was found by Wuming Divine Venerable in an external branch of the Shen Wu lineage³⁴. When found, she was only half a jiazi old, yet already at the peak of the Divine Master Realm... Rumor had it that Shen Wuyi took less than three years to cross the half-step Divine Annihilation Realm and directly achieve the Half-God stage... Rumor had it that the current Shen Wuyi's cultivation had already reached Divine Annihilation Realm, fifth level... The earliest group of people who knew about Shen Wuyi's origins had all been silenced by Shen Wu Yanye³⁵, for unknown reasons. The only thing that could be confirmed was that on her way back to the divine palace with Shen Wu Yanye, Shen Wuyi was touched by an intelligence agent from a certain Divine Kingdom, and her cultivation was indeed at the peak of the Divine Master Realm.

But such cultivation at only half a jiazi of age... that was absolutely impossible. To cross the half-step Divine Annihilation Realm and four and a half small realms of the Half-God stage to reach Divine Annihilation Realm, fifth level, in just twenty years, was even more of a fantasy, so exaggerated that even tall tales wouldn't dare to be so absurd. But... at this moment, this Eternal Night Divine Maiden, who had finally appeared before people, hidden deeply by Shen Wu Yanye for twenty years, her profound aura... Divine Annihilation Realm... sixth level!

"Divine Annihilation sixth level... This... how is this possible?" Meng Xuanji³⁶, the Master of Xuanji Hall, who commanded the largest intelligence network in the Dreamweaving Divine Kingdom, murmured in a daze.

"Wh-what!?" Meng Jianxi exclaimed in shock. Not long ago, Meng Jianxi routinely summarized intelligence on various God Children and Divine Maidens for Yun Che. When mentioning the Eternal Night Divine Maiden, he jokingly said that rumors suggested her cultivation might have reached Divine Annihilation Realm, fifth level. He clearly remembered the twitch at the corner of his mouth when he received this intelligence, and he spoke to Yun Che in a teasing tone, even self-deprecating that Xuanji Hall's intelligence capabilities could sometimes be frustrating. Yet, he never dreamed that the Eternal Night Divine Maiden standing in sight at this moment would be even more astonishing than those exaggerated and ridiculous rumors.

"Could it be that the intelligence about her peak Divine Master Realm cultivation back then... was false?" he unconsciously murmured, as if only this could convince him to accept it. And in his daze, he had no time to notice Yun Che's strange silence, and his completely unfocused eyes.

He stared blankly at the black-clad woman. The surrounding sounds grew more and more distant, all colors silently faded, distorted, and vanished... The world gradually turned into a chaotic pallor, leaving only that pair of eyes reflected from his pupils into his soul sea. Those eyes were once the peerless beauty that broke into his life, the most sorrowful and painful tear in his soul, the eternal dream that haunted his soul... and his endless craving for a miracle and extravagant hope. Just like that, suddenly, without warning, they reappeared in his eyes, in his life.

However, those eyes were now as cold and indifferent as a deep pool, and upon contact, they did not create the slightest ripple, nor did they reflect his image. Is it her... is it not her... He felt an unprecedented loss of control over his body, and an even greater loss of control over his consciousness, which drifted away.

"Yun Che... Yun Che! What's wrong with you?! Calm your mind, focus your spirit!! You must never show any weakness!" Li Shuo's³⁷ voice echoed in his soul sea, each word more urgent than the last. Her emotional expression was becoming increasingly clear. But this time, it failed to calm the turbulent waves in his soul sea. She had never seen Yun Che in such a soul state. It was as if he had suddenly floated out of a too-fantastical dream. His reason wanted him to wake up, yet his desire feared the dream bursting like a bubble...

"Hmph!"

Pan Yusheng³⁸ concealed the unusual glint in his eyes and let out a faint snort: "Wuming Divine Venerable painstakingly hid her for twenty years, apparently preparing a big surprise for us. She truly went to great lengths."

"Surprise, heh! Do you rotten men even deserve it?!" The harsh voice from the palanquin made the faces of the juniors contort in pain, almost reaching out to cover their ears.

"Wuyi, let the world remember your appearance and name today! And let them... never forget!" Wuming Divine Venerable's voice cut through everyone's soul strings... especially those juniors who were seeing Wuming Divine Venerable for the first time. They were mentally prepared, yet still couldn't believe that a person's voice could be so terrifying.

"Yes, Mother God³⁹." Meeting the varied gazes of the crowd, Shen Wuyi slowly stepped forward. As she stopped, the black veil on her face silently fell.

"Shen Wuyi of the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom, it is my first time meeting all the Divine Venerables and seniors of the Divine Kingdoms. I hope you will not hesitate to offer guidance." The true face of the Eternal Night Divine Maiden entered their eyes, instantly eliciting gasps. Boom—Yun Che's world shattered as if billions of stars exploded simultaneously.

The maidens of the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom could only wear the simplest and plainest black clothes, without any adornments or makeup. Because in Wuming Divine Venerable's eyes, elaborate clothing and makeup were all tricks to please men! How could Wuming Divine Venerable allow it, how could she tolerate it!! Light clouds spread like frost, cascading over the dark sleeves and skirt, creating a shimmering layer of fragmented silver light. Although the black clothes were so plain and unadorned, even crude, at this moment they appeared so enchanting and noble.

Because their owner was as beautiful as an immortal painting illuminated by divine light, so stunningly beautiful it defied belief. Pure clouds seemed drawn to her, lightly brushing past her icy, jade-like neck. Every inch of her skin seemed to glow faintly, each strand more translucent than moonlight. Her eyes, beautiful as shattered starlight in glazed glass, yet so cold and ethereal, like a cold pool reflecting a solitary moon, remained utterly unruffled even when facing a host of Divine Venerables. She wore no makeup, yet her lips were a delicate cherry pink that no amount of luxurious rouge could replicate, like a splash of crimson on snow, striking the heart and soul at first glance, but they were also pursed in aloof indifference.

"So... beautiful..." This was a soft murmur from Hua Caili⁴⁰. She stared blankly, dressed in black, yet like an ice fairy under the moon, breathtakingly beautiful and impossibly distant.

"Such a woman... exists in this world..." Cha Xing⁴¹ muttered. The arrogance of a God Child made him desperately try to avert his gaze, but with a twitch of his eye, he utterly failed. Gulp!

Gulp! The sounds of throats swallowing rose and fell, and even the gazes of the Great Divine Venerables showed momentary stupefaction, let alone those young juniors. Before today, they would never have believed that in this world, there existed a woman whose beauty could rival the Sky-Breaking Divine Maiden⁴².

Even more unbelievable, she came from the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom. No one doubted that even without any cultivation, her mere appearance could captivate the entire Abyss World.

Meng Kongchan⁴³ withdrew his gaze and said to Yun Che, "Yuan'er, this woman's beauty is surprisingly not inferior to Caili's. However, she is ultimately a daughter of Eternal Night, and you must not be swayed by her appearance..."

Before he finished speaking, he suddenly sensed something and sharply turned to look at Yun Che. Only then did he realize that Yun Che's pupils had dilated so much they almost covered his entire eye. His aura, soul aura, and body... all were violently fluctuating, almost on the verge of chaotic collapse.

He instantly moved to Yun Che's side and urgently asked, "Yuan'er, what's wrong with you?"

"..."

Yun Che exhaled a difficult breath, then reached out and grabbed Meng Kongchan's wrist: "Senior, I need a barrier... ten breaths... twenty breaths will do."

Startled for a moment, Meng Kongchan did not ask another word. He flipped his hand, and a barrier from a True God⁴⁴ enveloped Yun Che, completely isolating him from everything inside and out.
