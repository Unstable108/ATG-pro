"Your state of mind is already in turmoil..." Li Suo issued a reminder.
 
"Mn."
 
Yun Che did not deny it. "I cannot help but wonder exactly what has happened to her during these years in the Abyss."
 
Li Suo sighed lightly. "I know too little about her. But regarding the Glazed Glass Woman... as I stated previously, although she can condense Glazed Glass Ice, she is completely devoid of the crystalline aura that a Glazed Glass Woman ought to possess. At the very least, the Glazed Glass Women in my memories would never possess an emotion such as 'indifference'."
 
"But these anomalies are not answers that can be found by probing at this moment. Moreover... you just gave rise to a flicker of killing intent, and Meng Kongchan was right beside you. If not for everyone's attention being concentrated on Shenwu Yi and Shenwu Yanye, there is a high probability he would have sensed it... Since entering the Abyss, this is the first time you have shown such a lapse."
 
"Rest assured," Yun Che said. "Even if I were discovered, I have a multitude of excuses I can use to smooth it over."
 
Speaking to this point, he once again calmed his state of mind, no longer attempting to argue forcefully or make up justifications, and admitted, "Alright, you are right. Today, I was indeed somewhat... disgraceful."
 
"Not disgraceful. On the contrary, the 'you' of today is more like Yun Che, rather than the 'Emperor Yun' whom you must forcefully remind yourself to be countless times every day."
 
Li Suo's voice remained as soft as celestial clouds, no different from usual, yet it caused Yun Che to be briefly stunned, followed by a shake of his head and a helpless laugh.
 
"Your words are actually quite heartwarming; they should be very effective for coaxing a young woman who has not yet stepped deeply into the world. What a pity... given what I shoulder, to indulge in my true self in this world is an unforgivable, capital sin. I will be more introspective."
 
Li Suo fell silent for a good while before speaking again. "There is one more matter I need to remind you of. While you were gazing at Shenwu Yi, Hua Caili has been gazing at you."
 
Yun Che's heart missed a beat... *Bad!*
 
No matter how repeatedly Yun Che introspected, no matter how firmly he guarded the defenses of his heart, he was ultimately not a soulless Abyssal Beast. In this world, there were always things that could cause a void to appear in his will... such as Xia Qingyue.
 
But fortunately, Hua Caili's disposition was far too pure. To Yun Che, she was the easiest sort of person to handle in the Abyss.
 
He closed his eyes for a brief moment, seemingly pondering something, and then suddenly opened them. His line of sight immediately—as if by instinct—turned toward Hua Caili's location, colliding exactly with her gaze.
 
Hua Caili's eyes were veiled in a faint, hazy mist, refracting the young girl's chaotic, unspeakable emotions and hesitation.
 
Yun Che blinked slightly, and the corners of his mouth tilted upward ever so faintly. Then, his line of sight naturally shifted away, looking toward the direction of Dian Jiuzhi.
 
It was only a fleeting glance and a shallow smile, yet it caused the tumultuous currents winding through Hua Caili's heart to involuntarily disperse. The icy mist within her beautiful eyes melted away, returning them to the flawlessness of bright stars.
 
Hua Qingying, who had been perceiving the changes in Hua Caili's mood the whole time, turned her beautiful eyes and only then whispered, "The anomalies Shenwu Yi presented are too shocking to the world. Neither I nor your Father God could keep our hearts from trembling. That Yun Che would fix his eyes upon her is truly as normal as can be; there is no need to be so sensitive or mindful of it."
 
Caught off guard and having her thoughts exposed, Hua Caili's snowy face flushed slightly, and she hurriedly refuted, "Wh... What? Big Brother Yun treats me... I know best, I didn't take it to heart or anything. Auntie, you're speaking nonsense."
 
"...It seems my perception was in error."
 
"Exactly!"
 
"..."
 
Beside them, Hua Fuchen shook his head with a suppressed laugh. The corner of his eye caught sight of Dian Luohou, who was currently dispelling the cold energy for Dian Jiuzhi, and he sighed inwardly once more.
 
As the Foremost Divine Regent of the six Kingdoms of God, Dian Luohou's Boundless power was incredibly mighty. At this moment, the cold energy on Dian Jiuzhi's body had been fully dispelled. Although his face was still somewhat pale, he had barely managed to recover his ability to move. With Dian Jiuzhi's cultivation, it would not take too long to recover his frostbitten body, but right now he was still being carefully supported by Dian Sansi.
 
And just then, Dian Sansi suddenly felt a line of sight stabbing toward him like a needle. This gaze did not conceal its aggression in the slightest, and furthermore, it did not mind at all... or rather, it should be said that it deliberately wanted him to notice.
 
As the second strongest of the Boundless Kingdom of God's younger generation, second only to Dian Jiuzhi, how could Dian Sansi tolerate such provocation? His gaze instantly turned sharp, shooting back along the source of the stare, colliding with Yun Che's gaze in mid-air.
 
Yun Che narrowed his eyes slightly, and the corners of his mouth moved almost imperceptibly. Then, he very lackadaisically shifted his gaze away.
 
Dian Sansi's hands abruptly tightened... He saw the mockery in Yun Che's eyes clearly, and even more clearly saw the words his mouth formed without sound: *Tra... sh...*
 
Dian Jiuzhi was currently frail after his injury and felt intense pain from Dian Sansi's fingers tightening their grip. He looked sideways and asked, "Sansi, what is it?"
 
Dian Sansi hurriedly loosened his fingers and forced a smile. "Nothing, just... just... I am truly unwilling to accept this."
 
Speaking the last few words, he was already unable to control the gritting of his teeth.
 
Dian Jiuzhi, however, thought that what Dian Sansi was unwilling to accept was his defeat. Instead, he smiled and comforted him, "My skill was inferior to others, so I should accept this defeat. As for the verbal insults... that was the Lightless Divine Regent. There is no need to take it to heart."
 
Dian Sansi opened his mouth... Upon the Pure Land, before the Abyssal Monarch, with all the Regents present, he could not explain.
 
But that heart-stabbing gaze assaulted him once again.
 
Dian Sansi's eyes condensed with hostility, his gaze shooting straight at Yun Che. But facing this terrifying stare, Yun Che was not only not startled or afraid, but the corners of his mouth actually split open into a wider arc... Although there was no sound and no words, that contempt, ridicule, and disdain... blasted straight into the depths of his soul like a surging tide.
 
*Look, I snatched Hua Caili who had a marriage contract with Dian Jiuzhi, yet Dian Jiuzhi doesn't even dare to flare up... Trash!*
 
*Look, the so-called Foremost Divine Son was beaten into a 'frozen dead dog'... Trash!*
 
*Look, you who know everything, yet you don't even dare to let out a fart... Trash!*
 
*The Foremost Divine Son, hahahaha... in my eyes, he is just a colossal joke! The number one spineless wretch of the Kingdoms of God!*
 
*You are raging incompetently... Oh, trash like you, like all of you, can only seethe in impotent rage! You aren't even as good as a wild dog that can still bark!*
 
...Bursts of darkness blackened Dian Sansi's vision.
 
Although it was only a moment of eye contact, that gaze coming from Yun Che was simply too piercing to the soul, too mocking... It wasn't even a gaze looking down on a weakling, but more like pitying a sorrowful, pathetic bedbug... The fire of hatred that had always been coiled in his heart, which he had nearly exhausted his entire will to firmly suppress, was agitated to the point of almost boiling over again.
 
"Mn?" Dian Luohou suddenly looked sideways, glancing at Dian Sansi whose aura was obviously disordered.
 
Dian Sansi took a massive breath of air and lowered his head. "Father God, there has never been anyone who dared to humiliate Brother Jiuzhi like this. I... I truly..."
 
Dian Luohou withdrew his gaze and said in a deep voice, "The defeated should possess the self-awareness of the defeated. If you are unwilling, then take this as encouragement to repay it tenfold in the future. As for that madwoman from Eternal Night, there is no need to pay her any heed."
 
Dian Sansi gave an affirmative response, then kept his head lowered for a long time, speaking no further. Only his jaw was clenched deadly tight, unable to relax.
 
*Why... on what grounds... My Boundless Kingdom of God is clearly the strongest Kingdom of God... Even though Brother Jiuzhi was defeated, he was once the Foremost Divine Son... He clearly has no faults... Clearly, it is he who is being tolerant, he who is forbearing, he who is considering the overall situation... Clearly, that was a marriage contract personally bestowed by the Abyssal Monarch... Clearly, the fault lies with Yun Che, with Hua Caili, with the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God and the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God... Why is it Brother Jiuzhi, why is it us who suffer this humiliation...*
 
*Cr... ack...* He faintly heard the sound of cracks appearing in his own teeth.
 
At this moment, Shenwu Yi's figure had already returned to the center of the barrier, but for a long time, no one challenged her.
 
Her eyes, like the cold pools of a dark night, fell straight onto the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God.
 
"Dreamweaver Divine Son Meng Jianxi, please grant me instruction."
 
In a scene that was only natural, Meng Jianxi was neither startled nor flustered. He stepped forward, his voice clear and frank, "Although this humble one has always prided himself on being extraordinary, in a contest of the same realm, I am absolutely not the opponent of the Boundless Divine Son. Thus, it is even less possible for me to be the opponent of the Eternal Night Divine Daughter."
 
"Therefore, this humble one can only shamelessly admit defeat."
 
Meng Jianxi's response truly surprised no one. That unsolvable Exquisite Profound Realm, that strange ice that overturned common sense... not accepting the battle was actually the most rational choice, and one that would not attract ridicule.
 
"Hahahahahaha!"
 
That extremely ear-piercing laughter also sounded without surprise. "This is the Divine Son of the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God? To actually not even have the guts to accept a battle. Are you preparing to hand over the next generation of these Kingdoms of God to this flock of useless trash?"
 
Meng Kongchan spoke indifferently, "To speak such words of humiliation to a junior in public with the status of a Divine Regent, one must say... you are truly worthy of being the Lightless Divine Regent! Presumably, under the guidance of the Lightless Divine Regent, the Eternal Night Kingdom of God must be flourishing and vigorous, with all spirits joyous and proud."
 
Shenwu Yanye let out a cold laugh. "A Kingdom of God where even the dreams are rotten and foul, a God Bearer who dares not even accept a battle. Your Dreamweaver Kingdom of God is only fit to prostrate beneath the feet of my Eternal Night in the future; what qualifications do you have to comment on my Eternal Night Kingdom of God!"
 
Meng Kongchan gave a faint, cold snort and did not respond again, nor was he angry in the slightest.
 
Since Meng Jianxi chose to directly admit defeat, the only Kingdom of God that had not entered the arena was Heaven Breaker. Just as everyone thought that Hua Caili would also choose to avoid battle, they saw a beam of clear, beautiful white light sweep past, and the young girl's figure had already fluttered into the barrier, directly facing Shenwu Yi.
 
"..."
 
Hua Fuchen subconsciously raised his hand.
 
"Let her try."
 
Hua Qingying, however, spoke faintly, "Caili's sword is sufficient to deal with the Exquisite Profound Realm."
 
Hua Fuchen frowned slightly, then suddenly seemed to think of something, his eyes revealing an astonishment that was hard to conceal. "Are you saying that Caili, she..."
 
Meeting Hua Fuchen's clearly turbulent gaze, Hua Qingying nodded slightly. "This was originally a surprise she prepared to give you, and also a trump card she strove to master to use to beg a reward from the Abyssal Monarch."
 
She suddenly sighed faintly, looking at the two people within the barrier, speaking with a touch of regret, "She originally had a near-absolute assurance of defeating Dian Jiuzhi in the same realm. It is just unexpected that such a dazzling and strange Eternal Night Divine Daughter would appear; Caili is already destined to be unable to fulfill her wish."
 
"Since she is destined to be unable to fulfill her wish, why still..."
 
Hua Fuchen stopped halfway, having already understood. He let out a sigh that was half amused and half helpless. "In the end, it is still the whims of a little girl."
 
"Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter, Hua Caili. This is our first time meeting, please grant me instruction!"
 
In the center of the barrier, the two women faced each other head-on across a distance of a hundred paces. Although they had not yet exchanged blows, they had already caused the entire venue to hold its breath in a daze; even the light breeze and thin clouds stopped for them.
 
Shenwu Yi was dressed entirely in black like ink, and between the drooping of her sleeves and hem, there seemed to be a cold mist lingering. The battle with Dian Jiuzhi had caused her hair to be slightly messy; a few strands of broken hair hung down by her cheeks, yet this only set off that peerless face to be even more jade-white and translucent.
 
Her eyes were like the condensed ice of a cold pool, beautiful as a celestial dream, yet without a distinct shred of softness or charm, containing only an indifference that rejected people from a thousand miles away. The Glazed Glass Ice aura slowly circulating around her whole body endowed her with a halo that was holy yet aloof, making her seem like a goddess of Ice and snow banished from the Nine Heavens, her beauty biting and solitary.
 
Hua Caili was dressed in snowy white cloud raiment unique to the Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter. Embroidered upon her skirt were seven distinct types of sword brilliance, interwoven with the complex and magnificent divine patterns of the stars. Tianshu, Tianxuan, Tianji, Tianquan, Yuheng, Kaiyang, Yaoguang... the Seven Stars shone in unison, symbolizing the Seven Sword Sovereigns of Heaven Breaker circling the moon, and even more so hiding a guardianship that would never be severed. When she moved her body, her skirt swayed, instantly appearing like a galaxy pouring down, flowing with light and iridescent colors.
[TN: These names (Tianshu, Tianxuan, etc.) correspond to the seven stars of the Big Dipper (Northern Dipper) in traditional Chinese astronomy.]
 
Her appearance was a heaven-bestowed treasure whose fame had long since spread throughout the entire the Abyss, known to all.
 
Her skin was lustrous white like that of a jade, her cheeks naturally blooming with a faint rosy dawn, as if she had never been stained by half a speck of the Abyss dust of the Endless Fog or the turbid dust of the mortal world. Her brows were curved and shallow like the newly risen crescent moon, and her beautiful eyes still refracted the brightest stars of the Abyss, carrying a fragile purity unique to a maiden.
 
Two peerless beauties, equally stunning to the world yet with temperaments that were completely distinct, appeared in the same field of vision. This was a beautiful and enchanting scroll painting that no one, from the top to the bottom of the six Kingdoms of God, had ever had the fortune to witness.
 
Outside the barrier, gazes were either dazed, or infatuated and unaware, or forcefully maintaining their composure... but the sounds of overlapping breathing were so low as to be almost inaudible, and pair after pair of eyes forgot to refract the bright light, as if the heaven and earth of Eden's Crown had suddenly lost their color.
