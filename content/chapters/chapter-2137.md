The Abyss Emperor's words were like a heavenly sound shaking their souls, and the shock in everyone's hearts intensified beyond measure.

A Pure Son of Darkness... Those present were the most peak existences in the Abyss; they clearly knew what those words signified.

In the records concerning Dark Profound Energy¹, it spoke of one who could perfectly resonate with and control Dark Profound Energy... Before today, such a Pure Dark Body only existed in legends!

Throughout the entire history of the Abyss, such a being had never once appeared.

Yet now, Pan Bu Wang, this former Xiao Die God Child², who had been abandoned and even cast aside by the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom³, had unexpectedly become an unprecedented Dark Divine Miracle in the history of the Abyss, drawing the attention of even the Abyss Emperor!

Pan Yu Sheng took a step forward. This dignified Qi Heng Divine Venerable⁴'s throat was convulsing chaotically, and the corners of his mouth visibly trembled and twitched, yet for a long time, he couldn't utter a single sound.

Behind him, the expressions of the Xiao Die powerhouses could only be described as ever-changing and wonderfully splendid.

Is this a blessing from your dreams...? Is it... a premonition of your imminent return...? This must be foretelling... that the Eternal Pure Land... is the ultimate destination that ends all dream abysses...

"Pan Bu Wang," the Abyss Emperor spoke, his voice still as gentle, "I have heard a little about your situation, and I also feel your sorrow and pain. Perhaps it is your extraordinary talent, or perhaps it is the profound darkness and despair that gave birth to the dark miracle within you."

He didn't ask when or in what realm Pan Bu Wang had achieved such perfect dark resonance. Perhaps the answer wasn't important, or perhaps he simply didn't want to hear a reply that didn't align with his own thoughts.

"You have allowed my long-cherished wish to be realized, and I am very pleased. Thus, I can grant you one wish. Whatever unfulfilled desire you have, or whatever you seek, you may speak it to me. As long as it does not harm heavenly harmony⁵, I will grant it."

Yun Che's face showed the most natural surprise and curiosity. He asked in a low voice, "Senior, what exactly is the concept of a Pure Son of Darkness?"

Meng Kong Chan replied with four words: "Unprecedented through the ages."

Yun Che's face bloomed with surprise. After a while, he whispered again, "Didn't the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom personally discard a pearl that could have illuminated its history? Oh, no, that's not right. After today, the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom's attitude towards Pan Bu Wang will surely change drastically. It seems the position of Xiao Die God Child is about to change hands again."

Meng Kong Chan, however, slowly shook his head, then lightly sighed, saying, "What a pity. The entire Xiao Die Divine Kingdom, for the sake of Pan Bu Zhuo, treated Pan Bu Wang too ruthlessly... they also cut off their own retreat."

The Abyss Emperor's gaze hadn't shifted even a bit, but if one looked closely, they would find his gaze wasn't actually fixed on Pan Bu Wang's face or eyes, but rather on the naturally flowing dark aura above his head.

So pure and unadulterated... So docile and gentle... Those wisps and strands... Pan Ming's aura...

For a moment, quiet gasps of breath rose and fell one after another.

This was a promise from the Abyss Emperor's own mouth, given publicly and actively spoken.

It was a grace and honor that countless God Children and God Daughters⁶ wouldn't dare to hope for in their entire lives.

Pan Bu Zhuo's face instantly turned pale. The already extremely complex expressions of everyone in the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom immediately became even more colorful.

They could foresee that what Pan Bu Wang most desired was undoubtedly to restore his status as the Xiao Die God Child... and to be the sole God Child.

Otherwise, why would he painstakingly come to the Pure Land through the Star Moon Divine Kingdom, and why would he betray Star Moon to contend for great face for Xiao Die...? His purpose was clear as day, and the Abyss Emperor's personal promise made all of this easily attainable.

On the other hand, with a body that could be called a dark miracle, today's proud battle achievements, and the Abyss Emperor's attention... even if his Divine Core⁷ was not as good as Pan Bu Zhuo's, who would dare say that the current Pan Bu Wang didn't have the qualifications to replace Pan Bu Zhuo?

Under everyone's gaze and the trembling eyes of the Xiao Die people, Pan Bu Wang, momentarily stunned, displayed the excitement everyone expected. His body trembled slightly, and his voice also began to shake:

"Today, I, Bu Wang, painstakingly came to the Pure Land... and didn't hesitate to display all my prowess, seeking to gain a little favor from Father God, only to ask for one thing..."

He half-turned, facing the direction where Pan Yu Sheng was.

Their gazes briefly met, then he slowly lowered his head again and said slowly, "I beg Father God... for a boon..."

Pan Yu Sheng's face was ashen. Pan Bu Zhuo's face was completely devoid of color, his body swaying slightly, already on the verge of collapse.

After he became God Child, in order to completely eliminate Pan Bu Wang, this greatest hidden danger, he had resorted to all sorts of despicable methods. Ultimately, he had successfully forced Pan Bu Wang into utter despair and even expelled him from the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom.

He never dreamed that the trouble he had clearly eliminated forever would actually have a day of complete comeback.

And once he made a comeback, the consequences he would face...

"The Everlasting Heart Knot⁸ that Mother sealed when she married Father God."

Pan Yu Sheng's expression instantly froze, his eyes faintly reflecting a moment of daze and... confusion?

Everyone in the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom stood stunned. Pan Bu Zhuo's body stopped swaying, his entire being completely frozen, as if hearing a preposterous sound from beyond the heavens.

This was a completely and utterly unexpected answer from everyone.

The Abyss Emperor's expression remained unchanged as he spoke lightly, "What you seek, is this?"

"Yes." Pan Bu Wang replied without hesitation, "I, Bu Wang, have now given up the will to die. For the long remainder of my life, I only seek something for my heart to rely on and something for my thoughts to dwell upon."

"Mother's relics... except for the Silent Night Everlasting in my hand, all were destroyed. Only that Everlasting Heart Knot from when Mother married, within it is sealed Mother's last wisp of spirit left in the world..."

Towards Pan Yu Sheng's direction, he knelt on one knee and bowed his head deeply.

"Good."

With that single faint word, the Abyss Emperor made the choice for Pan Yu Sheng.

"Yu Sheng." His gaze shifted to Qi Heng Divine Venerable. Just two short words, without giving an explicit order, yet it was already an irresistible imperial decree.

Without another word, Pan Yu Sheng reached out and delved into his personal space⁹. With a soft chime, a speck of black light appeared in his palm, which he pushed towards Pan Bu Wang.

Pan Bu Wang's body stumbled, almost falling forward on his knees, as he hastily yet carefully cupped that speck of black light in his hands.

It was a small jade knot, and at its center was tied a tiny Soul Crystal¹⁰, flickering with a faint soul light.

The Everlasting Heart Knot is used when men and women of the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom marry, to seal their soul threads together, symbolizing their hearts and souls forever bound. But in this Everlasting Heart Knot, Pan Yu Sheng's soul thread was no longer present; it was probably stripped away by him earlier... or just now.

Feeling his mother's soul aura¹¹, so faint yet so warm, Pan Bu Wang instantly burst into tears. He slowly pressed the small jade knot to his chest, his hands trembling uncontrollably and tightening, as if wanting to knead it into his own heart.

This gush of emotion in an instant genuinely infected everyone... So genuine and soul-stirring, it was impossible for there to be even a trace of pretense or falsehood.

He truly... only wanted the last wisp of his mother's soul left in the world.

"Thank you... Abyss Emperor for your grace... Thank you, Father God..."

Every word he spoke trembled, every word carried tears... Yet earlier, even when he instantly defeated two God Children, shocking the entire audience, he had shown not the slightest emotional fluctuation.

In Sha Xing's gaze, anger and humiliation had vanished, replaced by an exceptionally complex expression.

"Rise."

As the words fell, Pan Bu Wang's body was already lifted by a gentle but irresistible force.

Looking at the tear stains on Pan Bu Wang's face, he asked, "Pan Bu Wang, where do you wish to go next?"

Since the Abyss Emperor asked this, then as long as Pan Bu Wang replied that he wanted to stay in the Pure Land, he would certainly not refuse.

Pan Bu Wang clasped his hands together, holding the last warmth in the human world, and said softly, "I, Bu Wang, have already had my wish fulfilled. There is no longer any reason to disturb the Pure Land... I shall take my leave now."

He bowed deeply, his voice relieved and resolute.

"Mm." The Abyss Emperor nodded, without saying more, only offering one piece of advice: "No matter what situation you find yourself in, do not kneel to fate."

Pan Bu Wang left, walking without the slightest hesitation or reluctance.

But the soul-stirring impact he brought to everyone lingered for a long time.

"Yu Sheng," the Abyss Emperor looked forward, his distant voice spreading to the clouds, "I never wish to interfere with others' karma¹², much less intervene in others' family affairs. I only hope you... do not regret your choice."

Pan Yu Sheng bowed respectfully, "Yu Sheng has received your teaching."

Yun Che's eyes slightly lifted, and he secretly let out a sigh of relief.

As he thought, even if the Abyss Emperor had detected Pan Bu Wang's perfect Divine Core, he didn't say it.

Because that Pure Dark Body was his only reason for attention. Other things were not qualified enough for him to elaborate on.

Although revealing this "surprise" at this moment wasn't impossible, it was clearly much better to detonate it at a later time.

Within the barrier, Shen Wu Yi, in black clothes and a plain skirt, was still overflowing with immortal charm. Her divine posture, pure and exquisite, carried the aloofness of one detached from the world.

Meng Jian Xi leisurely stepped forward and said unhurriedly, "I'll go meet her."

But his arm was suddenly grabbed by Yun Che: "Watch one battle, then make a decision."

"...That's fine." Although surprised, he naturally wouldn't refute Yun Che's words.

The Xiao Die Divine Kingdom's side was still enveloped in an extremely strange atmosphere.

At this moment, the old man who had been standing behind Pan Yu Sheng finally couldn't hold back and transmitted a message¹³ to Pan Yu Sheng: "Honored One, are you truly not going to bring Bu Wang back?"

"Hmph!" Pan Yu Sheng said coldly, "He's just putting on an act. Putting on such a show, in reality, he's just waiting for us to call him back."

"First, let him hang for a while... give him two 'kezhong'¹⁴, then go look for him. He certainly won't have gone far."

At the same time, Sha Xing suddenly gritted his teeth, turned, and quickly left.

Xian Yue subconsciously reached out, but retracted her hand halfway. Wu Shen Xing frowned lightly, but also didn't call him back.

At this moment, Shen Wu Yi finally locked onto her opponent, her gaze pointing directly at the Sen Luo Divine Kingdom.

"I have long heard of the name of the First God Child, please enlighten me!"

Pan Bu Wang left Eden Cloud Peak and the Pure Land, without making any stops along the way.

His heart was filled with excitement at retrieving his mother's last relic, and also a deeper reverence for his master.

When he had not yet traveled a hundred li¹⁵ after leaving the Pure Land, an unexpected voice called out to him.

"Brother Bu Wang!"

Pan Bu Wang's figure gradually stopped. He didn't turn around, just stood with his back to Sha Xing, and spoke indifferently, "You regarded me as a friend and helped me greatly, yet I used you as a stepping stone... Given this, the name 'Brother Bu Wang' is no longer necessary."

"Brother Bu Wang." Sha Xing still called out this former address, his gaze no longer holding the anger and sarcasm from their battle, but instead showing the same sincerity as before: "I was previously consumed by anger, completely devoid of reason, and said too many words that hurt you."

Pan Bu Wang: "............"

"Now that I've regained my calm, I only now understand that everything you did wasn't to step on me to return to the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom... On the contrary, your devotion to your mother is so profound, how could you... be a heartless and ungrateful person?"

Pan Bu Wang finally turned around, but there was no emotion or sentiment in his eyes, only a cold indifference: "What do you want to say? Or rather... what do you want to prove?"

Sha Xing took a deep breath and said, "Brother Bu Wang, do you still remember how we became friends? You would injure your own clansmen to protect the common people of a living land. You would decisively bow your head and apologize to me for your own misjudgment. For the Eternal Night God Daughter (Shen Wu Qing) whom no one dared approach, only you actively stepped forward, not letting her fall into solitude."

"To be able to become friends with you, I was very happy. Your demeanor back then never faded in my heart because you lost your God Child status. I believe even more that human nature will not easily change."

"Therefore, Brother Bu Wang... no matter what, you absolutely must not abandon yourself or do something irreversible. If you need any help... even if it's a stepping stone, you can come find me again. If you... once, ten times, I am willing!"

He knew Pan Bu Wang's biggest secret... his master was the Mist Emperor.

Therefore, when Pan Bu Wang, to everyone's surprise, didn't propose returning to the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom, he vaguely sensed that Pan Bu Wang might... be plunging himself into a terrifying dark abyss.

"Heh!" Pan Bu Wang laughed, his laughter not gentle at all, but rather very harsh.

"Star God Child," he said coldly, "Have you been trampled on the head by hundreds of people in turns, pushed into the most putrid mud, for a full seven hundred 'shichen'¹⁶?"

Sha Xing was stunned.

"I have. Right in front of my mother's grave, I couldn't resist in the slightest, otherwise, they would shatter the tombstone I had just carved for my mother."

Sha Xing's lips parted and closed, his breathing became heavy, not knowing what to say.

Pan Bu Wang's lips curled into a grin, which was actually a sinister smile. He extended his pinky finger, pressing on it with the other hand, only revealing an almost imperceptible sliver: "This, among the humiliations I suffered in those years, was merely a tiny fraction."

"Why?" Sha Xing subconsciously asked, "What deep hatred did you and Pan Bu Zhuo have? After he succeeded as God Child, why did he treat you like this?"

"Good question." Pan Bu Wang's smile became even more sarcastic: "Unfortunately, the answer is none."

"And all of this was merely because... I was a hidden danger. Just like you, Star God Child, you who are accustomed to being the Star Moon God Child, can you accept suddenly losing this noble and unparalleled God Child position one day?"

Sha Xing couldn't say the word "yes."

Pan Bu Wang continued, "I was the first God Child of this generation in the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom, growing up amidst flattery and praise. I was accustomed to everything around me, thinking the world should be this way, thinking life would always continue like this. What I considered worries were cultivation bottlenecks, Father God's disappointments... How utterly foolish and ridiculous."

"As for Pan Bu Zhuo, he was the usurper. He knew what true worries were. He feared that he too would have a day of being replaced. He feared that I... would, like many historical records, awaken my Divine Core later and surpass him, even if it was just a tiny possibility."

"Therefore, he wanted to completely eradicate me, this so-called greatest hidden danger... Although he couldn't kill me, he could make me lose everything, make me have no one to rely on, and he could destroy me on a spiritual level."

"...Is it... merely this?" Sha Xing murmured in disbelief.

"Yes, merely this." Pan Bu Wang said indifferently, "Do you know why, when I defeated you and the Moon God Child, and greatly contended for face for the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom, not a single one of them could smile?"

"Because among them, either themselves or their children and descendants, too many had trampled on me to curry favor with Pan Bu Zhuo. Those so-called brothers and sisters who were once full of flattery, compliments, and adoration, their faces could change overnight into something you couldn't even dream of, heh... hehehe!"

He sneered, a bitter laugh: "However, I have to say, although Pan Bu Zhuo's methods were vicious, deserving of a thousand cuts, they were also very successful. Making it so that even if I had the qualifications to surpass him, the entire Xiao Die Divine Kingdom would not... dare to let me become God Child again, right?"

"But..."

"But," Sha Xing wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Pan Bu Wang's cold words: "Father God, who once cared for me greatly, only offered a few lukewarm reprimands for this... Later on, there weren't even reprimands... And even later, it was I who was reprimanded. The final result, you also saw. Hehe, the hundred faces of humans are truly extremely interesting."

Sha Xing: "..."

"During that most difficult period, Wu Qing was my only spiritual support. As a result, she died... Star God Child, have you experienced the feeling of your beliefs collapsing? That feeling where everything in the world turns gray... it's truly wondrous."

"Oh, sorry, I forgot. Your beloved is the Thirteenth Princess of Zhao Xing Domain. You two are in perfect harmony, extremely loving, and your wedding date also seems near. How could I utter such inauspicious words?"

Sha Xing raised his hand, but his throat felt dry and constricted.

"Do you know the powerlessness and despair of Mother being murdered, and Father knowing the culprit, yet fully protecting them? Do you know how painful it is to watch your mother's relics being destroyed one by one? Even if you were to use your Sirius¹⁷ to brutally gouge out my five organs, it wouldn't compare to that single moment..."

"Don't say it, don't say it..." Sha Xing's hands began to tremble slightly... Following Pan Bu Wang's words, for that one moment, he put himself in that situation...

He didn't even dare to think of a second moment.

Pan Bu Wang turned around, once again turning his back to Sha Xing: "Therefore, you, who are noble as a God Child, with parents and beloved safe and sound, whose greatest life upheaval was merely being injured in the Mist Sea, on what grounds do you come to comfort me?"

"And with what qualifications do you boldly claim that human nature won't easily change?"

Sha Xing's gaze was blank.

Pan Bu Wang's chest heaved for a moment. When he spoke again, his tone had become gentle: "Star God Child, fully enjoy your nobility, your innocence... May you never need to lose this innocence and kindness."

Moving a step forward, he stopped again: "One last piece of advice: don't try to get close to me again, and don't try to bind yourself with so-called 'past affections'. You shouldn't, and I'm not worthy."

Pan Bu Wang left, his speed extremely fast, disappearing into the horizon in the blink of an eye.

Sha Xing didn't give chase, standing blankly in place for a very long time.

At Eden Cloud Peak, Dian Jiu Zhi slowly stepped out. The divine posture of the First God Child drew all gazes to himself.

Including him, no one expected that someone would challenge him so quickly.

Although in a God Child battle, both sides with different cultivation levels would be balanced to the same realm.

But... as the one with the highest cultivation among contemporary God Children and the oldest, his profound dao foundation and understanding were far beyond what other God Children could compare to.

In other words, at the same realm, when he faced other God Children, he was undoubtedly in an invincible position.
