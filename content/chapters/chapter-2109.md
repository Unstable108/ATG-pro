Abyssal dust mixed with Yun Che’s soul imprint sank to the bottom of Sha Xing’s soul sea without resistance.

As Yun Che said earlier, no one in this world could perceive abyssal dust via spiritual perception except him. They could only sense if abyssal dust was impeding their energies or corrupting them.

Therefore, abyssal dust could both isolate his energies and his soul aura. Unless someone stabbed their perception straight into the inner depths of Sha Xing’s soul sea, it was impossible for anyone to perceive anything from outside, much less Sha Xing himself.

Although the Star and Moon Kingdom of God had suppressed the news regarding the Star Divine Son’s disappearance as quickly as possible, the Xuanji Hall still managed to capture it and transmit it to Yun Che as a packet of unimportant but confirmed intel. So, Yun Che began waiting for Sha Xing to show up after he deemed that the time was right.

Driven by human nature, he determined that it was only a matter of time before Sha Xing would return to the Endless Fog. In fact, there was a high chance he would return to the nightmarish place that had afflicted him with irreversible abyssal corruption.

He was right. It only took a few days of waiting for Sha Xing to enter his detection range.

Converting him into a hidden “abyssal ghost” was much easier than that Yuchi Nanxing as well.

When Sha Xing woke up, he felt that his whole body was in pain.

He opened his eyes and found himself staring into the silent, grayish world that was the Endless Fog.

I’m... still alive?

He sat up and subconsciously circulated his profound energy to control his injuries... It was at this moment his heart skipped a beat, and his eyes widened like saucers.

He swiftly inspected his own profound veins. His profound energy circulated through fifty four profound entrances and all of his divine essence, and... he could not feel any pain or impediment whatsoever.

The abyssal corruption that had invaded his profound veins had disappeared. Not one speck of it could be found. All that was left behind was some minor damage that could be treated swiftly.

For a moment, he just sat there and thought about nothing at all. He was so agitated that his body was trembling slightly, and he couldn’t shake off the feeling that this was all just a dream for a long time.

It had only been half a year since he fell to abyssal corruption, but no one, not even his other half, could understand what kind of torment his soul had gone through.

It was easily the longest, most unbearable half a year of his life.

And now, the terrible pain ravaging his whole body told him that it wasn’t a dream. That he really had been cured.

It was at this moment Sha Xing finally sensed something and looked up.

Hidden behind the abyssal fog, he saw a pair of eyes silently looking down on him.

Sha Xing opened his mouth, and it took him a long time to whisper, “Fog... Monarch...”

“The abyssal corruption is removed. You should leave now.”

The Fog Monarch had responded, but it wasn’t what he had thought the mysterious entity would say.

The memories from before he fainted rapidly surged into his head. He shook his head and tried to stand up, but his broken leg bones caused him to fall on his knees once more. Still, the pain was practically nothing compared to when his profound veins were afflicted by abyssal corruption. He immediately looked up and asked, “What... do I need to pay?”

“Pay? What, you wish to repay this monarch’s favor?”

There was no praise behind his dignified voice, only scorn. “I am the reason you living creatures get to live in this world, but when have you ever repaid that favor? How can you even begin to repay such a favor?”

Sha Xing’s lips moved, but he didn’t know what to say.

At this point, there was no one in this entire Abyss who didn’t know of the Fog Monarch’s angry words against the abyssal knights.

“This world is the world of the Abyss. I granted you the Lands of the Living and even restricted my people to the Endless Fog. Despite this, you venture into the Endless Fog repeatedly and hunt my people for your so-called trials and resources. The abyssal corruption you suffered is the retribution you deserve!”

“...” Sha Xing still had nothing to say, though his eyes were growing lost and doubtful.

“Unfortunately, this monarch ultimately can't be as ruthless as you humans. If you really feel grateful toward me, then get out of the Endless Fog and never return again.”

Sha Xing opened his mouth and asked a stupid, untimely question, “Is that... all?”

“Get lost!”

The Fog Monarch erupted, and the gray eyes in the abyssal fog disappeared into nothing.

The world returned to infinite abyssal dust. The Fog Monarch was nowhere to be found.

This time, Sha Xing was completely stunned. It would be a long time before he recovered his senses.

Before he came here, he had mentally prepared himself in every way and was resolved to die here. If he truly encountered the Fog Monarch, and if the Fog Monarch truly could cure him of abyssal corruption, he was ready to give up even half of his lifespan.

As it turned out, he did encounter the Fog Monarch, and his abyssal corruption really was cured like it was nothing. Even better, it cost him nothing at all.

Well, that wasn’t quite right. The price the Fog Monarch demanded him to pay was to get out of the Endless Fog. That was all.

Right here and now, the biggest emotion entrenched in his heart wasn’t joy, but loss and doubt. His faith and belief were shaken greatly as well.

He floated into the sky and began flying away from the Endless Fog.

It was an unbelievably smooth journey. From the start until the end, he did not encounter a single abyssal beast.

After he was out of the Endless Fog, Sha Xing looked back with greater complex feelings than ever before.

There were several great favors in life. The favor of being born to this world was one. The favor of being taught was another. And the third was the favor of being saved.

The Fog Monarch seemed scary, and yet he had done him an unimaginable favor. He did not demand any price either. He also seemed disgusted by his presence, and yet he had protected him and ensured that he left the Endless Fog safely.

Right here and now, the stunning words the Fog Monarch had said in the projection, the claims that he had created the Land of the Living and suppressed the abyssal beasts so that they would not harm the living...

It felt truer than ever before. Truer than even his massive incredulity when he first saw the projection.

“Star... Star Divine Son!”

It was at this moment a cry of shock and joy erupted from the distance. It came from a group of Star God disciples. They quickly formed a protective wall around him and voiced their concern for him.

These Star God disciples had come to the Endless Fog in search of Sha Xing knowing that their chance of success was less than finding a needle at the bottom of the sea. But the gods must be favoring them today, for they had found him before they even set foot in the Endless Fog.

Sha Xing shot the Endless Fog one last glance before relaxing his aura and nerves. Then, he let out a long sigh and commanded, “Let’s go.”

Inside the Star and Moon Divine Palace, the atmosphere was so cold that space was almost frozen solid.

“Do you realize what you have done, Sha Xing?”

At the center of the divine palace were two interconnected thrones. The throne to the right sat a man overflowing with divine light. His face was white like porcelain, and his hair was so long that it reached the waist. His facial features boasted both the ruggedness of a man and the beauty of a woman. Even his voice was gentleness with an undertone of masculinity, making it difficult to distinguish if he was male or not.

He was one of the two Divine Regents of the Star and Moon Kingdom of God, the Heavenly Star Divine Regent Wu Shenxing.

Wu Shenxing was rarely angry. It was why his normally gorgeous countenance looked so horribly twisted right now.

He couldn’t help it. After all, Sha Xing had escaped from the Star and Moon Kingdom of God and sought out the Fog Monarch alone. How could he not be angry at such disgraceful behavior and action?

On his knees, Sha Xing bowed his head deeply. “This disciple could not overcome his obsession and clung to his course despite all advice. This disciple understands that he has worried and angered the divine regents, and that his grave mistake is difficult to forgive. This disciple is willing to accept any punishment.”

He felt deeply ashamed and guilty for his actions, but he did not regret it.

Wu Shenxing stared at him for a moment. Even he must admit that his first emotion after confirming that the abyssal corruption afflicting Sha Xing really had disappeared completely was joy. The growing sense of unease only came afterward.

“Tell me,” he pushed down his anger and forced himself to stay calm, “how did you find the Fog Monarch? How did you eliminate the abyssal corruption in your profound veins? And... what price did you pay to do it?”

Sha Xing proceeded to tell the Heavenly Star Divine Regent his experience from the start until the end.

After he finished, the Heavenly Star Divine Regent was silent for a long time.

“Is that... all?”

The Heavenly Sar Divine Regent said the exact same words Sha Xing had said when he was facing the Fog Monarch.

“That is all, divine regent.” Sha Xing looked up and met Wu Shenxing’s gaze directly. “This disciple may have just committed a grave mistake, but he would not dare to breathe a single lie in your presence.”

The Heavenly Star Divine Regent fell silent for a moment longer. When he spoke up again, his voice had grown as cold as a cold star, “Tell me, what price were you going to pay originally?”

Sha Xing answered, “According to the rumors, the Fog Monarch had cured countless terminal abyssal corruptions without asking anything in return. It is pure benevolence without asking anything in return. As shameful as it is to admit it, this disciple was, at the bottom of my heart, hoping for the same outcome.”

“Of course, if the Fog Monarch did demand a price of me, this disciple would give up anything but something that would damage the Star and Moon Kingdom of God!”

“What a joke!” The Heavenly Star Divine Regent said coldly, “Is there anyone in this world who doesn’t know of the Fog Monarch’s hostility and slanderous words against the Abyssal Monarch? The Six Kingdoms of God have existed and endured only thanks to the Abyssal Monarch. You are the Divine Son of my Star and Moon Kingdom of God, and you would stoop so low as to beg the Fog Monarch to save you? Do you know how the world will view you once the news is spread; how the Pure Land will scorn us once they find out about this?!”

“This disciple is aware,” Sha Xing bowed his head again, “but this disciple’s mind and body were tormented greatly during this period. Although the abyssal corruption only existed in my body, it negatively affected Xian Yue, the Star God lineage, and even the future of the Kingdom of God. Even you had to divert away from your duties and invest much time and effort in me... all these worries kept growing endlessly in my heart, and this disciple heard that the rumored Fog Monarch was the only one who could—”

“Enough!” Wu Shenxing slapped the armrest angrily. “I know very well what kind of torment you went through. I know even more than the rumors that the Fog Monarch could cure abyssal corruption is true. Despite this, I have never considered seeking out the Fog Monarch to save you for even a moment. Are you really going to tell me that you don’t understand why?”

Sha Xing’s gaze shifted upward. “This disciple understands. In fact, this disciple’s disgraceful departure was just to pacify the defiance inside my heart. Honestly, I did not think for a moment that my wish would come true, but to my surprise... From what I can tell, the Fog Monarch is definitely not an evil being. On the contrary, he—”

“Silence!” Wu Shenxing rebuked, and his oppressive aura annihilated the words inside Sha Xing’s mouth.

Eyebrows pursed together like a sword, he said, “Listen well, Sha Xing. There is no such thing as absolute good or evil, right or wrong in this world. These concepts could be completely reversed when viewed from a different perspective.”

“And what is your perspective? The Divine Son of the Star and Moon Kingdom of God! Your immediate calling is the Star and Moon Kingdom of God, and your higher calling is the Pure Land itself!”

“There is no need for such anger, Xing.”

It was at this moment a gentle voice interrupted, and a man wearing a moon robe slowly walked into the hall.

He boasted the exact same countenance as Wu Shenxing, but due to the way he carried himself, he looked even more feminine than his twin brother. His footsteps were confident and relaxed, and the way his hips swayed as he walked did not feel disconcerting one bit despite his gender.

His voice in particular felt like a soothing wind that blew away the frigid atmosphere and the Heavenly Star Divine Regent’s anger before he knew it.

He was the second Divine Regent of the Star and Moon Kingdom of God, the Sky Moon Divine Regent Wu Shenyue.

The Star God lineage’s original surname was Xing (Star), and the Moon God lineage’s Yue (Moon). When the Star and Moon Kingdom of God was founded, and the Abyssal Monarch passed on the Star and Moon divine powers to their successors, he had bestowed them the surname Wu. It was a warning to the descendants of Star and Moon to always be united in heart and rule the Star and Moon Kingdom of God as one. Separation would not be tolerated.

That was why their original surnames were subsumed into their divine title instead. It was the same for the Divine Children.

Xian Yue was following closely behind Wu Shenyue. As he hurried forward and knelt beside Sha Xing, he secretly shot his companion a cheerful and reassuring smile.

“Did you even hear what he said, Yue?”

Wu Shenxing ranted, “In this world, there is nothing more worrying than a massive favor that demands no recompense! And Sha Xing... he actually defended the Fog Monarch!”

“I heard.” Wu Shenyue said softly, “No one can predict what the future brings, but at the very least, the current outcome is an excellent one, is it not?”

“...” Wu Shenxing did not deny that.

Wu Shenyue raised his hand and enveloped Sha Xing in a sheen of moonlight. A moment later, he withdrew it.

He said smilingly, “Not only is Sha Xing’s abyssal corruption completely gone, I do not detect any unusual aura or imprint in him. The rumors regarding the Fog Monarch all said that he never demanded compensation from the people he saved, so there is no reason to think that he is not plotting something. In that case, all we need to do is to suppress the news and forget that this ever happened. In fact... we should be glad that things have turned out this way.”

Wu Shenxing was still frowning. “You cannot possibly put those specks of dust to the Divine Son of my Star and Moon Kingdom of God on the same pedestal.”

“Perhaps, but it is likely that it makes no difference in the eyes of the Fog Monarch,” Wu Shenyue said slowly. “The reason he saved Sha Xing is probably the same reason he saved all those before: he had the ability, and he just happened to be at the right place at the right time.”

Wu Shenyue continued, “I have already ordered the men to spread the news that Sha Xing’s abyssal corruption had been removed by our combined efforts. The cost was five percent of his profound veins. However, the bond between Star and Moon originates from the Abyssal Monarch’s teaching and favor, and it is the foundation of my Star and Moon Kingdom of God has always upheld. So, Xian Yue would slow down his footsteps slightly to maintain his compatibility with Sha xing. No matter what happens in the present or the future, Star and Moon will remain united even if a greater obstacle happens to await us ahead.”

Wu Shenxing’s expression gradually relaxed as he listened to his twin. A moment of thought later, he finally said with a bit of helplessness, “So it shall be... I can only pray that my worries are unfounded.”

“Sha Xing, you will not breathe a word about the Fog Monarch! You will find a way to explain your sudden disappearance as well! You understand why!”

“I will. Don’t worry, Divine Regents,” Sha Xing bowed his head and promised.

After they stepped out of the Star and Moon Divine Palace, Xian Yue immediately asked excitedly, “What does the Fog Monarch look like, Sha Xing? Is he really just a glob of fog as the rumors say? How did you run into him?”

Sha Xing repeated what he told the Heavenly Star Divine Regent. The story was short and summarized, but it was still enough to plunge Xian Yue into long, disbelieving silence.

“Xian Yue,” Sha Xing said a little distractedly, “From what I witnessed with my own eyes, I feel that what he told to the abyssal knights was most likely real. In that case, the tale of the Abyssal Monarch creating the world at the beginning of the Abyss can only be a lie—”

“Sha Xing!!”

Xian Yue suddenly stopped in his tracks and barked out a warning.

“...” Sha Xing immediately zipped his mouth.

Eyebrows knitting, Xian Yue said in a hushed voice, “Never say that to anyone again... anyone, you get me?”

“I get you.” Sha Xing’s expression didn’t change. “You’re the only one I spoke my thoughts to. Not even the Divine Regents are privy to them.” 𝐟𝕣𝕖𝐞𝐰𝕖𝚋𝐧𝗼𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝗰𝐨𝐦

Still keeping his voice soft, Xian Yue said, “To us... or should I say, to almost everyone, where you stand is far more important than true or false, right or wrong. You and I are Divine Sons of the Star and Moon Kingdom of God. You must never... ever... allow a favor to twist your beliefs.”

“I know. Don’t worry.” Sha Xing nodded with determination. “You are the only one whom I speak my full, unfiltered thoughts to, and that is just what they are, thoughts. I am not so immature as to allow my personal thoughts to prevent me from doing what is right.”

Unfortunately, a human could control their actions and behavior, but they could never truly control the direction of their thoughts.

When a hole had suddenly appeared in the unwavering, unquestionable faith one had upheld their whole life, the hole wouldn’t just heal over time. On the contrary, it would grow bigger and bigger until what seemed like basic common sense, what felt like the purest, indisputable truths in the world, would be devoured by this hole as well.

Time passed quickly, and it was almost the third year since Yun Che had “returned” to the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God.

All six Kingdoms of God were very quiet during this period.

It was because the day of the Pure Land Meet was close.

This was the first Pure Land Meet ever; since the very first time the Abyss made contact with the “Eternal Pure Land”. Naturally, it was going to be a meeting like nothing the Abyss had ever seen.

It might even be the meeting that determined the fate and future of the Abyss.

Dian Jiuzhi, the Boundless Divine Son, had completed his secluded cultivation. Intelligence claimed that he had successfully entered the eighth level of the Divine Extinction Realm, though the Xuanji Hall expressed their massive doubts regarding this rumor.

The two Divine Sons of the Star and Moon Kingdom of God had broken through to the fourth level of the Divine Extinction Realm as well. They were currently resting and recuperating after completing one last trial at the Star and Moon Thousand Opportunities Tower. Clearly, they were planning to face the Pure Land Meet in their most optimal condition.

The Eternal Night Kingdom of God was as deathly silent as ever. It was impossible to say what they were doing.

Pan Buzhuo, the Owl Butterfly Divine Son, had long since entered the fourth level of the Divine Extinction Realm. As such, he spent the past two years solidifying his foundation. Today, he is firmly a level four Divine Extinction Realm profound practitioner, and he has made major breakthroughs in his dark devil arts as well.

Hua Caili, the Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter, still hadn’t emerged after entering the Seven Star Heaven Breaker Formation three years ago. Everyone was wondering if she would break out of the formation in time to attend the Pure Land Meet.

As for the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God, Meng Jianxi had finally broken through to the fourth level of the Divine Extinction Realm as well, though he knew very well that the eyes of the public had long since shifted away from him to “Meng Jianyuan”, the prince with perfect divine essence. This was a fact even though “Meng Jianyuan” was just a Divine Master.

Everyone was secretly paying attention to the Pure Land since the Fog Monarch emerged, but the Pure Land had never made any announcements regarding the entity. It almost felt like they were treating it as air, or they could not be bothered to acknowledge its existence. At least, that was what it felt like from an outsider’s perspective.

The Pure Land definitely wasn’t taking the Fog Monarch lightly though. After all, they had gone so far as to dispatch a knight commander to lure out the Fog Monarch and ambush him.

No one knew what the Pure Land was plotting against the Fog Monarch after that incident. At the very least, no notable incidents had happened during this period.

The Abyssal Monarch... was absent for the past years. Not a soul had seen him during this time. Like a mythical god of legends, he continued to look down on the world from the highest point of the Abyss, silent yet unmissable.

The Black Tide of Time continued to roll forward toward an uneasy future.

Soon, it was less than a month away from the Pure Land Meet.
