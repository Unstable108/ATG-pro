At the Pure Land Assembly a century ago, Meng Kongchan¹ would always be the last to arrive, dragging his feet. At that time, as the only Divine Nation among the Six Divine Nations without a divine successor, every time he faced the other Divine Venerables, he felt as though his head was bowed to the dust. After experiencing the birth and loss of Meng Jianyuan, followed by the acquired awakening of Meng Jianxi, Meng Kongchan could finally hold his head high.

But this time was completely different. Bringing his two Divine Sons, one of whom possessed a Perfect Divine Core, the Dreamless Divine Venerable, with his hands clasped behind his back, strode confidently into the Eden Cloud Summit. His eyes, which seemed to wish they could rise above his head, calmly swept across the room, only to find that none of the other five Divine Nations had arrived yet.

"Your Venerable's head is almost touching the sky," Second Palace Master Meng Chaoyang couldn't help but laugh.

Fifth Palace Master Meng Chaofeng whispered, "He's been holding in his frustration for tens of thousands of years. Now with two Divine Sons by his side, and a world-shaking Perfect Divine Core, it's only natural that he'd want to vent all that pent-up frustration from millennia."

The siblings exchanged a glance and both laughed. They could already foresee what kind of "arrogant strut" Meng Kongchan would display when facing the other Divine Venerables later. After all, Divine Venerables are still just people who bear the power of true gods.

The Dream Weaving Divine Nation was the first Divine Nation to arrive, but not the first power. In the pure white world, three figures were already waiting there early. When the Dream Weaving Divine Nation arrived, the three also stepped forward to greet them, their postures respectful.

The elder leading them smiled and said, "Hehe, it's only been a few years since we last met, yet the Dreamless Divine Venerable's divine bearing has become much more magnificent, truly enviable."

Meng Kongchan did not act arrogant and returned the greeting with a smile, "The Dragon Clan also has continuous good news. Here, I must also congratulate the Dragon Lord."

The Dragon Clan was in decline, far inferior to the Six Divine Nations. But as the only beast race in the Abyss, it held a special status. And in terms of seniority and experience, the Dragon Lord surpassed all current Divine Venerables and was qualified to be regarded as an equal by the Divine Venerables of all nations.

The two figures behind the Dragon Lord stepped half a pace forward and bowed respectfully, "Left Attendant Dragon Chixin, greets the Dreamless Divine Venerable."

"Right Attendant Dragon Qianxin, greets the Dreamless Divine Venerable."

"Chixin, Qianxin..."

Yun Che murmured these two names and sighed softly, "It seems the matter of succession is truly troubling the entire Dragon Clan."

"It has always been this way," Meng Jianxi said. "Legend has it that even the ancient Dragon Clan outside this world had difficulty producing offspring. And in the Abyss, constantly eroded by Abyss Dust, the Dragon Clan's reproductive ability has become extremely weak."

"The Dragon Lord is extremely old, so old that few people know his true name. But it wasn't until eight jiazi² ago that he finally had a dragon offspring. That is the current Young Dragon Lord of the Dragon Clan, and the sole direct descendant of the Ancestral Dragon lineage, Long Wangchu. Truly lamentable."

"However," Meng Jianxi's tone shifted, and his voice lowered again, "the Dragon Clan's strength, however, should never be underestimated. Although the Dragon Lord's cultivation is at the mid-stage of the Divine Extremity Realm, a dragon's body is incomparable to a human's. Grandfather (Meng Zangji) once said that even with his peak Divine Extremity Realm cultivation, he wasn't confident he could defeat the Dragon Lord."

"The Dragon Lord's two great Dragon Attendants, Long Chixin and Long Qianxin, are also both in the Divine Extremity Realm... However, it is an undeniable and unstoppable fact that the Dragon Clan is declining with each generation. It's hard to imagine how much further the Dragon Clan will decline after Long Wangchu succeeds as Dragon Lord." When mentioning Long Wangchu, Meng Jianxi's tone was not without disdain. Because based on the information gathered by the Xuanji Palace over the years, this Young Dragon Lord is a complete good-for-nothing³... in every aspect. Yet, this good-for-nothing is the only legitimate heir, the only choice. How tragic and laughable.

At this moment, the Dragon Lord's gaze fell upon Yun Che. "This must be the Abyss Divine Son, lost and then found by the Dream Weaving Divine Nation, who astonished the Abyss with his Perfect Divine Core."

Meng Kongchan smiled and said, "Dragon Lord's discerning eyes are like torches. This is indeed my unworthy son, Jianyuan, also known as Yun Che."

Yun Che stepped forward and said respectfully, "This junior, Yun Che, has long admired the Dragon Clan's great reputation. It is truly an honor to meet the Dragon Lord today."

Such courtesy made the Dragon Lord, who had lived through endless ages and was accustomed to bowing before Divine Nations, feel momentarily flattered.

His withered face broke into a smile, and he nodded, "With the Abyss Divine Son's demeanor and brilliance, who wouldn't be captivated at first glance?"

Meng Kongchan was quite pleased by such praise and chuckled, "This boy has only been back for a few years; he's still very young and doesn't deserve such high praise from the Dragon Lord."

The Dragon Lord said, "His bearing is like the clouds, his appearance like the stars. His Perfect Divine Core is a divine miracle bestowed by heaven. Any words of praise in this world would not be excessive when applied to the Abyss Divine Son. In comparison, my useless..."

He paused, his smile turned bitter, and he shook his head, "Let's not mention it."

Meng Kongchan politely said, "Dragon Lord, what are you saying? Although I haven't had the leisure to visit the Ancestral Dragon Mountain Range these past years, I am well aware that the Young Dragon Lord has made rapid progress in recent years. It must be a sudden enlightenment, a culmination of long-term efforts, with limitless potential for the future."

"Hehe."

The Dragon Lord smiled faintly, silently concealing the hint of awkwardness in his eyes. "To receive such words from the Dreamless Divine Venerable, I am truly ashamed."

His "shame" sounded like mere politeness to others. But to Long Chixin and Long Qianxin, it carried a completely different meaning.

"It's truly rare for the Dreamless Divine Venerable to arrive so early." A voice tinged with mockery rang out. In an instant, the pure white world was imbued with divine light once more. Starlight and moonlight seemed to sweep down from beyond the heavens, interweaving and reflecting each other, like a woven dream of stars and moon. Two figures, cloaked in divine radiance and identical in every way, emerged from the starlight and moonlight.

They had completely identical physiques and facial features. Even their cloud-treading steps, changes in aura, and the shifting of their gazes were exactly alike, like reflections in a mirror. The aura they carried was all too familiar to Yun Che: the power of the Star God and Moon God! Their identities were also immediately apparent: the twin true gods of the Star Moon Divine Nation, Heavenly Star Divine Venerable Wu Shenxing, and Sky Moon Divine Venerable Wu Shenyue!

"The Perfect Divine Core bestowed upon Dream Weaving is truly enviable. The Dreamless Divine Venerable's divine bearing has also naturally been renewed."

As Wu Shenyue spoke, the identities of the two Divine Venerables became instantly clear. Just as rumored, it was clearly a male voice, yet it carried a femininity that surpassed that of women, an almost bone-chilling softness.

"What's wrong?" Meng Kongchan turned around and said with a smile, "After being stared at with pitying eyes by you for over ten thousand years, can't I finally raise my eyebrows and let out a breath of relief⁴?"

"Hahahahaha!"

Wu Shenxing let out a hearty laugh, but his gaze fell upon Yun Che. He then praised without reservation, "What a remarkable Abyss Divine Son! Newly returned to the Divine Nation, with Divine Master cultivation, yet so composed and fearless. Even his appearance... is not only not inferior to the rumors, but even surpasses them by a few points. In a few more years, once he fully matures, the title of 'First Divine Son' might very well change hands."

Yun Che quickly stepped forward and bowed, "Yun Che of Dream Weaving greets Heavenly Star Divine Venerable and Sky Moon Divine Venerable. This junior is extremely humbled by Heavenly Star Divine Venerable's praise and dares not accept it."

Meng Kongchan, however, said, "A Divine Venerable's words are as heavy as ten thousand cauldrons⁵. If he says you deserve it, then you deserve it. Even that old fellow from the Palace would agree if he were here."

The pleasantries between Divine Venerables were not much different from those between ordinary people. While they spoke, the younger generation naturally exchanged greetings as well.

"Brother Yuan, these are Star Divine Son Chaxing and Moon Divine Son Xianyue," Meng Jianxi introduced them to Yun Che.

"I have long heard of the great reputation of the Star Moon Twin Jades⁶," Yun Che said. "I am Yun Che. Star Divine Son and Moon Divine Son can simply address me by this name."

As he spoke, his gaze did not turn towards Pan Buwang, who remained silent in the back corner, as if completely unaware of his presence.

Chaxing and Xianyue exchanged glances. Chaxing smiled and said, "We have heard of Abyss Divine Son's insistence. However, it would be better for us to address you as Abyss Divine Son. We hope Abyss Divine Son won't take offense."

"You two Divine Sons are too polite," Yun Che responded with a smile, keeping it brief, neither overly warm nor distant. At this moment, Meng Kongchan's gaze fell upon the clearly out-of-place figure.

"Hmm?" He raised an eyebrow slightly. "Who are you?"

Sensing the Dreamless Divine Venerable's gaze, Pan Buwang straightened up. He stepped forward and said respectfully and calmly, "This junior, Pan Buwang, greets the Dreamless Divine Venerable."

As the former Divine Son of the Owl Butterfly Divine Nation, how could Meng Kongchan not recognize him? His puzzled gaze turned to Wu Shenxing and Wu Shenyue, wondering why he had come with the Star Moon Divine Nation. Before the Star Moon Divine Venerables could speak, a cold snort came from behind.

"Hmph, the Star Moon Divine Nation is truly idle. It's one thing to take in my Owl Butterfly's abandoned son. But to even waste a spot to bring him to the Pure Land? Can I assume that you, Star Moon, are deliberately trying to make my Owl Butterfly look bad??" The light suddenly dimmed. Eternal Prayer Divine Venerable Pan Yusheng arrived silently. His demonic might was invisible, yet it made the space suddenly cold and souls tremble.

Wu Shenxing glanced sideways and chuckled faintly, "Pan Buwang may be an abandoned son to your Owl Butterfly, but to my Star Moon, he is an honored guest. When an honored guest makes a request, how could my Star Moon easily refuse?"

Bringing Pan Buwang to the Pure Land was Chaxing's request, and he was particularly insistent, so he eventually agreed.

"Eternal Prayer Divine Venerable." As if worried about a conflict between Star Moon and Owl Butterfly, Meng Kongchan quickly interjected, "Even if Buwang made a grave mistake, he is still your son after all. He was once the Divine Son of Owl Butterfly. Regardless, there's no need to be so estranged and absolute."

"Hmph, Meng Kongchan. Before meddling in my Pan family's affairs, you should first take care of your own."

Pan Yusheng glanced sideways at Yun Che and said coldly, "Don't think that just because you've obtained a Perfect Divine Core, you can get carried away. Who doesn't know that this so-called 'Abyss Divine Son' completely refused to be a Divine Son, and even rejected the name 'Meng Jianyuan,' only wishing to be addressed as 'Yun Che'?"

"A 'Divine Son' who refuses to be a Divine Son, an outsider's son who refuses to acknowledge his father. Heh, what a huge joke."

Such direct and stinging mockery did not cause the slightest trace of anger to appear on Meng Kongchan's face. Instead, his eyebrows rose high. "Eternal Prayer Divine Venerable is absolutely right; Yuan'er is indeed like that."

"During the years Yuan'er was lost, he was saved by his benefactor-master. The name Yun Che was also bestowed by his benefactor-master. Although he has returned to Dream Weaving, his lost memories have not yet recovered. Naturally, he cannot truly identify with the identity of Meng Jianyuan. What he will never forget is his benefactor-master's kindness and the name bestowed by his benefactor-master."

He looked at Pan Yusheng and said proudly, "I ask all men in this world, who does not yearn for the identity of a Divine Venerable's son? Who does not covet the name of a Divine Son? Only Yuan'er... with the ultimate pursuit of all men presented before him, yet his gratitude towards his benefactor-master cannot be shaken in the slightest! Such profound gratitude and righteousness, such character, truly makes him worthy of being a man of Dream Weaving, worthy of being my son, Meng Kongchan!"

He raised his head and looked sideways, glancing at Pan Yusheng's ashen face, and said, "However, Eternal Prayer Divine Venerable's words are quite perplexing to me. Could it be that in Eternal Prayer Divine Venerable's view, a man should decisively choose fame and profit, casting aside kindness and righteousness like worn-out shoes⁷?"

"Good! Well said! Hahahahahaha!"

The boisterous laughter directly made everyone's eardrums buzz, almost causing them to spit blood. Absolute Luo Divine Venerable Dian Luohou and Heart Painting Divine Venerable Hua Fuchen arrived side by side. Their combined divine pressure instantly dispelled the chilling aura released by Eternal Prayer Divine Venerable.

"Old Meng, when did you become so eloquent?" Dian Luohou came to Meng Kongchan's side and said boisterously, "When you used to come here, you wouldn't even say two extra words... As expected, this boy Jianyuan has brought you a lot of confidence, hahahaha!!"

His tone was unrestrained, his movements wild and untamed. There was not a shred of a Divine Venerable's dignity about him.

Meng Kongchan, whose shortcomings were exposed directly, showed no embarrassment and readily agreed, "That's natural. To say that the father gains prestige through his son⁸ is not too inappropriate."

The two Divine Venerables exchanged smiles. Pan Yusheng snorted heavily, turned his back, and said nothing more. Yun Che's gaze met Hua Caili's from afar, and then both instinctively broke contact. Like Yun Che, before arriving at the Eden Cloud Summit, Hua Caili had also received another reminder from Hua Fuchen and Hua Qingying.

With the Abyss Emperor above and the Divine Venerables at their sides, for the sake of their shared future, they had to maintain the utmost restraint and not reveal any flaws. Yun Che slowly turned his head, meeting Dian Sansi's gaze. His demeanor was calm, his eyes indifferent. But Yun Che knew all too well that hidden deep within those pupils was a hellfire fiercely suppressed by will and reason.

Yun Che's lips curved slightly, revealing a very indifferent smile. To outsiders, this was a polite smile exchanged between gazes. But it caused Dian Sansi's hands to clench suddenly. He knew all too well what kind of contempt and mockery was hidden within Yun Che's gentle and harmless smile. Yun Che's utterly humiliating and malicious words still pierced his heart and soul like countless poisonous needles. Even if he maintained his outward composure and calm aura, that soul-piercing humiliation could not truly be dispelled from his heart.

Dian Jiuzhi, however, stepped forward and smiled at Yun Che. "Brother Yun, I just heard Father God mention that you visited in person. I regretfully missed you due to an oversight, which is truly a pity and a shame. Our last conversation in Dream Weaving, Brother Yun, was very beneficial, and I felt as if we had met too late."

"After this Pure Land Assembly concludes, I will definitely visit Dream Weaving again within ten days to have a thorough discussion with Brother Yun. I wonder if Brother Yun will have the leisure?" Frankly, Dian Jiuzhi's reaction was largely beyond Yun Che's expectations. Especially his eyes... Yun Che couldn't find any deeply hidden hatred, only sincerity.

Perhaps it was hidden too deeply, or perhaps Yun Che's ability to discern hearts was still insufficient, or perhaps... He quickly smiled and said, "Brother Dian, what are you saying? If Brother Dian comes, all other matters are trivial; I will only clear a seat and await your arrival⁹."

"Tsk tsk, these two lads, when did they start calling each other brothers?" Dian Luohou said with a hearty laugh.

He grabbed Meng Kongchan with one hand and Hua Fuchen with the other. His flowing long beard framed his slightly flushed face. "The bond between us three is truly unbreakable, even if we tried to break it. Even our successors are one pair of in-laws and one pair of brothers. This is excellent, truly excellent, ho hahahaha!"

"That's natural," Hua Fuchen smiled. "The three of us swore an oath in our youth to be lifelong close friends. Regardless of our status or grievances, we must never forget this oath."

His words were sincere. However, his and Meng Kongchan's smiles were far from as unrestrained as Dian Luohou's. All five nations had arrived, with only the Eternal Night Divine Nation remaining, but no one inquired about it. While everyone was exchanging pleasantries and subtle jabs, Yun Che, however, approached the Dragon Clan, which was the most in decline and the most neglected.

"May I ask, Senior Dragon Lord, is there anyone named 'Long Jiang' within the Dragon Clan?"
