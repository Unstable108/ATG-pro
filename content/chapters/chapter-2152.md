The profound ark of the Samsara God Kingdom¹ departed from the Pure Land, becoming the first of the six great God Kingdoms to begin its journey home.

They had even abandoned an opportunity as rare as entering the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain—a clear sign of the extent of God Emperor Jue Luo’s fury.

In stark contrast to the eager atmosphere of their arrival, the return journey aboard the Samsara profound ark was shrouded in a terrifying, deathly silence. Every profound practitioner from Samsara held their breath and stifled their voices, terrified of provoking the enraged God Emperor Jue Luo in the slightest.

They could not forget the looks they received when the secret affair between Yun Che and Hua Caili was exposed... nor could they forget how those gazes had changed after Yun Che endured twice the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing with his world-shocking willpower.

The Dreamweaver and Heaven-Breaker Kingdoms, which should have been mocked and scorned, were instead met with awe and emotion. Because of Yun Che's will, Hua Caili's vow, and the deeply moving devotion between them, no one could bring themselves to reproach them any longer.

It was as if they were a match made in heaven, and people even offered blessings for their celebrated love, which had broken through so many shackles to come to fruition.

And the Samsara God Kingdom, the one that had been so clearly betrayed and wronged, was left with...

Dian Luohou stood alone at the prow of the ark, motionless for a long time, only his long beard whipping in the wind. His terrifying aura weighed down on every living being aboard the vessel like ten thousand mountains, making it almost impossible to breathe.

With footsteps that were not deliberately softened, Dian Jiuzhi² arrived behind Dian Luohou. In the distance, Dian Sansi also approached hesitantly, his eyes darting about like a frightened young animal. After a long struggle, he dared not take another step forward.

"Father God," Dian Jiuzhi began, "what's done is done. Please, quell your anger for now. This child is not qualified to judge God Emperor Huaxin or God Emperor Wumeng, but you have known them for many years. You must understand their character better than anyone. After you have calmed down, you will surely be able to judge correctly whether they intended this betrayal and harm."

Dian Luohou did not turn around. His voice was as cold as quenched ice. "What is the meaning of 'Jiuzhi'?"

Dian Jiuzhi answered calmly, "To know oneself, to know others, to know all life; to know gratitude, to know shame, to know good from evil."

"You still remember 'to know shame'!?" Dian Luohou spun around abruptly. His grim, furious voice boomed like a thunderclap, violently cutting off Dian Jiuzhi's words. "Since you know the meaning of 'shame,' how dare you have the face to make excuses for the very people who brought you shame! Has your dignity as the God Child of Samsara been eaten by a dog!?"

Meeting Dian Luohou's furious gaze, Dian Jiuzhi murmured softly, "To know shame... is to be easily trapped by shame."

Dian Luohou's eyes narrowed slightly, and his already terrifying aura took on a dreadful, sinister edge. "Who... told you that!?"

Dian Jiuzhi's state of mind was naturally far from the calm he projected. The moment that subconscious whisper escaped his lips, he regretted it. But facing Dian Luohou's gaze, he felt no fear. Instead, he answered frankly, "Yun Che."

Dian Luohou's pupils constricted. His features began to tremble, and a surge of rage turned his face crimson.

"You... you bastard!!"

Bang!!

He threw a furious punch that landed squarely on Dian Jiuzhi's face.

Dian Jiuzhi's nose broke with a sickening crack. He was sent flying backward, crashing heavily to the deck as a spray of blood erupted from his mouth and nose.

Dian Luohou pointed at him, his fingertip trembling with extreme anger. "The thousands of years of teachings I have given you... are worth less than a single flippant remark from that brat! You... you are truly something else! Truly something else!"

"Cough... cough cough..."

Dian Luohou's blow had been incredibly heavy. Dian Jiuzhi curled up in pain, even coughing up dark red fragments of his internal organs.

He propped himself up with one hand, his head bowed, and spoke in a hoarse voice, "Back then, I was even more confused and astonished than you, Father God, as to why a few short words from Yun Che could shake the principles of 'Jiuzhi' that I had adhered to for thousands of years... But it wasn't long before I understood completely."

"Because his words resonated perfectly with a truth I had always held in the depths of my heart."

The fury in Dian Luohou's eyes blazed like a wildfire. "You... what!?"

Dian Jiuzhi raised his head. Bright red blood streamed from his broken nose, but his gaze held not a trace of fear or regret. "Father God, have you ever witnessed the true nature of humanity?"

"...?" Dian Luohou's brow furrowed even deeper.

He asked again, "Father God, do you still remember my original name?"

"..." Dian Luohou did not answer, nor could he. He did not remember, nor had he ever cared.

"You don't remember. No one does." Dian Jiuzhi's voice was as placid as still, dead water. "But everyone remembers that I used to be called 'Dian Big-Head'³."

A faint, self-deprecating smile touched his blood-stained lips. "Before my Great Desolation Divine Veins awakened, my head was abnormally large. Because of that, I became an ugly monster in the eyes of others. Everyone laughed at me, bullied me, and called me 'Dian Big-Head.' Even my own birth mother despised and feared me, forbidding me from coming near her. Time and again, she screamed at me to die, because my existence brought her shame."

"From a young age, I was cautious and timid, afraid to take a single wrong step or bother anyone. I could only take the inferior resources that others disdained to snatch, huddling alone in the most wretched corner to cultivate."

"But even so, the mockery and bullying never ceased. They were my own clansmen, among them my half-siblings... I had clearly done nothing wrong. I was even trying so hard to please them."

"Yet they still mocked my appearance, stole my resources, beat me until I was covered in wounds, and then posed me in ways they found most ugly, most humiliating, most amusing."

"Even visitors from other kingdoms... we had no grievances, we didn't even know each other, but upon hearing the name 'Dian Big-Head,' they would laugh wildly and look at me as if I were a pitiful, filthy plaything."

"It was then that I learned that human malice needs no reason. Simply because of my appearance, simply because I was called 'Dian Big-Head,' I deserved to be mocked and bullied! I didn't need to have committed any sin or fault."

Dian Luohou's lips twitched, but he said nothing. How could he not have known about the things Dian Jiuzhi spoke of?

"But, after my Great Desolation Divine Veins awakened, and I transformed from 'Dian Big-Head' into Dian Jiuzhi, the God Child of Samsara..."

He let out a short, sharp laugh, filled with undisguised irony and sorrow. "All the mockery and bullying vanished. Everyone's gaze became so fervent, so fawning, so full of worship and awe... It was as if, overnight, all the wicked people in the world had disappeared, and everyone around me had become incredibly gentle and kind."

"Those who once mocked and bullied me voluntarily knelt to apologize, weeping bitter tears as if their souls had been cleansed in a single night. My birth mother, who had avoided me like a viper, suddenly became a loving parent, crying that I was her pride, crying that her past indifference and venomous words were merely trials to temper me... Heh... hehehe..."

"What are you trying to say?" Dian Luohou's voice was low and heavy, his brow furrowed. "Are you recounting your past misery? Or are you accusing the entire Samsara God Kingdom of wronging you?"

"You are already fifty-two sixty-year cycles⁴ of age! Have you not yet seen that this is the rule of the world? The strong can look down upon all life, and no one dares to provoke them, while the weak must endure the fate of being bullied! This is true in every God Kingdom, every plane of existence! With your past, you should understand this better than anyone!"

"No," Dian Jiuzhi shook his head, once again refuting his father's teachings to his face. "There was one person who showed me that one can hold a high station without scorning the lowly, and that the weak can also be respected and deserve to have dignity!"

"Cai... li."

Even though it was a love doomed to be fruitless, his voice and expression softened as he spoke her name, as if lost in a beautiful dream.

"The day I first met Caili, I was being trampled in the mud, covered in wounds, a pathetic sight. And she was the Heaven-Breaker Divine Daughter, like a divine phoenix from the nine heavens. The gap between us was greater than that between the clouds and the mud."

"But she rebuked my bullies for me and spoke words of comfort. Her gaze was not one of condescension or charity, but of genuine pity and concern. She thought 'Dian Big-Head' was my name, and when she said it, there wasn't the slightest hint of mockery."

"That day, for the first time in my life, I heard the words 'Big-Head' and felt no shame, only a warmth like a rosy dawn shining upon my heart, a warmth like a dream..."

"It was also on that day that I abandoned the death wish I had harbored for so long and began to cultivate with all my might. I wanted to see her again, even from a distance. More than that... I hoped that with this ugly body, I could temper a power that could help her, even if only by a sliver."

Dian Luohou stared at him for a long time before laughing in fury. "So, this is how you act now? Even after she broke your marriage contract, crushed your dignity, and turned you from the foremost God Child into a colossal joke, you still insist on defending her like this?"

"Yes!" Dian Jiuzhi's reply was firm and decisive.

Dian Luohou's beard bristled, and his chest heaved. He abruptly raised his hand... but facing Dian Jiuzhi's unprecedentedly resolute gaze, his palm ultimately did not fall. His voice, however, trembled with extreme rage.

"Dian Jiuzhi, do you know... from the moment you took the name 'Jiuzhi,' your life, your dignity... your everything no longer belonged to you alone! It became tied to the name 'God Child of Samsara,' linked to the fate and honor of the entire Samsara God Kingdom!"

"Look at you now! Even a dog with a broken back knows how to bark, yet you, with your spine trampled, still turn around to protect her! You... you are truly a fine son to me, Dian Luohou! You're worse than a dog!!"

Dian Luohou had thought that such a harsh reprimand, one that invoked the dignity of the God Kingdom, would at least make Dian Jiuzhi show a hint of shame or regret.

But... there was none. His words barely caused a ripple in his son's eyes.

"Father God, you were born with a nine-part godhood, born as the God Child of Samsara. The word 'honor' has accompanied you your entire life. The world knows you as straightforward and fiery-tempered... but who doesn't wish to repay kindness and avenge wrongs as they see fit? Who doesn't wish to vent their feelings freely? But not everyone is blessed with a fate like yours."

Dian Jiuzhi's voice was very calm; his emotions seemed even more tranquil than those of Dian Luohou, the God Emperor Jue Luo. "The world I have seen and felt is different from yours."

"My life was saved by Caili. My destiny was changed because of Caili. To me, she was my salvation, my savior. The radiance of humanity she showed me back then was too precious, too dazzling."

"Because of Caili, after I became the God Child of Samsara, I never took revenge on anyone who had bullied me. Because of Caili, I have never wished to show malice to anyone. Because of Caili, I have never stopped or slacked in my steps forward."

"Father God, I am not you, after all. I cannot place the entirety of the Samsara God Kingdom upon my shoulders as you do. I have things that I hold precious, and... I will never allow my status as a God Child or a God Emperor to extinguish the humanity I cherish."

Dian Luohou's hands clenched into tight fists, his knuckles cracking.

The son he thought he knew so well had become a complete stranger today.

It was only today that he realized he had never truly understood his own son.

Dian Jiuzhi's infatuation with Hua Caili was known to the world, and as his father, he knew it even more deeply. He would spare no cost to obtain things Hua Caili liked; though he was the esteemed God Child of Samsara, he never allowed women near him, and even his attendants were all male; he had mentioned more than once that Hua Caili would be the only one for him in his life, a vow he would never change even as a God Emperor.

He had been astonished, had laughed and scolded, but eventually came to accept it due to his son's persistence... because in his mind, such infatuation was merely the folly of youth. As his son's status and perspective grew, he would naturally make choices that best benefited the God Kingdom's legacy and future.

Only now did he realize with a shock that Dian Jiuzhi's feelings for Hua Caili were truly so pure that they admitted not a single speck of dust, so pure that they transcended everything in the truest sense of the word.

"You are utterly hopeless! I am... thoroughly disappointed in you!"

Dian Luohou flung his arm out, turned, and strode away in a rage, unwilling to look at him for another second.

"Cough... cough cough!"

Dian Jiuzhi clutched his chest, blood still flowing from his nose and mouth.

Dian Sansi had approached at some point. He squatted down, trembling, wanting to help Dian Jiuzhi up.

"Brother Jiuzhi, are... are you alright?" His voice was timid, and he didn't dare to meet Dian Jiuzhi's eyes.

Dian Jiuzhi looked up, then suddenly pushed himself up and slapped Dian Sansi hard across the face.

With a crisp smack, Dian Sansi fell into a sitting position on the deck. He lowered his eyes and sobbed, "I'm sorry... Brother Jiuzhi, I'm sorry. I... I don't know what came over me... It was like a devil had entered my mind... all I could think about was venting, all I could think about was ruining Yun Che's reputation... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."

Dian Jiuzhi's gaze went vacant for a moment. He reached out a trembling hand and lightly touched the red cheek he had just struck... then he abruptly reversed his hand and slapped himself hard across his own face.

"Brother Jiuzhi!" Dian Sansi cried out in alarm, hastily grabbing his wrist.

Dian Jiuzhi gave a miserable laugh, his voice desolate. "You were just an innocent party dragged into this, yet I took my anger out on you... I truly am... hopeless."

"No, no." Dian Sansi shook his head forcefully. "It's my fault. I was childish and incompetent. I didn't listen to your teachings, Brother Jiuzhi. I couldn't even control my own emotions, and that's why I made such a huge mistake. I..."

Dian Jiuzhi raised a hand and gently wiped the tears from his face, then revealed a faint smile. "Sansi, you are a man of Samsara with bones of unyielding iron. How can you still weep like a child? The future of Samsara rests on your shoulders."

Dian Sansi wiped his tears vigorously. He was about to speak when he suddenly froze, staring blankly. "Brother Jiuzhi, what... what did you say? What future of Samsara?"

Dian Jiuzhi looked at him calmly. "Do you remember why I told you I strive so relentlessly, why I yearn for the position of God Emperor?"

Dian Sansi's mouth opened, and he answered weakly, "To... be worthy of the Heaven-Breaker Divine Daughter."

"Therefore..." He smiled faintly, his gaze turning to the distant sky, where only dark clouds lingered. "My reason... no longer exists."

"Besides... you should have heard my conversation with Father God just now. My heart has long been completely filled by the light of that rosy dawn. I have no great ambition, no resolve to devote myself to Samsara, and certainly no desire to bear the future of the Samsara God Kingdom. But you, Sansi, are more suitable than I am. So, from this day forward, you must work even harder."

"No, no!" Dian Sansi shook his head. "Brother Jiuzhi, how can I compare to you? You have the only Great Desolation Divine Veins in this era, while I... my reputation is in tatters after today. How could I be worthy... how could I..."

"Sansi, remember this." Dian Jiuzhi's expression was solemn. "The least important thing in this world is the opinion and judgment of others. Because when you are strong enough, when you stand at a high enough position, all condescending looks will turn into gazes of reverence, and all mockery will turn into awe."

Coming from him, these words were more convincing than from anyone else.

He patted the shoulder of the dumbfounded Dian Sansi, then rose with some difficulty and staggered away.

Just then, a shout came from behind him. "Brother Jiuzhi, you do have a reason! Don't you want to continue protecting the Heaven-Breaker Divine Daughter!?"

Dian Jiuzhi did not turn back, but his steps halted.

Dian Sansi took a deep breath, his every word earnest. "I know that Yun Che endured twice the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing for the Heaven-Breaker Divine Daughter. It must have made you think that he will treat her with all his heart, just as you would, and never let her down. But... but..."

"I know that after today, my assessment of Yun Che will be hard for anyone to believe. It will only be seen as malicious slander and venting. But... Brother Jiuzhi, the Yun Che I saw is truly different from the one you all see!"

"When he faced me in private, his face was terrifyingly sinister, and his words were as vicious as they could be, completely different from what you all saw! It's like he wears many completely different masks."

"I've thought it over and over, and I'm starting to think that he was deliberately provoking me from the very beginning. He even told me himself that what happened in front of the Spirit Immortal Divine Abode... he and the Heaven-Breaker Divine Daughter did it on purpose because they sensed us approaching!"

"..." Dian Jiuzhi's body swayed slightly.

"I know my words are hard for you to believe, but please, you must try to believe me. Even if... even if there's just a one-in-ten-thousand chance that Yun Che really is a two-faced person who might betray or harm the Heaven-Breaker Divine Daughter in the future, at that time, wouldn't you want to have the power and status to protect her, Brother Jiuzhi?"

After a long silence, Dian Jiuzhi finally moved again, his figure gradually disappearing into the shadows of the profound ark without giving a response.
