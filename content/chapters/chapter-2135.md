Cultivation, weaponry, and even profound energy control—Sha Xing was superior to Pan Bu Wang in all aspects. Coupled with his state of overflowing rage, a single sword strike immediately suppressed Pan Bu Wang. To anyone, this was a perfectly normal situation. The might of the Desolate Fang had not yet fully dissipated when Sha Xing's sword momentum sharply shifted. The shadow of a cerulean wolf howled mournfully at the sky, its wolf eyes shining like celestial stars, unfurling a sword momentum that threatened to shatter the heavens... it was precisely the third sword of the Heavenly Wolf, "Heavenly Star's Lament"¹. Once this sword struck, its power would be like a falling star. He had full confidence that he could directly force Pan Bu Wang into defeat, after which only unwilling struggles would remain, with no chance for a counterattack or a comeback.

Pan Bu Wang, suppressed to the point where his body was slightly unbalanced, raised his arm just as the Heavenly Star sword momentum was forming. His movement showed a clear difficulty; it didn't look like a counterattack, but rather an instinctive defense of a limb facing an approaching crisis. Yet, this very arm, which seemed like the claw of a trapped beast, suddenly burst forth with dark profound light in an instant. Although it was only for a fleeting moment, this dark profound light was incredibly pure and profound, directly devouring most of the light in the space where the two of them were.

"..." Abyss Emperor², who had always been indifferent to everything, never interfering or commenting, like an outsider observing from the heavens, at this moment suddenly displayed an extremely slight, fleeting flicker in his gaze. The sky light abruptly dimmed, and an unusual aura instantly arose. Sha Xing's pupils sharply contracted, and that hand, radiating pure darkness, at this moment when he was completely caught off guard, smashed down three finger-widths below his right shoulder bone. Bang!

It wasn't a powerful explosion of force, but it directly shattered the Heavenly Star power that Sha Xing had just accumulated and was about to unleash in the next instant. That "Heavenly Star" about to erupt was utterly extinguished within his body and pupils. The severity of the consequences surpassed the tragic recoil of power.

Crack! The sound of bones breaking was like a mountain collapsing. Sha Xing's arm to his right chest was directly mangled and bloody. But even more terrifying than the physical injury was the chaotic rampage of his own profound energy as it disintegrated. He let out a muffled groan, his body flew backward, bounced high after hitting the ground, and after flying an unknown distance, he barely managed to stabilize himself with all his might. The Heavenly Wolf will and God Child³ dignity, deeply ingrained in his bones, made him cling tightly to the Heavenly Wolf Star-Holder⁴, even after suffering such an injury, without letting go.

But the light in his eyes dimmed again, revealing Pan Bu Wang's cold, profound, and close-at-hand dark pupils. Sensation had not returned to his right arm, and his internal power was in chaos. Sha Xing could barely use his sword to support himself for a moment... Smack!!

The "Silent Night Everlasting Star"⁵, wreathed in dark profound light, was fiercely swung at Sha Xing. The spear's shaft carved a dark arc, twisted with black light, in mid-air, which lingered for a long time. Sha Xing's body instantly plummeted like a remnant star from beyond the heavens. His afterimage lingered in the sky, and the sound of him tearing through the air was piercingly sharp. Upon landing, a loud crash stirred up a long-reverberating wave of sound beneath the Eden Cloud Peak⁶. Beneath the sound wave, however, was a deathly silence.

Who were the people present? At this moment, they displayed varying degrees of astonishment, even shock. Pan Bu Zhuo⁷'s eyes were wide, unaware of when the hand covering his right face had dropped. Pan Yu Sheng⁸, who had always disdained Pan Bu Wang, now stared intently at Pan Bu Wang, even unconsciously taking a step forward. As the Qi Heng Divine Venerable⁹, the person with the strongest dark profound energy in the current era, he knew better than anyone what Pan Bu Wang's momentary dark outburst just now signified.

Yun Che¹⁰ watched everything indifferently, without surprise, much less delight. For Yun Che, Sha Xing's course of action was simply too easy to predict.

"Hmph!!" Amidst a furious roar, Sha Xing sprang to his feet. He held his sword in his left arm, his gaze blood-red like a cornered wolf. The Heavenly Wolf shadow behind him displayed an unprecedentedly violent posture: "What a Pan Bu Wang, you've certainly given me... a huge surprise!!!"

Although Sha Xing, who had now recovered from the chaotic power, had a blood-stained right arm, his aura was several times more intense and terrifying than before. At this moment, a warm hand slowly grasped his arm. In that instant, it was like a basin of cold water poured over his head, quickly extinguishing his rage and awakening his reason. Only then did he realize that his current position was beside Xuan Yue¹¹, outside the barrier! Which also meant... he had lost. He had lost to Pan Bu Wang, someone he believed he could never lose to... and in just one encounter.

Xuan Yue gave Sha Xing a deep look, and her fingers gently tightened around his arm. Then she said clearly, "God Child Bu Wang's¹² wondrous move was truly astonishing. Our Star Moon¹³ is thoroughly convinced of our defeat!"

A loss is a loss. No matter how hasty or unwilling the defeat, one should accept it gracefully. This was the demeanor and dignity a God Child must possess in front of everyone.

"..." Sha Xing gritted his teeth, the wolf shadows in his eyes twisted ferociously, but he ultimately made no sound. He, the dignified Star Moon God Child, had actually been defeated by a discarded child of the Xiao Die¹⁴ in just one encounter... Ha, what a huge joke, what immense humiliation. But this was the Pure Land¹⁵, and these were the rules of the God Child Battle... What could he do, no matter how unwilling he was?

Wu Shen Xing¹⁶ and Wu Shen Yue¹⁷ exchanged glances. The astonishment in the eyes of the two Divine Venerables¹⁸ had not yet faded.

"A rather ordinary power, yet it struck with incredible precision and accuracy at Sha Xing's 'seven-inch point'¹⁹, which only appeared for an instant." Wu Shen Xing whispered, "If it was a coincidence, it was too much of one. If it wasn't... this Venerable would still prefer to believe it was a coincidence."

"Let's not jump to conclusions about whether it was a coincidence." Wu Shen Yue's eyes narrowed even further, like two beautiful and dangerous crescent moons: "If it were Pan Yu Sheng, could he make dark profound energy go from having no aura to instantly erupting?" Wu Shen Xing's response was without hesitation: "No."

Everyone in the profound way knew that controlling ordinary profound energy was like wielding a weapon; no matter how complex or heavy, with enough effort, one would eventually become proficient. However, controlling dark profound energy was like controlling a ferocious beast that, despite its immense power, was always struggling and rampaging, ready to bite back at any moment. But just now, Pan Bu Wang's release of darkness... was like effortlessly and smoothly controlling his own body.

"Could it be... Dark Affinity²⁰??" Behind Pan Yu Sheng, an elder from the Xiao Die clan uttered a trembling sound, lost in thought. But immediately, that voice began to deny itself: "No, that's absolutely impossible. Even previous Divine Venerables couldn't achieve it, how could he, a mere... how could it be possible!"

"Of course not. It must have been a coincidence in that instant. After all, even the most ferocious beast has moments of slumber and docility." This explanation effortlessly convinced everyone. After all, who would believe, who would dare to believe, who would be willing to believe that a dark outcast, discarded by the Xiao Die, would possess a Dark Affinity that even the Xiao Die's past Divine Venerables dared not dream of??

"Sha Xing has left the barrier, Pan Bu Wang wins!" The Grand Official²¹ coldly announced this unexpected result.

Sha Xing was still panting heavily, but he finally managed to suppress his rage, which was like an out-of-control volcano. He stared at Pan Bu Wang, gritting his teeth and saying, "Congratulations, God Child Bu Wang, for your divine might, successfully vindicating the Xiao Die God Child. Heh... hehe, now it seems... there's hope for your return. Why don't you hurry and seek... merit... and... reward!"

Pan Bu Wang, however, did not withdraw his power; his spear remained wreathed in darkness. He looked at Sha Xing: "God Child Xing²² seems to have forgotten something."

"Before our battle, you personally promised that if you lost, you would bring God Child Yue²³ with you to show me what the Star Moon Twin Jewels²⁴ are."

"..." Sha Xing's expression suddenly stiffened. Xuan Yue, however, was neither surprised nor annoyed, displaying a smile: "Of course, we haven't forgotten. Our Star Moon Divine Kingdom²⁵ has always valued promises highly, and the Star Moon God Children have always been united as one, inseparable. Sha Xing's promise is Xuan Yue's promise."

"Since our side has lost, we will act according to our promise." Sha Xing looked at Xuan Yue. The moment their gazes met, they understood each other without needing to speak. He silently apologized to Xuan Yue, who in turn told him there was no need to apologize. The two Star Moon Gods shared the same inherited artifact, which led to the birth of the Star Moon Twin Jewels. Each generation of Twin God Children had to achieve identical divine cores, synchronized cultivation, aura, and even souls. Under such strict compatibility, the two complemented each other perfectly, and the power they generated was far more than simply doubled.

The two combining their powers to fight Pan Bu Wang... if they won, it would still be a defeat. But once a promise was made, it could never be regretted. The two simultaneously leaped, entering the barrier, standing side-by-side facing Pan Bu Wang.

Light and shadow flowed in Xuan Yue's hand, revealing a very magnificent purple sword. The sword's blade traced an elegant crescent-moon sword mark, pointing diagonally at Pan Bu Wang: "Xuan Yue of the Star Moon Divine Kingdom, I humbly request your guidance!"

Purple mist illuminated the sky, dreamlike and ethereal. A slight ripple suddenly appeared in Shen Wu Yi²⁶'s beautiful eyes, which had always been still and lifeless. It seemed like a moment of confusion and incomprehension, but it vanished in an instant. Sha Xing remained silent, the Heavenly Wolf Star-Holder silently lowered to the ground. But the latent power, though unreleased, made all the profound practitioners outside the barrier feel a terrible sense of oppression. More terrifying than a wolf is an angry wolf. More terrifying than an angry wolf is a wounded wolf.

Their stances were different, their sword intents opposing. But when they stood together, there was a subtle yet perfectly harmonious sense of unity, as if the two of them were originally one, allowing no external interference, nor even a hint of separation. Just moments ago, Pan Bu Wang's intention to fight the Star Moon Twin Jewels alone had drawn widespread laughter. But in the blink of an eye, such a scene was actually unfolding before their eyes.

Regardless of the outcome, based solely on the scene at this moment, the name "Pan Bu Wang," even if he no longer held the title of God Child, would surely resound throughout the Abyss once more.

"Tch!! An idiot is an idiot. He should have quit while he was ahead after that inexplicable victory, but he just had to 'draw legs on a snake'²⁷ and bring humiliation upon himself..." Pan Bu Zhuo muttered resentfully, then secretly turned his gaze to observe his father's reaction. He found Pan Yu Sheng's brows tightly furrowed, his eyes intensely focused, completely devoid of the anger and disgust he had anticipated.

"Do not underestimate him." The sound transmission²⁸ from Wu Shen Xing in their ears made Sha Xing and Xuan Yue both freeze for a moment.

"This Pan Bu Wang, he is very unusual... do not underestimate him." With the two of them in their combined form, the Heavenly Star Divine Venerable²⁹ actually sent a special sound transmission to warn them not to underestimate their opponent? The shock that rippled through their hearts at this moment surpassed the shock Sha Xing felt when Pan Bu Wang defeated him in a single encounter. Their state of mind, and their gazes towards Pan Bu Wang, subtly changed... and then, they completely focused their minds and spirits.

Their profound energy seamlessly merged, their breathing synchronized... They clearly perceived each other's overlapping heartbeats.

"Begin." The Grand Official said faintly. Pan Bu Wang said nothing, only gradually intensifying dark ripples flowed from his body.

…………

Bu Wang: "If I successfully defeat Sha Xing, what should this disciple do next?"
Mist Emperor³⁰: "Since God Child Xing has been defeated, then next, of course, is to continue defeating the Star Moon Twin God Children!"
Bu Wang: "...This disciple first visited the Star Moon Divine Kingdom back then and personally witnessed the power of the Star Moon Twin Jewels. This disciple... has absolutely no chance of winning."
Mist Emperor: "In a head-on confrontation, of course, you have no chance of winning. But, in your first encounter, you have a huge advantage, which is still a cognitive bias. And they have a huge disadvantage."
Bu Wang: "Disadvantage? Please enlighten me, Master."
Mist Emperor: "Their advantage is their greatest disadvantage!"
Bu Wang: "...?"
Mist Emperor: "Bu Wang, remember this one sentence. People are most undefended in the areas they are most proud of and most skilled in. What the Star Moon God Children are most powerful and proud of is their perfect combination."
"When they combine, it's as if an invisible thread connects them, seamlessly linking their auras, perceptions, and intentions, thereby generating power far exceeding what they could achieve fighting individually."
"But if... you sever this 'thread' of theirs right from the start, then the two originally powerful God Children will, in that instant, become two headless flies that have lost all their senses."
"That instant is your chance to win!"
Bu Wang: "...What should this disciple do?"
Mist Emperor: "The devouring and annihilating ability of dark profound energy is the bane of their 'combined' power. Unfortunately, the 'Pan Yuan Qi Heng Art'³¹ cultivated by your Xiao Die Divine Kingdom has enough life-devouring power, but not enough soul-devouring ability."
"Then, I will use the 'Pan Yuan Qi Heng Art' you cultivate as a foundation to create a soul-devouring profound skill for you, named 'Pan Yuan Severing Night'³²!"
"Remember, this move is for you to comprehend and create on your own!"

…………

God Child Xing and God Child Yue attacked simultaneously. The Heavenly Wolf howled in the sky, the purple moon reflected in the soul. Two distinctly different powers completely and thoroughly sealed and enveloped the space where Pan Bu Wang was, leaving no escape route within and no flaw without. Like two hands of a single person, effortlessly and naturally creating a complementary force field.

Pan Bu Wang slowly raised his head, dark light flickering on his body, seemingly activating his profound energy. But no one knew that his pupils had transformed into dark abysses, like a thousand layers of night. Boom-hum— The air currents were violently shaken open, Sha Xing's shadow already appeared overhead, the might of the Heavenly Wolf, filled with rage, crashed down... Behind the Heavenly Wolf, a purple light followed closely. After the first sword, it was the flawless combined assault of the Heavenly Wolf and the Purple Palace³³. Unless one held an absolute advantage in cultivation, they would be suppressed like being caught in an endless downpour; let alone counterattacking, even a moment's breath would be a luxury.

But the Silent Night Everlasting Star in Pan Bu Wang's hand still hadn't been raised... Until the Heavenly Wolf's sword was only ten zhang³⁴ away from him, the black light in his pupils finally deepened to its extreme. In an instant, the sky and earth darkened, the sun and moon lost their light. There was no sound, no warning; the space within the barrier transformed into complete and utter darkness. Immediately, cries of alarm rose from all around. Even in the Qi Heng Divine Venerable's eyes, an unconcealable shock appeared. Darkness reflected in Yun Che's eyes, yet it couldn't reach the bottomless abyss of his pupils. This move, taken from the "Eternal Night Without Light"³⁵ of the Eternal Night Illusionary Devil Canon³⁶, was fused with the Pan Yuan Qi Heng Art using the power of Dark Eternal Tribulation³⁷, thus becoming "Pan Yuan Severing Night." When he fused them, he also performed sufficient 'heterogenization'³⁸. This ensured that even those who knew the Eternal Night Illusionary Devil Canon would not easily connect the two.
