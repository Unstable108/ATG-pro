“From what I’ve heard, the Abyssal Emperor¹ merely issued a reasonable announcement. Why has your mood suddenly become so heavy?” Sensing an overly abnormal shift in Yun Che’s² emotions, Li Suo³ asked.

Yun Che calmed his mind and replied, “I don’t know either.”

“You don’t know?”

Yun Che thought for a moment, then said, “The Abyssal Emperor, who never pays attention to the Six Divine Nations⁴, proactively spoke today to admonish the two Divine Venerables⁵. Based on my understanding of human nature, this cannot be explained by a simple reason like ‘being in a good mood.’ I fear that hidden within this are variables beyond my comprehension and not within my calculations.”

Li Suo pondered for a long time, then said, “Still just a guess, right?”

“Right…”

“Your steps are too cautious. If you shackle yourself with every step you take, then perhaps before you reach the end, you will be crushed by the immense pressure you’ve placed upon yourself. Some unclear confusions, you might as well temporarily let them go and focus on completing what needs to be done now.”

“Mm…”

Li Suo’s words gradually relaxed Yun Che’s mood. “Alright, you’re right.”

After a while, Li Suo’s faint, ethereal immortal voice echoed in Yun Che’s Soul Sea⁶ again: “Yun Che, don’t always let yourself be so lonely, and don’t repeatedly burden your already heavy body with even heavier shackles.”

“In this world, you are no longer just an emperor burdened with the responsibility of saving the world; you are also a father and a husband. Your daughter, even if she has never walked with you, you share a bloodline connection that nothing can sever; your wife, even if she has forgotten you, the karma and past between you, even the Abyssal Dust⁷ of the Mist Sea⁸ cannot obliterate.”

“Hm?”

Yun Che raised an eyebrow, quite surprised by Li Suo’s words. “Those words sound truly touching. Could it be… that without my knowing, your benevolent divinity as the Life Creation God⁹ has quietly awakened?”

“I am merely stating a fact that we both know.”

“…Never mind.”

Yun Che’s raised eyebrow drooped back down, accompanied by his mutter, “Such a boring answer… it’s truly you.”

“Boring, you say…”

Li Suo seemed somewhat bothered by this assessment. She fell silent for a moment, then softly said, “Besides them, I will also always be with you, until the end of this path, whether it be successful or a failure.”

In the Soul Sea, Yun Che’s soft chuckle resonated.

He said, seemingly helpless and teasing, “When we return to our original world, I’ll have to spend some effort teaching you how to speak. When comforting someone, even if you know ‘failure’ exists, it shouldn’t be spoken aloud.”

“…Alright, I’ve noted it down,” Li Suo softly responded.

However, this exchange did significantly relax Yun Che’s state of mind.

“Thus, all that I wished to declare has been said.” The Abyssal Emperor’s words signaled the end of today’s assembly. It was incredibly simple and brief, yet in truth, throughout the countless eras of the Abyssal history’s Pure Land Assemblies¹⁰, the Abyssal Emperor’s words today could be considered “lengthy.” Yun Che concealed the strange glint in his eyes… The Abyssal Emperor’s words ended just like that, without a single mention of the Mist Emperor¹¹ from beginning to end. Over the years, Yun Che had painstakingly created various momentum in the Mist Sea, utilizing his unique ability to control Abyssal Dust and the information asymmetry beyond common understanding. This had largely caused the beings of the Abyss to question the Abyssal Emperor’s world-saving and world-creating deeds, and it also shook their originally supreme and flawless faith in him. Moreover, this influence was spreading and intensifying step by step.

Faith was undoubtedly the most crucial foundation. For any emperor, this was absolutely intolerable. Yet, the Abyssal Emperor did not order the Six Divine Nations to suppress it, nor did he explain away the Mist Emperor’s slander. From beginning to end, he did not mention a single word. It was as if he was completely indifferent to the Mist Emperor’s existence and everything he had caused. The Grand Divine Official¹² spoke at this moment: “Abyssal Emperor, since the last audience of this scale, there have been some changes among the Divine Inheritors¹³ of the various Divine Nations. Are you interested in observing the demeanor of the current Divine Inheritors this time?”

Aside from the Void-Breaking Ceremony¹⁴ held every fifty years, attended only by Divine Venerables and Dragon Lords, such a formal Pure Land Assembly would never be without a competition among Divine Inheritors.

“Of course.”

The Abyssal Emperor smiled faintly. His gaze did not shift, yet it seemed to slowly sweep over every Divine Inheritor. “The Divine Inheritors of this generation are not only the cornerstones of the future Divine Nations but also new buds that will bloom in the Eternal Pure Land¹⁵.”

“Your demeanor today will determine how brilliantly you will blossom in the first era of the Eternal Pure Land.”

The Abyssal Emperor, who had previously only been an observer, rarely offered such warm and precious expectations. This also ignited fighting spirit and a strange glint in the eyes of the Divine Sons¹⁶ and Divine Daughters¹⁷. Indeed, they were the first generation of Divine Sons and Divine Daughters to enter the “Eternal Pure Land,” stepping on the efforts of their predecessors for millions of years, and they would also be the first generation of overlooking Divine Venerables to be crowned in the “Eternal Pure Land”! Such fortune and glory naturally demanded the most dazzling demeanor and radiance! The Grand Divine Official received the order and nodded, taking half a step forward. His massive arm rose into the sky, then instantly swung down, and a faintly glowing barrier immediately descended from the heavens, landing in the central area of the Eden Cloud Summit¹⁸. The barrier was almost transparent, with only a faint bronze glow slowly flowing within it.

“This barrier isolates power but does not sever the body. Leaving the barrier is considered defeat.”

“The challenged can only admit defeat, not refuse to fight!”

“For those with different cultivation levels, the one with lower cultivation can request to be balanced to the same realm!”

“This battle is solely to display the demeanor of Divine Inheritors, not for contention, and absolutely no malicious intent is allowed!”

“The one with the most outstanding demeanor can have one wish granted by the Abyssal Emperor.”

The Grand Divine Official personally announced the rules, concise and to the point, every word striking the heart like a divine oracle from heaven. Basic rules such as no external interference, no external means, and no malicious heavy-handedness did not need to be mentioned, as no one dared to overstep their bounds under the Abyssal Emperor’s gaze. The barrier was less than ten thousand feet wide, surprisingly small, similar to previous years, clearly designed to quickly determine victory or defeat.

“It has begun.”

Meng Kong Chan¹⁹ whispered, “Yuan Er²⁰, you are not a Divine Son, so this battle has nothing to do with you, but watch carefully. This is your best opportunity to directly understand the Divine Inheritors of the various nations.”

“In every move and stance, what flows is not only profound energy²¹ but also their will and temperament. When you achieve minor success in the Dream Weaving Divine Canon²², you will better understand its true meaning.” On the other side, Meng Jian Xi²³ already had silver light gleaming in his eyes, eager to try.

Yun Che turned his gaze to Hua Cai Li²⁴. As if telepathically connected, Hua Cai Li’s gaze also happened to turn to him. The moment their eyes met, Yun Che instantly understood the sword intent in her eyes.

She wanted to challenge Dian Jiu Zhi²⁵! With her Divine Extinction Realm²⁶ Level 2 cultivation, she naturally couldn’t be a match for Dian Jiu Zhi, who was at Divine Extinction Realm Level 8. But in the Divine Son competition, cultivation levels needed to be balanced to the same realm. Facing Dian Jiu Zhi at the same realm, she had enough confidence and determination.

Perhaps, in her still-young heart, if she could defeat Dian Jiu Zhi, it would add a bargaining chip for her Yun Che’s future… although in Yun Che’s view, it held no practical meaning regardless of victory or defeat. And if she could become the “most outstanding demeanor” as mentioned by the Grand Divine Official, she could have one wish granted by the Abyssal Emperor. What she wanted, undoubtedly, was for the Abyssal Emperor to retract the marriage contract he had personally granted.

However, someone stepped out before her. A flash of starlight, and a tall, upright figure, stepping on the shattered shadows of star gods, stood proudly within the barrier.

“Sha Xing²⁷ of the Star Moon Divine Nation²⁸, I dare to fight first!” Boom! A deafening explosion echoed above the Eden Cloud Summit. A heavy sword, entirely pale silver and larger than his body, appeared before Sha Xing. Without any hesitation, Sha Xing raised the greatsword, pointing directly at the Owl Butterfly Divine Nation²⁹.

“Owl Butterfly Divine Son³⁰ Pan Bu Zhuo³¹, I humbly request your guidance!” Roar— The shadow of a giant wolf appeared behind Sha Xing, raising its head and howling at the sky. A profound shadow with endless might covered the Heavenly Wolf Greatsword³² with a pale blue majestic light. Pan Bu Zhuo stepped out, a black light as wild as burning flames rising from his body.

The challenged cannot refuse to fight. As a Divine Son, one can only be defeated, not retreat! With a turn of his body, he appeared within the barrier, directly facing the Star Divine Son³³.

At the same instant, behind the Star Moon Divine Nation, Pan Bu Wang³⁴ slowly raised his head, a gaze tainted with endless resentment piercing directly at Pan Bu Zhuo… But in the next instant, all emotions were completely hidden in the depths of his eyes, not a trace overflowing. The gazes of Qi Heng Divine Venerable³⁵ and Tian Xing Divine Venerable³⁶ also met.

A divine message from Qi Heng Divine Venerable directly addressed Tian Xing Divine Venerable: “As a Divine Son, to engage in such a petty dispute for a discarded son of my Owl Butterfly Nation, the Divine Inheritor meticulously cultivated by Tian Xing Divine Venerable is truly promising.”

Wu Shen Xing³⁷ replied with a faint smile: “This Venerable, however, believes that occasional emotional disputes are not inappropriate. It’s far better than raising jackals who can lay poisonous hands on their own blood relatives, don’t you agree, Qi Heng Divine Venerable?”

Pan Yu Sheng³⁸ snorted coldly, no longer responding.

“Star Moon’s Sha Xing, Owl Butterfly’s Pan Bu Zhuo, both at Divine Extinction Realm Level 4. No balancing needed, begin.” The moment the Grand Divine Official’s voice fell, Pan Bu Zhuo instantly struck, a black light like a space-tearing demonic light, piercing directly at Sha Xing.

Meng Kong Chan whispered, “The Star Divine Son cultivates the Heavenly Wolf Prison God Canon³⁹. He uses a heavy sword as his weapon, and his moves are grand and sweeping, with unparalleled might, but they are harder to control. When fighting him, one must seize the initiative and avoid his sharp edge.”

Yun Che nodded slightly, indicating he understood.

“The sword in the Star Divine Son’s hand is called Heavenly Wolf Holding Star⁴⁰, the most mighty of all Divine Son weapons in the Divine Nations; the spear in the Owl Butterfly Divine Son’s hand is called Cold Crow⁴¹, and once struck by it, darkness devours the body, sorrowful like a crow’s cry.” The dignified Wu Meng Divine Venerable⁴² patiently and extremely detailed explained to Yun Che.

Rip! Sword and spear clashed, and countless pitch-black demonic patterns bloomed in space, like thousands of demonic crows wailing, directly devouring Sha Xing’s body and soul. Even the surrounding light rapidly dimmed.

But in the next instant, the Heavenly Wolf roared, and the Heavenly Wolf divine power arrived belatedly, annihilating all the demonic patterns and demonic crows.

Boom!

A loud noise like the sky collapsing. The darkness was almost instantly swallowed by the Heavenly Wolf, as if in the first exchange of the two Divine Sons’ battle, superiority and inferiority were immediately apparent. However, Pan Bu Zhuo’s sudden spear thrust to seize the initiative was actually a feint.

The moment a slight flaw appeared as the Heavenly Wolf swallowed the demonic crows, Pan Bu Zhuo’s figure appeared above like a ghost. With his spear pointing downwards, countless spiderweb-like pitch-black demonic patterns suddenly bloomed at the spear tip.

As the black light in his pupils burst forth, thousands of pitch-black demonic crows flapped their wings and emerged from the demonic patterns. Their shrieks were piercing and ear-splitting, like the wails of lost souls and bone-eating curses, densely swarming towards Sha Xing, determined to tear apart his flesh and devour his soul.
