The High Priest's gaze shifted to the Abyssal Emperor as he sent a sound transmission, "Lord Emperor, colorless and flawless, utterly pure and clean... only the Glazed Glass Ice fits this description."

"But the Glazed Glass Ice vanished for eternity long ago, never to appear again. Is my judgment flawed?" The High Priest found himself questioning his own perception, which far surpassed that of any spirit in the current age.

The Abyssal Emperor responded, "This woman possesses both the Nine Profound Exquisite Body and the Ice Snow Glazed Heart. The Nine Profound has matured, and the Glazed has blossomed, giving rise to the Exquisite Profound Realm and the Glazed Glass Ice."

The High Priest fell silent for a long while before slowly asking, "This woman... why?"

"I do not know, nor do I need to." Faced with the world-shaking phenomenon surrounding Shen Wuyi, the Abyssal Emperor's reply was tinged with an incomprehensible indifference. The High Priest asked no more.

A person without cause... A thought surfaced, only to be faintly erased by the Abyssal Emperor, dismissed as irrelevant.

More and more people began to notice the strange icy light around Shen Wuyi. As the light refracted continuously, they finally discerned that it was an isolating barrier protecting her. It released a very faint icy aura, yet it lacked the familiar glow of ice, possessing only a colorless, formless transparency.

"Ice?"

Meng Jianxi's face was filled with confusion. "None of the profound arts of the Eternal Night Divine Nation involve the control of ice. Besides... when an icy aura is released, it should manifest as blue profound light of varying shades. How can it be completely transparent?"

Meng Kongchan did not answer, for he too had never seen such an icy aura. He was even more baffled as to how an ice barrier with such a weak presence could withstand the Great Wilderness Power of Dian Jiuzhi.

Yun Che stared at the sky, his brow deeply furrowed for a long time. Ice... is it the Ice Phoenix God Investiture Canon she cultivates?

No, it was completely different. And why was the icy aura colorless? While natural ice in the world was indeed colorless, the profound energy of ice condensed from profound arts would release a blue icy light. This was common knowledge in the profound way.

As the person most skilled in wielding the profound energy of ice in the current era, Yun Che naturally understood this best. The very term "ice blue" in the lexicon of the profound way was derived from the profound light of ice energy. In all his knowledge, experience, and even in any records he had ever seen, there was no mention of colorless profound ice.

"The Pale Flame... the Glazed Glass Ice..." A soft, distant whisper suddenly echoed in Yun Che's soul sea.

Yun Che collected his thoughts and asked, "What was that you just mentioned?"

Li Suo sorted through the fragments of memory that had just been stirred, her voice exceptionally slow and gentle. "When the Ancestral God created the world, she left behind Three Calamities and Three Blessings."

"One of the Three Calamities was the most ferocious of fires—the Pale Flame. One of the Three Blessings was the purest of waters—the Glazed Glass Ice."

Three Calamities and Three Blessings. This was a concept Yun Che had never heard of, one that did not exist in any known records. Its existence was simply too ancient, so ancient that the God and Devil races had not yet fully formed.

"One of the Three Calamities, the most ferocious of fires, could burn through the void and incinerate the bodies of gods. Its flame was pale, and anything it touched turned to ash. In the end, this calamity was extinguished by the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor, leaving only an indestructible source core."

"The Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor attempted to control it but failed. She had no choice but to shatter it with the most extreme of elemental creation god powers, breaking it into three fragments. These three fragments were bestowed by the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor upon three beast clans, known as the Vermilion Bird, the Phoenix, and the Golden Crow."

Yun Che's heart stirred... The Vermilion Bird, the Phoenix, and the Golden Crow were indeed the three great fire-system supremes renowned throughout the Era of Gods. It was no wonder these three clans held the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor in such high esteem.

"And in the primordial balance of cause and effect, opposing the most ferocious calamity was the purest blessing, the Glazed Glass Ice."

"The Glazed Glass Ice is supremely pure and clean, colorless and flawless. It was the purest substance bestowed upon the world by the Ancestral God at the time of creation, capable of reflecting and purifying all the filth and foulness of the world."

"The source of the Glazed Glass Ice is the Glazed Glass Divine Breath that roams the world. It can bless the body of a newborn girl, giving rise to an Ice Snow Glazed Heart. As she grows, she can then condense the Glazed Glass Ice."

"Such a Glazed Glass Maiden's heart can sense good and evil, her eyes can see through falsehood, and her body, soul, and aura are all untainted and flawless. The Heavenly Way draws near, wishing to grant her its protection; profound energy draws near, reluctant to cause her harm; sin draws near, and is overcome with shame..."

"But..."

Li Suo's tone shifted, tinged with regret. "This blessing from the Ancestral God vanished from the world for all eternity, even before the most ferocious calamity."

"Why?"

Li Suo explained slowly, "With the creation of the gods and the proliferation of all living things, endless evil thoughts, greed, desire, and slaughter also arose, turning into filthy dust that coated the heavens and earth layer by layer."

"This filth and grime, which even the Ancestral God could not have foreseen, sullied the world's aura layer by layer. The Glazed Glass Divine Breath, which once filled the world, was also corrupted and tainted, gradually dissipating until only faint, residual wisps remained, hidden deep within the primordial Primal Chaos Qi."

"Once the world became a sullied world, it could never return to its former state. Those blessed by the divine breath, born with an Ice Snow Glazed Heart, still appeared occasionally, but they could no longer condense the Glazed Glass Ice, and thus, there were no more true Glazed Glass Maidens. As these women grew up in the sullied world, even their Ice Snow Glazed Hearts would eventually be covered in layers of dust, and they would revert to ordinary women."

Yun Che listened quietly. Only when Li Suo's voice stopped did he ask, "Are you saying... the colorless ice she is using right now is the Glazed Glass Ice?"

Li Suo replied, "Its color, form, and aura match what I know, but there is also a great sense of incongruity."

"Incongruity in what way?"

"The ice may be the Glazed Glass Ice, but her aura is not at all that of a Glazed Glass Maiden."

Naturally, Yun Che could not fully comprehend this answer.

He asked urgently, "She does possess the only Ice Snow Glazed Heart in the current era. But didn't you say that the Glazed Glass Ice could never appear again? No matter what, the world back then couldn't have been more sullied than the Abyss."

Li Suo fell silent, searching through the still-hazy memory fragments that had recently awakened. Then, she actually gave Yun Che a rather clear answer. "Perhaps, there is one other possibility."

"The Ancestral God's sacred aura on her... and the fact that she is a person without cause."

Yun Che: "What is... without cause?"

Li Suo said, "She is no ordinary being, but the ninth living creature personally created by the Ancestral God, separate from the four Creation Gods and four Devil Emperors. The creation of the Creation Gods and Devil Emperors each had its cause, and so did hers."

"..."

Yun Che's heartstrings trembled uncontrollably for several breaths.

"The God Realm and the Abyss are two isolated worlds. When she fell into the Abyss, the causal link between you was completely severed. Coupled with the loss of her memories, her existence... lost its preceding cause."

"She became a person without cause, utterly pure, a being who should not exist within the concepts and laws of this world."

"Perhaps it is precisely this purity, which transcends concepts and laws, that allowed her Ice Snow Glazed Heart to blossom and condense the Glazed Glass Ice."

This was her speculation, and it was the only possibility she could find by piecing together all her existing knowledge at the Creation God level.

Cries of shock and doubt filled the scene, yet no one uttered the name "Glazed Glass Ice." This concept did not exist in the knowledge of the Six Divine Nations.

Dian Jiuzhi gazed up at the black immortal figure in the sky. The moment their eyes met, that inexplicable sense of inadequacy surged once more, flooding his mind like a tide.

He could only quickly avert his gaze and forcefully suppress his distracting thoughts. The silver radiance that had just subsided flared again, condensing in his hands into a giant silver bow. The bowstring was drawn into a full moon, and upon its release, a sky full of silver light arrows tore through the air. Like the Silver River¹ inverted, they enveloped the entire battlefield, leaving not a single inch of dead space.

Shen Wuyi's posture remained unchanged. She swung the Heartless Sword faintly, like a flowing cloud brushing a sleeve... This time, everyone saw it clearly. A layer of colorless ice crystals coated the blade, refracting a crystalline, piercingly cold light.

Just as everyone thought she would use the Exquisite Profound Realm to retreat with all her might, she instead met the overwhelming barrage of silver light arrows head-on with her ice-coated sword.

Ting!!

The collision between the ice crystal and the first light arrow did not produce the deafening roar of the Great Wilderness Divine Vein erupting, but a crisp sound like jade striking jade. The icy light flickered, and the ferociously violent silver light arrow, originally aimed at Shen Wuyi's heart, had its trajectory deflected. It whistled past her side and struck the barrier at the edge of the battlefield, only then exploding with a destructive roar and profound light.

Dian Luohou's eyes were as wide as bronze bells. He had never been one to bother concealing his emotions, and now, his astonishment was clearly etched into every corner of his face. He, who inherited the Extreme Way Asura Divine Power and had painstakingly cultivated the Asura Myriad Manifestations Art for twenty thousand years, never knew that the incomparably domineering Asura Divine Power could be so... docile?

!?

The second light arrow followed closely, also colliding with the ice-coated sword. The same flash of ice crystals, the same light chime, and the second light arrow's trajectory was also bent, flying off at an angle. Then came the third, the fourth... the tenth... the hundredth...

Ting ting ting ting ting ting...

Her posture was like that of an immortal, her sword dance graceful and ethereal. The interplay of silver radiance and icy light draped her in a beautiful, dreamlike glow, causing the gazes of the shocked crowd to gradually become tinged with a stunned, dreamlike infatuation.

Boom boom boom boom boom—

The last of the light arrows all crashed into the barrier, erupting in a continuous sky of destructive silver light, which clearly illuminated Shen Wuyi's dustless sleeves and her tranquil, immortal face.

Dian Jiuzhi's hands remained in their previous posture, not launching another attack even after all the silver radiance had faded.

Everything today had been too illusory and absurd. Shock after shock, the repeated collapse of his understanding... The turmoil in his mind could no longer be calmed by reason.

"What... what sorcery is this?" an Asura elder muttered.

For someone of his power and status to utter the word "sorcery" showed just how utterly horrified he was.

However, Shen Wuyi gave Dian Jiuzhi no time to recover. Her longsword cut through the air, carving a foot-wide profound seal in the void. A heart-shaking might spread rapidly as the profound seal took shape.

"Purifying God Seal!" Meng Jianxi cried out in a low voice.

Yun Che had long known the name of the Purifying God Seal. It was the strongest and most core profound art of the Eternal Night Divine Nation. As one progressed, one could condense seven great profound seals: Illusion-Shattering, Calamity-Crossing, Dust-Cleansing, Heart-Washing, Soul-Quieting, Light-Tracing, and finally, the Godless World-Purifying Seal, which could only be formed after achieving the rank of Divine Sovereign!

"Shen Wuqing was not even qualified to cultivate the Purifying God Seal before his death. It's only been twenty years for Shen Wuyi, and she's already... hiss!"

Speaking to this point, Meng Jianxi drew a sharp breath. "But compared to that Exquisite Profound Realm and this strange ice, this is nothing. I just don't know which stage she has cultivated to."

"Wait!! Why is her Purifying God Seal... colorless!?"

The profound seal Shen Wuyi carved was initially crimson, but as the icy light flickered, the red color gradually faded. By the time it was fully formed, it was circulating with a translucent icy light, so pure it was devoid of any other color.

The Heartless Sword swung, and the Glazed Profound Seal flew down towards Dian Jiuzhi... Most people recognized it at a glance as the first seal of the Purifying God Seal—the Illusion-Shattering Seal, yet it was vastly different from the one they knew. Had the colorless icy light completely masked the originally powerful Godless Power?

The ice crystal profound seal released the aura of a level six Divine Extinction Realm cultivator, posing no threat to Dian Jiuzhi. But having learned his "lesson," he did not dodge or evade, simply ignoring it. He allocated two-tenths of his Great Wilderness Power to defense and released the remaining eight-tenths. The moment he raised his arm, the silver radiance transformed into a thousand-foot-long whip, capable of stirring up a ten-thousand-zhang² storm with a single swing.

The storm of destruction would thoroughly sweep across the entire battlefield. He was desperate to know how Shen Wuyi would evade this time.

The ice crystal profound seal was extremely fast. As it drew near, it was only slightly impeded by Dian Jiuzhi's aura before slamming heavily into his body, which had completely disregarded it.

Dian Jiuzhi's protective power flared, but the instant it shone, it suddenly dimmed by more than half.

Bang!

The ice seal shattered. Dian Jiuzhi's movements froze abruptly, his expression changing drastically.

A bone-chilling cold exploded in his right chest and then invaded his body, like billions of extremely cold needles piercing his flesh and meridians. His right arm went numb in an instant, and nearly half of his surging profound energy was sealed.

The whip formed from silver radiance was never swung. Dian Jiuzhi slowly lowered his head, staring blankly at his right chest... His protective profound light was still faintly glowing, not broken at all.

In that moment of stunned bewilderment, a cold aura assaulted him from above. The second seal of the Purifying God Seal—the Calamity-Crossing Seal—carrying a might and icy light twice as powerful as before, descended straight towards his head.

"The Heavenly Way draws near, wishing to grant her its protection; profound energy draws near, reluctant to cause her harm; sin draws near, and is overcome with shame..."

Li Suo's recent words echoed in Yun Che's soul sea. And at this moment, he was watching with his own eyes as, under the influence of that Glazed Glass Ice, all profound energy, whether for destruction or defense, exhibited an incomparably bizarre "docility."
