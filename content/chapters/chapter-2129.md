The sudden appearance of a Divine Forged Barrier¹ immediately diverted everyone's attention. Following this was Divine Venerable Wuming's² cold sneer: "Is this the so-called Perfect Divinity³ of the Weaving Dream Divine Kingdom⁴? It's utterly pathetic, simply laughable!"

Although Divine Venerable Wuming could not see, her spiritual perception was terrifyingly acute. Every wisp of aura, even the slightest change in facial expression of those present, would clearly register in her senses. To outsiders, the sudden formation of this barrier meant that Yun Che was struggling to withstand the divine pressure of this place and needed an isolating barrier to adjust and recover.

Facing Shen Wuyan Ye, Meng Kongchan⁵ showed no pleasant expression, stating in a deep voice: "My son has only returned for a few short years, and his cultivation is still shallow. With merely the fourth level of the Divine Master Realm⁶, it's naturally difficult for him to withstand the spiritual pressure here."

"On the contrary, Divine Venerable Wuming, in her esteemed position, actively challenges a junior she's just met. What? Could it be that the emergence of a man with a Perfect Divinity has struck a raw nerve with Divine Venerable Wuming?" It was widely known that Shen Wuyan Ye, having been hurt by her beloved, harbored an extreme aversion to men. Yet, those who dared to mock her directly with this fact were few and far between... Meng Kongchan was naturally one of them.

Shen Wuyan Ye, however, did not get angry. Instead, she let out a low chuckle that instilled fear in people's hearts: "A man with a Perfect Divinity is truly extraordinary. Then, Divine Venerable Wumeng, you must watch him carefully. Make sure he doesn't... perish... prematurely... again."

"..." Meng Kongchan let out a faint snort, seemingly disdaining to respond. But in the depths of his pupils, a streak of icy silver light flashed. Shen Wuyan Ye's words had undoubtedly touched his dragon's reverse scale⁷.

However, this was merely a verbal exchange between Divine Venerables. While it greatly increased his dislike for Shen Wuyan Ye, it wasn't enough to make him lose his composure. Yet, as a fellow Divine Venerable, he ultimately underestimated... or rather, he simply couldn't comprehend the terrifying madness born from Shen Wuyan Ye's extremely twisted psyche. In Shen Wuyi's⁸ soul sea, a telepathic message from Divine Venerable Wuming resonated.

"Find an opportunity and cripple Meng Jian Yuan." Compared to her identity as a Divine Venerable, she was a complete and utter madwoman.

"Yes." Facing this terrifyingly deranged command, Shen Wuyi accepted it without the slightest hesitation. Not even a ripple of emotion appeared on her face, only an eternally unchanging coolness and indifference. Hua Caili's⁹ beautiful eyes clearly could no longer maintain their calm. In just a few breaths, she had several times almost given in to the urge to approach Meng Kongchan and ask about Yun Che's well-being.

"Rest assured, completely."

Hua Fuchen¹⁰ once again soothed her with a soft voice: "With his father god by his side, it would be difficult for anything to happen to him. All your worries are superfluous."

He secretly sighed, his daughter truly was a love-struck fool; her state of mind would easily crumble whenever Yun Che was involved. But at the same time, a slight doubt arose in his heart. He had personally witnessed Yun Che's strength, which far surpassed his realm, coupled with his extraordinary mental fortitude. Logically, this shouldn't be happening... Inside the barrier, the world was empty. Only Yun Che's heavy gasps could be heard.

With a heavy "thud," he fell heavily to his knees, hand pressed to his chest, his entire body trembling like chaff. His chest heaved as if it would split open.

"Heh... hehe... ha...呜... uh..."

He hung his head, his falling hair obscuring his twitching features. He seemed to be laughing, but what escaped his lips were broken sobs.

"Ah... haha... hiss..."

"Heaven... have... mercy... you're still here..."

"You... you're really still here..."

Fate, once again, bestowed upon him a gift as beautiful as a dream. Lishuo's¹¹ figure slowly materialized before him, silently observing his current state. Since entering the Abyss World¹², every subtle change in Yun Che's emotions had been within her perception.

She felt his resolve and loneliness, sensed the heavy pressure he bore with every step and every decision, and... the absolute rationality, caution, and cold sobriety he had to maintain at all times. And at this moment, in the highest place of this Abyss World, at this Eden Cloud Peak¹³ where he absolutely could not allow himself to show any weakness, he let his emotions completely burst forth. Because the person who had just appeared in his eyes, the woman called Shen Wuyi... "Is she... Xia Qingyue¹⁴?" she asked softly.

When she attached herself to Yun Che, following the Primordial Seal of Life and Death¹⁵, Xia Qingyue had already fallen into the Abyss of Nothingness. Thus, she had never personally seen Xia Qingyue. But she had listened to Yun Che's conversations with the Ancestral Will¹⁶ and walked with Yun Che through that "Moon Memory"¹⁷ intertwined with so many emotions and karmic ties. She couldn't clearly understand romantic love, but she knew clearly enough what the name "Xia Qingyue" meant to Yun Che: extreme pain, extreme regret, extreme wounds, and extreme longing. Upon learning that there was another habitable world beneath the Abyss of Nothingness, his first desire was that Xia Qingyue might still be alive.

After entering the Abyss World, he had always used the name Yun Che. Even after expending immense effort to enter the Weaving Dream Divine Kingdom, he braved all resistance and still used the name Yun Che. A major reason for this was the hope that if Xia Qingyue were still alive, she might hear his name. He had once used the name of the Xuanji Palace¹⁸ to search... but in the vast Abyss World, there was simply no surname "Xia." Nor was there any woman whose beauty could compare to the Heaven-Folding Divine Maiden¹⁹. After that, he never tried to search again.

Xia Qingyue had fallen into the Abyss four years before him. Given the time-distorting black tides of the Abyss, she should have spent forty years in the Abyss World by the time he entered. If she were still alive, with her beauty, talent, and cultivation, it would be absolutely impossible for her to remain unknown for forty years. Even if she had changed her name from the start, she could still be easily found. Therefore, the answer was already in his subconscious.

He simply dared not touch upon it, nor had he ever mentioned it again, forcing himself to cling desperately to that faint hope, like a distant, fading star trail. And now, this extravagant wish, which he had thought shattered, was so unexpectedly presented before his eyes.

"It's her... it's her..."

He whispered in an utterly trembling voice, responding to Lishuo, and even more so, speaking to himself: "I absolutely... absolutely cannot be mistaken... she's still here... she's still here..."

"This is too good..."

"It's truly... too good..."

"I... finally... I..."

"He could no longer form words."

"I can feel that you are very agitated,"

Lishuo said softly: "Your soul is chaotic and very warm, as if it's about to ignite."

"All the joy and satisfaction I've felt from you over these years, perhaps combined, don't equal this single moment."

"So..."

Lishuo reached out, her snow-white finger covered in a faint white glow, gently touching Yun Che's trembling brow: "You absolutely cannot fail, right?"

"Otherwise, not only will your homeland suffer catastrophic disaster, but even this beautiful dream will turn into a shattered illusion." The light soothed his soul, quickly calming the turbulent waves in Yun Che's soul sea.

One breath... two breaths... three breaths... The heaving of his chest subsided, his breathing was no longer rapid, and gradually, the trembling of his body also ceased little by little. Yun Che slowly raised his head, his eyes misted over. The next instant, the mist dispersed, revealing those pupils that always held a hidden sobriety.

"Yes, of course." He smiled... It was the first smile without a trace of impurity since he entered the Abyss. But, disappointingly, the mist that had just cleared once again blurred his eyes, forcing him to quickly dispel it again.

She looked at Yun Che, no longer worried, and her figure silently vanished, leaving only a faint, ethereal whisper: "Protect yourself."

Yun Che closed his eyes... A moment later, he slowly opened them again. He no longer gave himself more time, extending his hand to touch the barrier. With a soft chime, the barrier shattered, and Yun Che's figure reappeared in everyone's sight. He was still as handsome and elegant as before, a faint, harmless, almost imperceptible smile playing on his lips. His demeanor was one of ease and composure, completely devoid of the embarrassment of being "forced to isolate himself for adjustment in public."

Yun Che's appearance eased Meng Kongchan's heart, and he smiled: "How was it?"

"Especially good."

Yun Che responded with a smile. The three words, though seemingly deliberate, were in fact insufficient to convey even a fraction of the joy in his soul.

"Mm."

Meng Kongchan nodded: "If you feel unwell, don't force yourself, and there's no need to care about others' gazes."

"Senior, rest assured."

Yun Che said with a smile: "With you by my side, why would I need to force myself?"

"Hahahahaha!"

Meng Kongchan burst into laughter, greatly pleased by Yun Che's reply. Faintly, he sensed a subtle change in Yun Che's soul state after he emerged from the barrier. It was as if a tightly locked switch had suddenly, and completely, opened. On the other side, Pan Buzhuo²⁰, who had been staring blankly at Shen Wuyi, suddenly shivered, abruptly turned his head, and met Pan Yusheng's²¹ cold, scrutinizing gaze. "Buzhuo,"

Pan Yusheng's face was grim: "She is the Daughter of Eternal Night. Don't forget the lesson from that rebellious son, Pan Buwang²²!"

Pan Buzhuo quickly composed himself and immediately said with a serious expression: "This woman's appearance is indeed stunningly beautiful. Your son was unprepared and momentarily lost his composure, but only just now. To your son now, even if she were ten times more alluring, she is still a Demonic Maiden of Eternal Night to be avoided like a viper!"

After staring at him for a while, Pan Yusheng finally nodded in satisfaction: "Good that you know."

Yun Che's gaze shifted, and he felt that the light here was exceptionally bright. The floating pure white clouds no longer carried an uncomfortable oppressiveness but were like ethereal mists of an immortal realm, refreshing to the heart and mind. He looked at Hua Caili, giving her a comforting glance... Unconsciously, his gaze was still drawn by an invisible force he couldn't fully control, landing on Shen Wuyi. Each time he reunited with her, she would be accompanied by a subtle transformation.

Later, he learned that it was the gradual awakening of her Glazed Heart²³ and the growth and integration of her Exquisite Body²⁴. Seeing her again, she had changed once more. In her eyes and on her body, a faint divine light, previously absent, subtly flowed, like an undying bright moon constantly reflecting eternal moonlight upon her. She had become so beautiful; even the Moon Goddess²⁵ of his childhood dreams couldn't compare to a fraction of her. Recalling his sixteen-year-old self, he would always nonchalantly hide the inferiority he couldn't completely dispel when facing her, and then he worked so hard to prove himself worthy of being his husband... And if he had faced her as she was now back then, he might not even have had the courage to look directly at her or touch her. Sensing the man's gaze, Shen Wuyi's eyes suddenly shot towards him, like a beautiful yet merciless glazed ice thorn, piercing directly into Yun Che's pupils. Such a gaze was enough to send a chill down anyone's spine.

But Yun Che did not avert his gaze; instead, a smile tilted his lips.

"Then, is that really her?"

Lishuo's voice echoed in his soul sea. She didn't want to shatter Yun Che's dream, but she still voiced her doubt: "But the way she looks at you is unfamiliar and cold, devoid of any emotional warmth."

"Even you almost lost control of your emotions when caught off guard. I don't believe she could perfectly feign such an encounter without any prior preparation."

"Yes, you're right. But... that is her. Even if only the last fragment of my soul remained, I could never mistake her or forget her."

He didn't deny it hastily but responded in a very gentle tone: "Her current name is Shen Wuyi. I believe, just as the rumors say, she has lost her past memories."

One of the rumors about the Divine Maiden of Eternal Night²⁶ was that she had lost her past before becoming a Divine Maiden. Perhaps she suffered some trauma that led to amnesia, but more people speculated that Divine Venerable Wuming had erased all her past memories and traces to create a flawless Divine Maiden. Yun Che recalled what the Ancestral God's Will had said before dissipating: "With the demise of the 'Instrument of Fate'²⁷, the chains of destiny between you two have also vanished. I no longer have a reason to remain here.

After today, I shall return to slumber to recover my depleted source energy as soon as possible." She was born as an "Instrument of Fate," and with the severing of the chains of destiny between him and her, her creation and the initial meaning of her existence also concluded... Could it be that her life as an "Instrument of Fate" also vanished with the completion of her "mission," severing all past and memories, returning to a completely independent, completely free life... No... it doesn't matter... whichever possibility, whatever the case... as long as you are still here, as long as you are alive, this is already the most beautiful outcome.

"The timing, it seems, doesn't quite fit either."

Lishuo continued to question. When it came to Shen Wuyi, she appeared even more rational than Yun Che.

"Xia Qingyue fell into the Abyss four years before you. Given the time-distorting black tides of the Abyss, by the time you entered, she had already existed in the Abyss for forty years."

"And Shen Wuyi became the Divine Maiden of Eternal Night twenty years ago."

"Therefore, when she became the Divine Maiden of Eternal Night, her age should not have been half a jiazi²⁸, but a full jiazi."

"Twenty years ago, Shen Wuyi's cultivation was at the Peak Divine Master Realm, consistent with Xia Qingyue's cultivation when she fell into the Abyss. However, Xia Qingyue possesses the Nine Profound Exquisite Body²⁹, which means she has no bottlenecks in her profound cultivation. It's impossible for her to have made no breakthroughs in her twenty years in the Abyss..."

Lishuo didn't want to agitate Yun Che, so her words were extremely gentle and slow. At the same time, she knew that Yun Che couldn't be unaware of such obvious facts.

"Perhaps... the rumors about her age and cultivation when she became the Divine Maiden of Eternal Night are erroneous."

Yun Che timely shifted his gaze away from Shen Wuyi, but a faint smile still hung on his lips: "I know all of this, but... it doesn't matter at all."

"Her being alive surpasses everything else. As for those twenty blank years, I'll just wait for her to tell me herself one day in the future."
