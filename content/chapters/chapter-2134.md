Facing Sha Xing's gaze, Pan Bu Wang's vision did not flinch in the slightest. His expression was cold, and his voice was even calmer, without a ripple: "Star God Child¹, to openly disparage my Owl Butterfly God Child² like this, are you not afraid that your own arrogance will backfire and wound your prestige!"

He repeated the words from moments ago, not missing a single one, as if afraid the Star God Child still "hadn't heard clearly." His tone was even several degrees heavier. In just a single breath, Sha Xing's eyes churned with the most complex changes he had ever experienced in his life... astonishment, bewilderment, blankness, shock, disbelief, incomprehension, unacceptability... all emotions chaotically intertwined, then finally settled, transforming into layers of disappointment, sarcasm, and... indignation.

"Heh... heheh."

He let out a strained laugh, three parts mocking others, seven parts mocking himself. The look he cast at Pan Bu Wang no longer held its previous clarity: "So? Pan Bu Wang, what do you intend to do? Could it be..."

Pan Bu Wang raised his right arm, and a pitch-black demonic spear instantly appeared in his hand, striking the ground heavily. Bang! A muffled thud, demonic light erupted, accompanied by an eerie hiss of dark profound energy³.

"Though our friendship runs deep, I am ultimately a God Child of the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom⁴! To me, the dignity of the Divine Kingdom transcends all else. Therefore, since you have disparaged my Owl Butterfly God Child, it is destined that I must raise my spear against you."

"Oh dear, oh dear."

Wu Shen Yue⁵ shook her head regretfully, slowly saying, "What a good show. It's a pity my Xing'er's⁶ sincere loyalty was misplaced on a jackal with a blackened soul."

Wu Shen Xing⁷ snorted indifferently, saying, "Indeed, two kinds of rats cannot emerge from the same hole⁸. But isn't this also a good thing for Xing? The sooner one sees through human nature, the sooner one grows."

"This Venerable One should actually thank this pathetic and pitiful Pan Bu Wang for giving Xing such a good lesson. This sudden stab in the back⁹ is worth more than thousands of my own guidance and teachings."

"Indeed."

Wu Shen Yue deeply agreed.

"Heheh... hahahaha!"

Facing Pan Bu Wang's words, Sha Xing scoffed, then allowed himself to laugh out loud, losing his composure: "I once regarded you as a close friend, because I respected your genuine love and hate, your actions matching your words... I was indeed too naive, not even realizing my eyes had been blind for so long."

"Constantly speaking of aversion, hatred, and then a heart as desolate as an abyss, yet in reality... deep down, you were desperate to find a pole to climb back up¹⁰."

His gaze no longer held respect, and his words no longer concealed his mockery: "What a pity, what a pity. This battle is a contest between God Children, and you don't even have the qualification to enter the arena and face me! Oh no, no, I almost forgot, you've already been expelled from the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom. Let alone an Owl Butterfly God Child, you aren't even considered an Owl Butterfly citizen!"

Pan Bu Wang's expression remained unchanged. He said coldly, "Star God Child, your words are mistaken. My Father God's annulment of my God Child title was merely declared verbally, without the formal annulment ceremony¹¹ ever being performed."

Amidst the slightly astonished gazes of the crowd, he calmly continued, "If strictly adhering to the rules, I, Pan Bu Wang, still count as an Owl Butterfly God Child!"

These words, however, caused many present to忍不住 (couldn't help but) snicker. A newly established God Child naturally requires a grand ceremony to announce it to the world. But to discard a God Child, why bother with an annulment ceremony?

"Pan Bu Wang, get down! Stop making a fool of yourself here!" Divine Venerable Qi Heng¹² finally spoke, his words laced with disgust and impatience, not even sparing Pan Bu Wang a glance from the corner of his eye. Pan Bu Wang did not move.

At this moment, the Grand Official's¹³ voice boomed like a great bell: "Pan Bu Wang's name is still recorded in the Six Kingdoms' God Child Register and has not been erased."

"If Pan Bu Wang no longer holds the title of God Child, his name can be removed by the Myriad Dao Divine Official¹⁴ after this assembly. But at this moment, he indeed has the qualification to participate in this battle." The Grand Official's words were final. Pan Yu Sheng¹⁵ showed a helpless expression. For a completely discarded waste, one who had even given up on himself, how could the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom specially travel to the Pure Land¹⁶ to visit the Myriad Dao Divine Official for him? And this minor oversight, which wasn't even a flaw, had become the reason for this abandoned child to cause trouble. Pan Bu Wang's challenge to Sha Xing would not elevate the Owl Butterfly God Child in anyone's eyes; it would only invite more ridicule. It was foreseeable that after Pan Bu Zhuo's¹⁷ crushing defeat, facing the enraged Sha Xing, Pan Bu Wang would only suffer an even more humiliating defeat, adding further disgrace to the already shamed Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom.

Pan Yu Sheng could not refute the Grand Official. He spoke again, "Pan Bu Wang, I'll say it one more time, get~ down~!"

His last three words carried the wrath of a Divine Venerable.

Sha Xing, however, spoke before Pan Bu Wang, loudly, "God Child Bu Wang¹⁸ has stepped forward to defend the honor of the Owl Butterfly God Child. Divine Venerable Qi Heng should commend him, why obstruct and get angry?"

The four words "God Child Bu Wang" carried an overflowing intensity of mockery.

"Good, very good."

The Heavenly Wolf Greatsword¹⁹, which had just been lowered, was raised again by Sha Xing, its tip pointing at his former close friend: "This battle, I accept. I hope God Child Bu Wang... will not~ be~ stingy~ with~ your~ guidance!"

Pan Bu Wang looked up, speaking faintly, "Star God Child seems to have misunderstood. The one I wish to challenge is not you, Star God Child, but... the Star-Moon Twin Jades²⁰!"

"..."

Sha Xing was momentarily stunned, his face suddenly darkening: "What... did you say!?"

Moon God Child Xian Yue's²¹ expression also changed slightly.

As if completely unaware of Sha Xing's sudden surge of anger, Pan Bu Wang continued to explain with a detached demeanor: "It is known to all that the perfect combination of the Star God Child and Moon God Child of the Star-Moon Divine Kingdom is the true form of the Star-Moon God Children. Fighting only one of them, for me, holds no meaning."

A commotion immediately arose, with sneers and low laughter echoing incessantly. The gazes directed at Pan Bu Wang changed again, as if looking at a clown displaying countless disgraceful behaviors.

"Oh, now I'm a bit confused."

Wu Shen Yue's demeanor instantly showed keen interest: "Such peculiar words don't seem like an act of allegiance to the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom; rather, it's like deliberately provoking Xing'er? Or perhaps using such a self-damaging cost to wound the Owl Butterfly's prestige?"

Wu Shen Xing narrowed her eyes: "Probably the latter... oh no, it should be both. After all, by provoking the Heavenly Wolf, the latter can be achieved more thoroughly. Regardless, it's very interesting, isn't it?"

"Extremely interesting." Wu Shen Yue's eyes narrowed into two long slits, hiding a seductive glint.

Pan Bu Zhuo, clutching his right cheek, moved to Pan Yu Sheng's side and hissed, "Father God, he's not disgusting Star-Moon; he's disgusting us..."

Pan Yu Sheng said coldly, "Shut up."

Pan Bu Zhuo immediately fell silent.

"Heh... heheheheh!"

Sha Xing laughed... and at this moment, he truly experienced what it meant to laugh out of extreme anger.

"Challenge the Star-Moon Twin Jades? Do you even deserve it?"

His gaze at Pan Bu Wang was unfamiliar and icy: "However, since God Child Bu Wang has such courage, how... can I be stingy?"

Bang! The Heavenly Wolf Holding Star²² slammed heavily onto the ground, and a terrifying wave of energy, carrying the Star God Child's wrath, vibrated in all directions, violently whipping Pan Bu Wang's black hair and clothes, making them flap loudly.

"Today, if you have the ability to defeat me, I will bring Moon God Child along and graciously allow you to witness what the Star-Moon Twin Jades are. Is God Child Bu Wang satisfied?"

The words "ability" and "graciously allow" were equally overflowing with mockery.

"Good."

Pan Bu Wang agreed without a trace of hesitation, saying cheerfully, "Above the Pure Land, beside the Abyss Emperor²³, you cannot go back on your word!"

As his words fell, he transformed into a shadow, entering the barrier, facing Sha Xing a hundred zhang²⁴ apart. A moment ago, they were close friends walking side by side; now, their eyes met, separated as if by a thousand ravines.

"Pan Bu Wang, do you know what you look like in my eyes now?"

Sha Xing chuckled lowly: "A stray dog²⁵, stripped of its fur, its spine broken, thrown out the main gate, yet still wagging its tail and clamoring for its master²⁶, willing to lose all dignity and shame just to crawl back over the threshold."

Sha Xing had never deigned to utter such insulting words... nor had he ever imagined that Pan Bu Wang would be on the receiving end of such words. Pan Bu Wang showed no anger or annoyance; his eyes were like a pool of stagnant water. And his emotions were as calm as his expression.

What resonated in his Soul Sea²⁷ were the Mist Emperor's²⁸ words from that day.

...

"Master, what exactly should this disciple do when going to the Pure Land this time?"

Mist Emperor: "Wait! Wait until the God Child Battle, when Sha Xing, to vent your hatred, publicly defeats Pan Bu Zhuo, shattering his God Child dignity."

Bu Wang: "But... allowing Sha Xing to bring me into the Pure Land is already a great favor. Why would he risk offending the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom for this disciple?"

Mist Emperor: "Actively inform him of your 'Mist Emperor's disciple' identity. He will. Because at that time, you will not only be a friend who trusts him and actively seeks his help, but you will also share a common secret about the 'Mist Emperor'."

"The most invisible bond that deepens a relationship is a shared secret. The bigger the secret, the more unbreakable the bond."

"Coupled with his eagerness to repay and clear the Mist Emperor's kindness... with his character, he will definitely do what he believes is right."

Bu Wang: "Since it is Master's judgment, it must be correct. What should this disciple do then?"

Mist Emperor: "After Pan Bu Zhuo's defeat, you, in the guise of an Owl Butterfly God Child, using the justification of restoring the Owl Butterfly God Child's name, declare war on Sha Xing!"

Bu Wang: "Uh?"

"But... but this disciple is so down and out, only Sha Xing treats me as before. This friendship is precious, and he is this disciple's only true friend in this world."

"If, as Master says, he would risk offending the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom for this disciple, his righteousness is as heavy as a mountain. How can this disciple commit such an act of betrayal and disloyalty..."

Mist Emperor: "Shut up!! Pan Bu Wang, your own blood brother can trample and humiliate you into the mud to secure his position, and even cause your mother's death! Your own father, who once doted on you, can throw you out of the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom like trash to protect him. Even blood relatives are like this, yet you, who now have nothing, are still so cowardly and pedantic for the sake of so-called friendship!!"

"It seems I was mistaken! You are destined to be a useless waste your entire life! Take your 'friendship' that you refuse to let go of, and get out of here!"

Bu Wang: "...Master, please calm your anger! Master's words are like a sudden enlightenment²⁹; this disciple knows his mistake and will never repeat it. I beg Master's forgiveness! On the Pure Land, this disciple will do his utmost to defeat Sha Xing!"

...

Pan Bu Wang held his spear, its shaft swirling with faint dark ripples, slowly leveling it in front of him with the movement of his arm. In the Mist Sea, he grew every day. Among them, the slowest growth was his profound energy, while the fastest was his dark talent and temperament... both completely transformed. And this unexpected battle, in the eyes of others, was not part of the God Child Battle, but a complete joke.

Pan Bu Zhuo had already suffered a crushing defeat at Sha Xing's hands, so how could Pan Bu Wang, whose divine essence and dark talent were inferior to Pan Bu Zhuo's, be Sha Xing's opponent... The so-called "witnessing the Star-Moon Twin Jades" was an even greater joke.

Looking at the spear in Pan Bu Wang's hand, Sha Xing let out another sneer: "This spear, I'm afraid, doesn't suit your status as an Owl Butterfly God Child. Or, perhaps borrow the Cold Crow³⁰ of another Owl Butterfly God Child? Lest you say I won unfairly. As fellow Owl Butterfly God Children, and blood relatives, how could he bear to refuse... right?"

"No need."

Pan Bu Wang replied indifferently, speaking softly, "This spear is named 'Silent Night Everlasting Star'³¹. It was used by my mother during her lifetime. When she gave it to me, my mother said that the Everlasting Star is the Morning Star³². Even if I lose everything and fall into the silent night, as long as the spear is here, she will always be by my side, guiding me."

As he spoke, the dark, eerie glow flowing around the spear's shaft seemed to be tinged with a faint warmth. Pan Yu Sheng averted his gaze, not a trace of shame in his eyes.

"..." Sha Xing did not mock him further. With a low roar, the shadow of the Heavenly Wolf suddenly revealed its fangs, its power and might even surpassing when it faced Pan Bu Zhuo.

"Considering our past friendship, I'll give you one last dignity... granting you the most direct and tragic defeat!" Howl! The Heavenly Wolf howled at the moon, its furious roar shaking the sky. The greatsword, swirling with destructive aura, crashed down upon Pan Bu Wang. The hundred zhang space instantly shrunk under the terrifying Heavenly Wolf divine light. The dreadful Heavenly Wolf pressure had not even reached his body, yet it forced Pan Bu Wang to retreat half a step. He stared at the rapidly expanding shadow of the Heavenly Wolf in his pupils, a deep, dark, unusual glint shining in his eyes.

...

Bu Wang: "...On the Pure Land, this disciple will do his utmost to defeat Sha Xing!"

Mist Emperor: "No, what you need to do is not defeat, but crush!"

Bu Wang: "Crush? Please enlighten me, Master."

Mist Emperor: "Crush him within three exchanges!"

Bu Wang: "Master, it's not that this disciple underestimates himself³³. This disciple has full confidence in defeating Sha Xing, but three exchanges... this disciple truly cannot achieve."

Mist Emperor: "In a direct confrontation, you naturally cannot. But don't forget, when you fight Sha Xing, you have a huge advantage. That is..."

"Cognitive bias!"

"Your current body has achieved perfect affinity with dark profound energy. Such affinity is unprecedented in the history of the Abyss; even your Father God cannot hope for it. This means that anyone who fights you for the first time will definitely misjudge your control over dark power."

Bu Wang: "Master means... to win by surprise³⁴??"

Mist Emperor: "Exactly. You must utilize this advantage, which can basically only be used once, to its absolute maximum!"

"The God Child Battle is not entirely equivalent to an ordinary battle of victory and defeat. According to past conventions, it will be limited to a barrier only ten thousand zhang wide."

"The first thing you need to do is to anger Sha Xing. Your public betrayal is the first layer of anger. The second layer of anger is to declare a direct challenge to the Star-Moon Twin Jades."

"Anger will devour sobriety. A mature expert will try to extinguish anger as much as possible during a fight, but the Heavenly Wolf is different. Because anger will boost the power of the Heavenly Wolf, Sha Xing will not suppress his anger; instead, he will let it burn within him."

"Under anger, he will inevitably want to give you a crushing defeat in the shortest possible time. Then, the sword stance he uses next will follow his burning anger."

"He will strike before you. The first sword will be two parts 'Heavenly Wolf Slash,' seven parts 'Savage Fang'³⁵, and one part 'Instant Prison Calamity'... I will now teach you how to identify the starting stances of these sword moves..."

...

Everything unfolded exactly as if following a script pre-written by his Master, with almost no difference.

The very first moment Sha Xing raised his sword, he recognized it: it was the second sword of the Heavenly Wolf Prison God Canon³⁶ — Savage Fang!

He couldn't understand, nor did he dare to ask, why his Master knew the Star-Moon Divine Kingdom's Heavenly Wolf sword techniques to such a terrifying extent.

...

"If his opening sword move is 'Savage Fang,' you must retreat half a step to the left, and when receiving the move, show three parts of a losing stance... When 'Savage Fang' forms such a suppressive posture, Sha Xing will have over ninety percent chance of unleashing 'Heavenly Star Lament'³⁷."

"'Heavenly Star Lament' has immense power and immense flaws. However, once the preceding move creates enough suppression, one can disregard the flaws during the execution of 'Heavenly Star Lament'... In Sha Xing's perception, and in the perception of everyone in the Abyss, even if you completely abandon defense and fight with your life on the line³⁸, you cannot, while suppressed, unleash enough dark profound energy to seize the flaw."

"Then, when his Heavenly Star faintly glows, strike the spot three fingers below his right shoulder bone with an instantaneous burst of dark power. In that instant, the newly surging Heavenly Star power will completely dissipate, backfiring and devouring him!"
