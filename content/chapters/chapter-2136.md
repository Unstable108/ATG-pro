The world of Sha Xing¹ and Xian Yue² was plunged into lightless darkness. Even the dazzling Heavenly Wolf Divine Radiance and the magnificent Purple Palace Splendor were completely swallowed by this darkness, so dense it was eerie. If this darkness had merely overwhelmed their five senses, at most it would have caused them a momentary shock… but the instant the darkness struck, their souls suddenly trembled violently.

Their outwardly released soul auras and intricately intertwined soul strings seemed to be suddenly torn and cut by countless pitch-black demonic blades and saw-like knives. In the throes of intense soul pain and fear, before they could even react, they were violently ripped apart and disintegrated. Buzz— Their soul seas³ buzzed, then transformed into boundless darkness. If Sha Xing or Xian Yue had faced this "Pan Yuan Duan Ye"⁴ alone, even when encountering it for the first time and caught off guard, they would only have experienced a loss of their five senses for several breaths and several moments of mental blankness… it wouldn't have been fatal in a direct confrontation. However, the Star Moon Divine Children's⁵ perfect fusion meant that forty percent of their connection was through profound energy aura, and sixty percent was through soul aura. Their soul auras perfectly blended and relied on each other, essentially giving one person the perception of two.

If, in such a state, their perception was suddenly and defenselessly severed in an instant, they would naturally suffer more than double the soul collapse⁶. The consequence was a mental blankness lasting nearly a breath for both Divine Children! Pan Bu Wang⁷ did not move his feet; only the Ji Ye Chang Geng⁸ in his hand swept out horizontally, carving a deep, dark scar of night in the boundless darkness, a scar that seemed to cleave the darkness itself.

The darkness devoured light, devoured aura and soul aura, and even swallowed all sound. Everyone only saw two bent and twisted figures fly out of the barrier⁹ overwhelmed by darkness. They flew out of the darkness, and out of the barrier, landing on the ground at the same instant, in the same stiff posture. They did not immediately stand up, but remained rigidly frozen in place for a short while, like two soulless puppets. Bang!

Clang! With two heavy thuds, the Heavenly Wolf Greatsword and the Purple Palace Sword also flew out of the darkness, accurately plunging into the ground beside the two. It was at this moment that the Star Moon Divine Children's pupils regained focus and clarity. They rose, their hands instinctively gripping their Divine Child weapons, but then their bodies and expressions froze in place again, staring blankly at the barrier in their line of sight. The darkness dissipated, revealing Pan Bu Wang's figure once more.

He still stood in his original spot, as if his feet had not moved an inch from beginning to end. The deathly silence, as if frozen, also disintegrated with the dissipation of the darkness, erupting into an uncontrolled wave of voices.

"Wha… what happened?"

"The Star Moon Twin Jades¹⁰… instantly defeated? This… this…"

"It seems the Star Moon Twin Jades' soul connection was instantly disintegrated, leading to soul collapse."

"Records of dark profound energy indeed mention its supreme soul-devouring ability among all profound energies. But the dark profound art practiced by the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom¹¹ clearly doesn't specialize in this area. I've never seen or heard of Pan Bu Wang's Soul-Devouring Dark Domain¹²!"

"The most terrifying thing is that this Soul-Devouring Dark Domain spread almost instantly… let alone two young people, even an old man like me would be stunned for a good while."

"…"

Pan Bu Zhuo's¹³ mouth, which had been agape, closed with considerable difficulty. He forced himself to concentrate, lowering his voice, "Father God, this… this is not our Owl Butterfly's technique at all! This… what exactly is it…?"

His question received no response. When he turned his gaze, for the first time in his life, he clearly saw an expression of "shock" on his Father God's face. Looking around, the faces of all the Owl Butterfly experts were filled with astonishment.

"Sha Xing and Xian Yue have left the barrier, this battle, Pan Bu Wang wins!" The Grand Priest's¹⁴ voice rang out, finally calming the chaotic clamor. As he made this announcement, the Grand Priest's gaze lingered briefly on Pan Bu Wang. Clap! Clap! Clap!

Wu Shen Xing¹⁵ rose, clapping his hands in praise, "Although the victory and defeat were decided in an instant, it was undoubtedly spectacular, truly an eye-opener for this Venerable One¹⁶, I can't help but sigh in admiration."

As a Divine Venerable¹⁷, his words held no pretense or sarcasm, and his praise was unreserved.

"Xing, Yue."

He looked at Sha Xing and Xian Yue, who were still somewhat dazed, "Since you two achieved perfect fusion, you have never suffered a single defeat against enemies beyond the first realm. Yet today, facing an opponent of the same realm, you were defeated in a single breath."

"Do you feel any resentment about this outcome?"

Tian Xing Divine Venerable's¹⁸ voice dispelled the lingering dark gloom in their souls. Their expressions gradually regained solemnity, and both bowed in unison, "This disciple admits defeat wholeheartedly. Today's defeat will surely be etched in our hearts."

Frankly admitting it, in fact, reclaimed their shattered dignity to the greatest extent.

"It's alright."

Wu Shen Yue¹⁹ smiled reassuringly, "Today's defeat will become tomorrow's fruitful achievement. Come, first cast aside distracting thoughts and calm your minds."

Everyone's gaze was focused on Pan Bu Wang.

Wu Shen Xing said frankly, "My unworthy disciple, Sha Xing, spoke frivolously and inappropriately after a minor victory over Divine Child Bu Zhuo. Now, he has received a lesson and punishment from Divine Child Bu Wang. The pain on his face will likely last for many years and be difficult to fade."

"Congratulations, Qi Heng Divine Venerable²⁰, congratulations, Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom. Such an outstanding divine successor, even placed in history, he would be considered astonishingly brilliant, truly making one extremely envious." Pan Bu Zhuo had been defeated and humiliated by Sha Xing. Pan Bu Wang's instant defeat of Sha Xing undoubtedly recovered the lost face of the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom many times over. And his single-handed defeat of the Star Moon Twin Jades… it was no exaggeration to say that the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom, which had always been at the bottom in terms of overall strength, had never had a Divine Child in any generation who had blossomed with such a shocking dark splendor that captivated the entire audience. However, no one in the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom could bring themselves to smile, nor could they show the pride and excitement that should have been evident on their faces.

Qi Heng Divine Venerable's response was also extremely stiff, "Tian Xing Divine Venerable, you exaggerate, it was merely a stroke of luck."

The Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom's reaction was not surprising. After all, it concerned the succession of Divine Children, and all the divine kingdoms knew a little about what had happened during this period. If Pan Bu Zhuo had been the one to achieve this, the entire Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom would probably have been so excited they would be jumping and shouting, disregarding all decorum.

But it was Pan Bu Wang… they only felt an unspeakable discomfort. Pan Bu Zhuo gritted his teeth; he was clearly trying to maintain composure and calmness, but the corners of his mouth were clearly twitching intermittently.

He knew perfectly well that after today, even if he remained the sole Divine Child of the Owl Butterfly, and even if Pan Bu Wang remained an abandoned child²¹, Pan Bu Wang's reputation would surely overshadow his own. And he, the Divine Child of the Owl Butterfly, would become a foil… or even a laughingstock for a considerable period.

"Pan Bu Wang,"

The Grand Priest's voice rang out again, "You may choose an opponent to fight, or you may choose to rest for a while."

Pan Bu Wang did not move; he was still looking straight ahead, but the corner of his eye, however, uncontrollably fell upon Shen Wu Yi²² again and again. 'After defeating the Star Moon Divine Children, it is time for you to decisively withdraw. You must not hesitate or waver in the slightest, and absolutely must not cause any trouble! No matter how much you hate Pan Bu Zhuo, no matter how much you want to kill Shen Wu Yi…' His Master's²³ admonition echoed repeatedly in his soul sea, and the edge of his vision finally completely left Shen Wu Yi.

But the next instant, the figure he had just resolutely pushed away suddenly appeared directly in front of his line of sight. A dark shadow flickered, and Shen Wu Yi stepped into the barrier, facing Pan Bu Wang directly.

"Shen Wu Yi of the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom²⁴, I ask for your guidance."

Her ethereal voice suddenly rose, like frost flowing under the moonlight, chilling to the bone, yet carrying a clear, untainted, and lofty solitude. Pan Bu Wang's gaze met hers… an extremely beautiful face, an aura like a distant, dreamlike immortal. What it evoked in his eyes was not astonishment, but a bone-deep killing intent that almost burst forth uncontrollably. 'Do not hesitate… do not cause trouble… no matter how much you want to kill Shen Wu Yi…' 'Do not cause trouble…' 'Do not…' His fingers curled slightly, and after several breaths, they slowly relaxed.

"I apologize,"

He spoke, his voice like a bell tolling in a cold night, carrying a distant chill, "I have no reason to fight you. According to the rules of previous Divine Child battles…"

"I concede." The three words most difficult to utter in a Divine Child battle were spoken with utmost simplicity from his mouth, without a trace of unwillingness, nor a hint of resentment, as calm as a cold spring in late autumn.

"…" Shen Wu Yi did not respond. Everyone looked at each other in dismay; it was another unexpected outcome. They could no longer understand or predict what Pan Bu Wang was doing, or what he intended to do… nor did they know what had happened to him during the years he had "disappeared."

The Grand Priest's gaze once again fixed on Pan Bu Wang, "With such flourishing demeanor, you might receive the Abyssal Emperor's²⁵ bestowal. Do you truly wish to concede without fighting?"

The Grand Priest never spoke unnecessarily, but this sentence was an extremely rare piece of advice given to a Divine Child by him. Clearly, he understood the extraordinary talent Pan Bu Wang had displayed better than almost everyone present.

"Yes." Amidst everyone's astonishment and confusion, Pan Bu Wang's answer followed immediately after the Grand Priest's last word, without even a moment's hesitation.

The Grand Priest said no more, announcing, "Thus, in this battle, Shen Wu Yi of Eternal Night wins without fighting."

Once defeated in a Divine Child battle, one cannot fight again… however, the Abyssal Emperor's final choice was not entirely determined by victory or defeat. Pan Bu Wang turned around calmly, as if to walk out of the barrier. Just then, a voice rang out in everyone's ears, instantly silencing all sounds on Eden Cloud Peak²⁶ and halting every wisp of flowing aura.

"Pan Bu Wang, come forward alone to this one²⁷." Pan Bu Wang's steps halted, his gaze blank, remaining motionless for a long time, as if stunned. On Eden Cloud Peak, it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. From the Divine Venerables of the divine kingdoms to the young profound practitioners²⁸, everyone's expressions were frozen stiff, and for a long time, no one dared to utter a word, only their hearts pounded like war drums.

Pan Bu Zhuo stood dumbfounded, completely losing his soul. In Qi Heng Divine Venerable's eyes, shock and bewilderment churned, nearly dozens of times greater than before.

"Yes."

Pan Bu Wang seemed to have just come back to his senses, responding with a single, somewhat dry and difficult word, before turning his body and walking towards the Abyssal Emperor. His steps were very cautious and slow, as if treading on clouds in a dream. The Abyssal Emperor, who had always been merely an observer in Divine Child battles, basically never uttered a word throughout, and whose expression never showed the slightest change, actually took the initiative to utter a sacred decree, calling out to Pan Bu Wang… what this meant, they didn't even dare to speculate wildly.

Finally, under the gazes of everyone who dared not look away for an instant, he arrived before the Abyssal Emperor, and knelt in homage. The Abyssal Emperor's figure descended from the sky, standing in front of Pan Bu Wang, only a step away. He reached out, and a hand as white as sacred jade, overflowing with a hazy divine light, touched Pan Bu Wang's shoulder… after a brief moment, it withdrew. "Pan Bu Wang,"

He softly called the young man's name. It was clearly the voice of an emperor, yet it was as warm and gentle as the clinking of warm jade, elegant and soft: "Would you be able to tell this one, where did you obtain the dark soul domain you just displayed?"

It was not a command; he used the words "would you be able to," giving Pan Bu Wang the right to refuse to answer. The world was incredibly quiet, as if everyone had forgotten to breathe.

Pan Bu Wang looked up slightly. He did not evade the Abyssal Emperor's gaze, but as a junior, he naturally dared not meet the Abyssal Emperor's eyes directly: "Replying to the Abyssal Emperor, Bu Wang comprehended it himself."

He did not refuse to answer, and this answer undoubtedly shocked everyone endlessly. If it was truly self-created and self-comprehended… what astonishing dark talent must one possess to comprehend such a dark, miraculous technique capable of instantly defeating the Star Moon Twin Jades? As he spoke these words, a wave of sorrow and melancholy, clearly difficult to suppress and gradually spiraling out of control, flowed out from Pan Bu Wang.

…………

Mist Emperor²⁹: 'Bu Wang, before entering the Pure Land³⁰, there is one thing you must prepare yourself mentally for. That is… after you successfully defeat the Star Moon Divine Children, the Abyssal Emperor might fix his gaze upon you and inquire about the origin of 'Pan Yuan Duan Ye'.'

Bu Wang: 'Bu Wang dares not question Master's words. But, allow this disciple to speak more, throughout history, even when divine kingdoms faced great calamities and chaos, and Divine Venerables changed, the Abyssal Emperor never even glanced sideways. How could he pay attention to a mere disciple like me…'

Mist Emperor: 'You just need to obey!'

Bu Wang: 'Yes.'

Mist Emperor: 'If this truly happens, you know how to answer.'

Bu Wang: 'Pan Yuan Duan Ye' was comprehended by this disciple in gloom and silence… but, how could this disciple's lie deceive the Abyssal Emperor?'

Mist Emperor: 'If falsehood cannot conceal, then let it be self-destructive.'

Bu Wang: '…Please, Master, instruct me.'

Mist Emperor: 'Think of your mother, think of your Shen Wu Qing³¹, think of your utterly destitute self! Let pain, sorrow, unwillingness, and despair fill your soul, devouring all other emotions… including falsehood and lies!'

…………

As excessively painful memories spread through his soul sea, Pan Bu Wang's fingers curled, and his body trembled uncontrollably.

"Bu Wang… lost his closest kin… lost his beloved… once felt his heart turn to ashes, moved to weave dreams, only wishing to forever fall into an illusionary dream… later expelled, wandering the Mist Sea³²…"

His voice became strained and hoarse; every word seemed imbued with tangible despair, piercing the heart and soul of every listener.

"Once, near death in the Mist Sea, his soul sinking into a dream, only wishing to forever fall into the dark night… when he awoke, darkness filled the sky around him, only the 'Ji Ye Chang Geng' in his hand trembled and whined, like a mother's hand, pulling me back from the fallen night…"

"I was like a newborn, rose and used my spear to sever the dark night… at that instant, a sudden, inexplicable enlightenment arose in my heart… and I named it: Pan Yuan Duan Ye."

Most of those present knew more or less about Pan Bu Wang's experiences. With the Abyssal Emperor present, he was desperately trying to control his emotions. But… despair piercing to the bone, pain searing the heart, every word stained with blood… making it impossible for anyone not to feel sorrow for him.

Pan Yuan Duan Ye… comprehended in the soul injury³³ of near-death, no wonder it possessed such terrifying soul-devouring power. The Abyssal Emperor nodded slightly, then he raised his hand and gently patted Pan Bu Wang's shoulder twice. This was a comfort from the Abyssal Emperor, a divine grace that countless Divine Children wouldn't even dare to dream of… it made Pan Yu Sheng's³⁴ eyebrows twitch wildly, and the entire Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom felt their emotions churn like a turbulent sea. And the Abyssal Emperor's next words shook hearts as if heaven and earth had been inverted, utterly astonishing.

"I once believed that the world could no longer give birth to a pure Child of Darkness. Yet... in this era, this long-cherished wish is fulfilled."
