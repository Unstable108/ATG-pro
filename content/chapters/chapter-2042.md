The profound energy phenomenon presented by the Glazed Ice was not unfamiliar to Yun Che. Because he possessed the primordial Dragon God's bloodline, he was the absolute bane of all dragons in the current era. Not only did his soul strike fear into all dragons, but even the power they directed at him would uncontrollably recoil.

Back in the God Realm, Long Bai, who also possessed the Dragon God's bloodline and was the supreme sovereign of his time, found that his power would weaken by thirty percent before it even reached Yun Che.

The result was similar, but the nature was entirely different. Facing the Glazed Ice, profound energy didn't recoil and weaken, but rather... it was as if it had gained some bizarre spiritual consciousness and naturally retreated. It would not defend; it could not bear to inflict harm.

Therefore, the Glazed Ice's own power wasn't immense. Yet, due to its primordial origin and its exceptionally unique, ultimate purity, it conceptually "weakened" the power of others to a great extent. This allowed Shen Wuyi, at the sixth level of the Divine Extinction Realm, to easily withstand the Great Wasteland power of a Divine Extinction eighth-level, and even more easily pierce through Dian Jiuzhi's suddenly listless protective profound energy.

Yun Che murmured softly, "So, this is the true form of the Heart of Glazed Ice and Snow..."

Like the Nine Profound Exquisite Body, he had long known the name "Heart of Glazed Ice and Snow," and the various rumors and records about it were a jumbled mess. Among them, a few relatively accepted points claimed that its heart and soul were crystal clear and blessed by the Heavenly Way. Once "awakened," its owner was destined for greatness, to become a king or emperor, their fate extraordinary. The blessing of the Heavenly Way was mentioned most often; some firmly believed it, while others scoffed.

All these rumors and records were undoubtedly a synthesis of the traits displayed by all historical possessors of the Heart of Glazed Ice and Snow. Yet, no one knew its true origin or why it was named "Glazed"¹—no record ever mentioned it... It turned out that its true essence had long been annihilated in the filthy dust of a bygone era, before the Age of Gods had even truly begun, forever lost to the world.

Her Exquisite Body and Glazed Heart had also manifested clearly in their original world, allowing her to transcend laws and, with extremely limited experience, see through the treachery of human hearts and plan for the grand scheme of things... It was just that neither had ever fully interpreted what "Exquisite" or "Glazed" truly meant. It seemed that back in the God Realm, the growth and awakening of both her Exquisite Body and Glazed Heart had been merely in their budding stages.

But... why?

In the mere few decades since she fell into the Abyss, why had such a tremendous change occurred in her? The Ancestral God's creation... the Ancestral God's sacred breath... a person without cause... The worlds were completely isolated, cause and effect severed forever. She was no longer an instrument of fate, no longer had any past, no longer had any former memories...

In that case... was she... still her?

Should I now call her Shen Wuyi... or... selfishly... make her remember the name "Xia Qingyue" and drag her back into the fate she once bore as "Xia Qingyue"...

Faced with the second Glazed Profound Seal, Dian Jiuzhi seemed to want to prove something and reached out to grab it directly. The Glazed Profound Seal did not warp through space, colliding straight with Dian Jiuzhi's arm.

With the sound of an ice explosion, the Glazed Profound Seal shattered in mid-air... but a terrifying chill still pierced straight to his marrow, causing the blood flow in his arm to halt, his profound energy to stagnate, and his arm to freeze stiffly in the air for a moment.

This time, Dian Jiuzhi felt it with absolute clarity. Against a power that was clearly only at the sixth level of the Divine Extinction Realm, his own Great Wasteland power had only managed to block less than half of it. And his body, which should have been incomparably tough, seemed to have become exceptionally frail, sealed by the ice to such an extent. His profound energy, his very body, seemed to have suddenly lost its instinct to repel external forces, apathetically allowing this icy power to invade.

An endless sense of absurdity piled up in his soul sea again and again. The world within the barrier felt like a bizarre, grotesque, and fantastical dream.

A sharp glint of cold light stabbed into his eyes. During this renewed lapse in his concentration, Shen Wuyi had already formed her third Glazed Profound Seal. It was the Dust-Cleansing Seal, radiating a majestic aura. Though only ten feet wide, it bore down with the chilling might of a thousand-foot mountain.

Dian Jiuzhi closed his eyes... This time, he even sealed off his five senses completely.

Unavoidable, unknowable, unstoppable... Then he would not see, not hear, not feel! Thus, he could be without sensation, without shock, without fear. Even if he had already made a spectacle of himself, he absolutely could not... disgrace the dignity of the Myriad Manifestations God Kingdom!

Bang!

The Great Wasteland power surged wildly, causing his arms to burst with blood and his flesh to split open. He almost cruelly forced his power through his arms, which had grown rigid in the cold. The dim silver radiance around him erupted, shining like a silver sun and completely engulfing his figure.

The Glazed Dust-Cleansing Seal descended from above, sealing the space he occupied. With his senses shut off, Dian Jiuzhi was oblivious, his rampaging Great Wasteland power the only thing forming a hundred-foot-tall giant shadow... Yet this hundred-foot shadow emanated a terrifying spiritual pressure that even a ten-thousand-foot mountain could not match.

BOOM!!

The Glazed Dust-Cleansing Seal crashed down like a star falling from the heavens. The dense silver radiance rippled strangely under the translucent ice light, like water being smoothly parted. By the time the Glazed Dust-Cleansing Seal passed through the silver light, its icy glow had only weakened by about sixty percent before it exploded violently upon Dian Jiuzhi's body.

The ice light bloomed within the silver radiance, causing the silver light to distort violently. The sealing of his profound energy made the hundred-foot shadow shrink abruptly to seventy feet. This time, the chill was not only bone-deep but soul-piercing. However, it no longer caused Dian Jiuzhi to feel surprise or recoil. He didn't even try to dispel the cold energy, keeping his five senses sealed as the seventy-foot shadow raised a fist and struck the air, unleashing the ferocious power originating from the Great Wasteland Divine Veins.

"Myriad Manifestations... Great Wasteland Star Devourer!!"

RUMBLE—

Silver light blanketed the sky. Even the barrier could not contain the overly intense destructive glow of that instant, which shone straight across the entire Eden Cloud Top.

Cries of alarm erupted from the surroundings. Yun Che's gaze was fixed as he clearly saw a ten-foot-wide gap embedded within the sky-filling, destructive silver light. That gap reflected a pure, flawless icy glow, and within it stood Shen Wuyi, safe and sound. When the surging destructive power around her touched the ice light, it would transform into gentle, harmless streams of light that refracted past, unable to penetrate in the slightest.

One breath, two breaths, three breaths... Despite its world-destroying might, the attack remained unable to shatter or harm the seemingly fragile ice crystal.

As the silver light gradually faded, the battlefield within the barrier was revealed once more. Shen Wuyi held her sword, condensing ice. As her sword light danced, a four-leaf-clover-shaped profound seal quickly formed. The moment it took shape, it shed all color, leaving only a glazed translucence.

"Heart-Purifying Seal... Hiss! Just what realm has she cultivated to!?" Meng Jianxi exclaimed in shock.

At the same time, the briefly dormant Great Wasteland power erupted once more, seemingly several degrees more ferocious than before. This time, the silver light coiling around Dian Jiuzhi's body took on a strange, rippling pattern, like roaring thunder or a raging sea. The moment the Glazed Heart-Purifying Seal descended, his power exploded in tandem. A soft chant, originating from his soul sea and audible only to himself, escaped his lips: "Myriad Manifestations... Wasteland Ruins Grinding the Sea!"

The instant the Great Wasteland power surged, the space within the barrier, along with all gazes directed at it, was instantly twisted and bent. The Purifying Seal and the Great Wasteland power engulfed each other almost simultaneously.

The sound of ice shattering echoed in Dian Jiuzhi's soul sea. He felt his very soul turn cold, and the profound energy in his body seemed to be obstructed layer by layer, becoming incredibly sluggish.

But he still did not release his five senses to check his injuries, focusing all his will on channeling the power within his Great Wasteland Divine Veins. A Divine Extinction eighth-level against a Divine Extinction sixth-level... even if he lost, he absolutely could not lose too disgracefully.

The myriad-layered, ripple-like destructive power annihilated everything within the barrier. The space of Eden Cloud Top, resilient as it was, actually showed faint signs of cracking. With the power completely flooding the battlefield, it made no difference where Shen Wuyi stood. When the destructive ripples touched the glazed ice crystal, they would suddenly part like a severed stream of water, flowing past on both sides.

An increasingly thick layer of ice spread across Dian Jiuzhi's body, and the color was rapidly draining from his face... At the same time, Shen Wuyi's glazed barrier finally lost its tranquility for the first time, showing faint cracks of ice. Though the cracks were minor, they were exceptionally conspicuous on the flawless ice crystal.

Shen Wuyi's expression remained unchanged, her icy eyes reflecting an even deeper, otherworldly light. Instantly, the cracks on the glazed ice crystal began to slowly mend at a visible rate... then they slowly spread again. In this back-and-forth, they seemed to reach a temporary equilibrium.

As the silver light dimmed once more, the tide of destruction began to recede. Dian Jiuzhi slowly raised his right arm, his movements clearly stiff. Yet, the not-yet-dissipated silver light suddenly flared, and as his right arm slammed toward the ground, his body, its previous momentum not yet spent, erupted once more with a destructive power no less than before.

"Myriad Manifestations... Eight Wastelands World Shatterer!"

In that instant, space trembled violently, and silver light illuminated the firmament as if heaven and earth had been inverted. Under the relentless onslaught of the Great Wasteland power, the ice cracks on the glazed barrier, which had almost vanished, suddenly expanded, covering more than half the barrier in a flash. Then, with unstoppable momentum, they slowly extended, gradually outlining the shape of the entire ice crystal.

One breath, two breaths, three breaths... four breaths... five breaths!!

Ping!

The silver light finally faded. And at the very moment the light was about to extinguish, the mysterious glazed barrier finally shattered. The last wisp of Great Wasteland power swept over Shen Wuyi, causing her indifferent, jade-like face to turn pale for an instant and a thin line of blood to trickle from the corner of her lips... but that was all.

In the next instant, her pupils seemed to have condensed the eternal, desolate cold of ages. Her left hand shot out the Heartbreak Thorn, carrying a colorless ice light. As it pierced the air, it bloomed with layers of ice petals. By the time it neared Dian Jiuzhi, it had transformed into a fully blossomed, dreamily beautiful ice crystal snow lotus.

BOOM—

The ice crystal snow lotus shattered against Dian Jiuzhi's body, scattering into a sky full of icy rain that refracted a magnificent, crystalline brilliance. Dian Jiuzhi, who was about to forcefully channel his Great Wasteland power again, froze instantly. The silver light he had been struggling to muster also froze in place, then vanished in an instant like a popped bubble.

His soul sea was a dead silence, sealed in ice. All his senses could touch was an endless cold. His will struggled with all its might, again and again... Finally, he let out a soft sigh.

"So be it..."

His five senses returned, and the chill assaulted his body. He fell backward stiffly like an unconscious ice sculpture, landing with a heavy thud.

The entire arena was deathly silent.

His flesh, marrow, and profound energy were all sealed, leaving him unable to feel pain or even the existence of his own body. Only his consciousness remained clear in a void of frozen nothingness.

But he did not choose to let his consciousness fade. Instead, he opened his stiff, cold lips and, with utmost clarity, enunciated each word: "I... con... cede."

"..." Shen Wuyi silently sheathed her Heartless Sword and Heartbreak Thorn. The faint trace of blood at the corner of her lips was also silently wiped away.

The Grand Divine Official's announcement followed: "Dian Jiuzhi of the Myriad Manifestations God Kingdom concedes. Shen Wuyi of the Eternal Night God Kingdom is the victor."

BOOM!

Dian Luohou could no longer hold back. With a thunderous explosion of air, he rushed into the barrier and helped up Dian Jiuzhi, whose entire body was encased in ice crystals. His thick profound energy washed over Dian Jiuzhi's body like a gentle tide, quickly dispelling the chill within him.

"Brother Jiuzhi!" Dian Sansi's face was pale. He took several steps forward, repeatedly resisting the urge to rush in after them.

Dian Jiuzhi had lost... defeated despite his absolute advantage in cultivation, age, and physique. It was a result that many could not have imagined even in their wildest dreams.

Dian Luohou's terrifying expression made it clear that Dian Jiuzhi had not only lost but was also severely injured.

However, while some sighed, no one sneered. Faced with Shen Wuyi's Exquisite Profound Realm and ice crystals, which completely defied common sense and shattered cognition, Dian Jiuzhi's defeat, though unexpected, was not unjust.

What was certain was that after this battle, the Abyss would no longer have a "Number One Divine Child." And the name of the Eternal Night Divine Maiden would be deeply seared into the memory and soul of everyone present, like a brand.

"Hahahahaha!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!"

A hoarse, crazed burst of laughter suddenly erupted, like countless poisoned steel needles stabbing viciously into everyone's eardrums, so piercing it made their souls tremble.

"Is this the so-called Number One Divine Child? Is this the so-called Great Wasteland Divine Veins?? A dignified eighth-level of the Divine Extinction Realm, defeated by my Eternal Night's Divine Maiden, who is only at the sixth level, looking like a frozen dead dog. What a colossal joke, hahahahahaha!"

No one would mock the Myriad Manifestations God Kingdom at a time like this, nor would any Divine Master utter such undignified, venomous words... except for the Wuming Divine Master of the Eternal Night God Kingdom. Her vicious mockery, it could be said, was not the least bit surprising.

Any other Divine Master would most likely have chosen restraint, rationally deciding not to stoop to the level of a madwoman. But this was, after all, the most volatile Jue Luo Divine Master.

Dian Luohou, helping Dian Jiuzhi up, whipped his head around, his voice as fierce as fire: "Shut up!!"

"Hahahahaha!"

Shen Wuyanye, however, continued to laugh, each cackle more soul-rending than the last. "What a Myriad Manifestations Divine Child. So certain of himself, so arrogant as to offer a ten-breath handicap. I thought he must have some great ability, but it turns out he's just a fragile, pathetic piece of trash."

"Dian Luohou, you raised such a disgrace to your kingdom and yourself, a good-for-nothing who's become a laughingstock for the world. What face do you have to shout at this venerable one!"

CRACK!!

The veins on Dian Luohou's arms bulged, and his eyes looked as if they would burst with fury... but this was the Pure Land, after all. Gritting his teeth, he forcibly suppressed his rage. The loser must calmly accept the humiliation... He had once taught Dian Jiuzhi this very lesson.

The Jue Luo Divine Master's forbearance did not earn him any restraint from the Wuming Divine Master. The dark palanquin she sat in suddenly moved slightly. A wisp of profound energy shot out, pierced through the barrier, and, under the shocked and bewildered gazes of everyone, mercilessly struck Shen Wuyi.

With a loud bang, Shen Wuyi was sent flying several hundred feet.

She did not make a sound, landing on her knees in a bow. "Wuyi was useless and has disappointed Mother God."

"..."

Yun Che's gaze turned instantly cold.

"So you know you're useless!"

Shen Wuyanye's voice was like the shriek of a vengeful ghost, making everyone's soul strings tremble. "To deal with a mere Dian Jiuzhi, an ignorant and arrogant piece of Myriad Manifestations trash, you actually took so long! And even sustained a minor injury! Do you know that even if he bled out all his foul, filthy blood, it wouldn't be as precious as a single drop of yours!"

Shen Wuyi lowered her head and replied, "Wuyi knows her mistake."

Around the palanquin, all the women of Eternal Night were silent, their expressions unchanging, as if they were long accustomed to this. Shock, confusion, and disbelief appeared on the faces of the others, before all turning into sighs of pity and regret.

If Shen Wuyi had appeared in any other god kingdom, she would have been cherished in every possible way, practically worshipped as a goddess.

But she just had to be in the Eternal Night God Kingdom... Her brilliance, so dazzling it stunned even the Divine Masters, would only become a tool for the madwoman Shen Wuyanye to wantonly vent her malice upon the world.

"You'd better know your mistake! In the next Divine Child battle, you will defeat all the other Divine Children by yourself within ten breaths! Let these self-proclaimed noble men know just how pitiful and lowly they are!"

"Yes!"

Shen Wuyi agreed without any hesitation. "If I cannot do it, I am willing to accept any punishment from Mother God."

The expressions of the Divine Masters shifted. The faces of those from the other five god kingdoms all turned ugly to varying degrees. While she was reprimanding and punishing Shen Wuyi, she was also viciously humiliating their five god kingdoms. Yet, fate had somehow favored this madwoman, favored the isolated Eternal Night God Kingdom.

This generation's Eternal Night Divine Maiden, her splendor completely overshadowed the former Number One Divine Child, Dian Jiuzhi, and undoubtedly overshadowed all the other Divine Inheritors as well.

The Abyssal Emperor floated in the air, silently observing everything. He offered no counsel, spoke no words, his expression as serene as an eternal, frozen peak. Only in the depths of his profound eyes was there a subtle light that no one could comprehend.
