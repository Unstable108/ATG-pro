“This poor girl, she's probably been ordered by that old hag to make an example out of you.”

Dian Luo Hou said flatly, “Go. There’s no need to show mercy to the girl under that old hag’s command.”

His calling Shen Wu Yi a “poor girl” sounded perfectly normal to anyone. To be a Divine Inheritor in other Divine Kingdoms was a lifelong honor and glory. But to be chosen as a Divine Inheritor by Shen Wu Yan Ye… one could only say how truly pitiful it was.

The previous Divine Maiden of the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom, Shen Wu Qing, always exuded a soul-piercing cold gloom whenever seen. Perhaps the only warmth she ever experienced in the mortal world came from Pan Bu Wang, who was arrogant, fearless, and “faced difficulties head-on” back then. Now, her body is not yet cold… Oh no, having committed a “colossal error” in Shen Wu Yan Ye’s eyes, yet refusing to admit fault until death, it’s still unknown if her remains are even intact.

Dian Jiu Zhi soared into the air, like a light feather, elegantly and gracefully descending into the barrier.

Although Dian Luo Hou had instructed him not to show mercy to the daughter of Eternal Night, his inherent cultivation still led him to give a slight bow: “Dian Jiu Zhi of Sen Luo Hall, it is a great honor to personally experience the demeanor of the new Divine Maiden of Eternal Night.”

Shen Wu Yi remained silent, only her jade wrist moved slightly. Clang! A crimson dark light flashed past, and in Shen Wu Yi’s hand, there was already a slender sword. Its hilt was black, its blade four feet long and also black, etched with dark crimson patterns. The crimson light faintly flickered and flowed, like pairs of silent blood-red eyes peering into the world from the dark night.

Meng Jian Xi whispered to Yun Che, “This sword is the God Child’s sword of the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom. Its original name was ‘Chi Tong’¹, but after Shen Wu Yan Ye became a Divine Venerable, she changed it to an unbearably vulgar name.”

“Jue Qing Sword².”

Yun Che: “…”

Meng Jian Xi strongly agreed with Yun Che’s speechless expression and continued, “The Eternal Night Divine Kingdom also has another God Child’s weapon, named ‘Xuan Kong Mu Yue’³. It’s a magnificent space-piercing thorn imbued with spatial power, but now Shen Wu Yan Ye has renamed it ‘Duan Xin Thorn’⁴.”

He shook his head, a look of regret on his face.

The Grand Divine Official raised his palm, and a bronze profound light shone within it: “Shen Wu Yi of Eternal Night, cultivation at Divine Extinction Realm⁵ Level Six. Dian Jiu Zhi of Sen Luo Hall, cultivation at Divine Extinction Realm Level Eight. In this battle, Dian Jiu Zhi must receive the Xuan Huang Seal⁶ to balance his profound energy realm to be equivalent to Shen Wu Yi’s.”

“Thank you, Grand Divine Official.” Dian Jiu Zhi turned and bowed.

However, a cold and indifferent voice suddenly sounded in his ear: “No need.”

Dian Jiu Zhi slightly turned his gaze, his expression becoming somewhat subtle. Everyone was stunned, then either chuckled softly or shook their heads speechlessly, while Dian Luo Hou, disregarding the occasion, burst out laughing directly.

“Hahahaha! This girl… interesting, hahahaha!”

“Hmm? What does this Divine Maiden of Eternal Night mean?”

Meng Jian Xi frowned deeply: “Is she trying to fight Dian Jiu Zhi without his realm suppressed? Does she know who she’s facing? Has she lost her mind?”

“…?” Yun Che’s brows furrowed in confusion, and he didn’t relax them for a long time.

After a brief moment of surprise, Dian Jiu Zhi neither mocked nor became annoyed. Instead, he calmly said, “The Divine Maiden of Eternal Night has long resided in the Divine Kingdom, and this is our first meeting today, so it’s natural that you know very little about me.”

“I am Dian Jiu Zhi, fifty-two Jia Zi⁷ old, with a cultivation of Divine Extinction Realm Level Eight. In terms of the profound way, I possess the foundation and cognitive advantage of fifty-one Jia Zi. Physically, I have the Great Desolate Divine Veins⁸, which are highly compatible with the Sen Luo Myriad Manifestations Art⁹ that I cultivate in Sen Luo.”

“In other words, even if my realm were suppressed to be equal, I would still hold a significant advantage in both the profound way and physical body… Oh, or perhaps it’s more accurate to say I’d be taking a great advantage¹⁰.”

He did not shy away from concealing it, informing Shen Wu Yi in detail and straightforwardly about the advantages he inherently possessed.

“Therefore, Divine Maiden of Eternal Night, please reconsider your words just now.”

However, Dian Jiu Zhi’s well-intentioned words did not stir Shen Wu Yi’s expression in the slightest. When she parted her lips, she uttered the same cold words as before: “I said, no need.”

The yellow light in the Grand Divine Official’s palm dissipated. He offered no further advice, stating in a deep voice, “Since that is the case, the Xuan Huang Seal will not be applied. Let the battle begin!”

As soon as the Grand Divine Official’s voice fell, there was no room for reversal… It seemed even the Grand Divine Official disliked the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom. Dian Jiu Zhi’s words, which he had intended to speak, were forced back down. Facing Shen Wu Yi, he sighed inwardly, placed his right hand behind his back, and then slowly raised his left hand.

“I hold advantages in age, realm, and physique; a victory would not be honorable¹¹. Compared to the outcome of this battle, I would rather personally experience and witness the extraordinary immortal grace of the Divine Maiden of Eternal Night, so as not to have made this trip in vain¹² and not to have wasted this battle¹³.”

“Then, the Divine Maiden of Eternal Night may attack first for ten breaths¹⁴. After ten breaths, I will switch from defense to offense.”

Ten breaths… In the Divine Extinction Realm, allowing an opponent to attack first for ten breaths was an incredibly exaggerated gesture of courtesy. If it weren’t for everyone in the Abyss knowing Dian Jiu Zhi’s character and his utterly sincere demeanor… if anyone else had said the same thing, it would only have been interpreted as thorough contempt.

“Hahahaha, excellent.”

Dian Luo Hou let out another loud laugh, then said to the junior beside him, “Jiu Zhi’s words not only show the grace of our Sen Luo, leaving no room for criticism¹⁵, but also thoroughly humiliate those women of Eternal Night, making even their excuses after defeat seem ugly.”

Dian San Si, however, said, “This child believes that Jiu Zhi’s words are precisely his intention. He wants the Divine Maiden of Eternal Night to fully display her grace during these ten breaths for the Abyss Emperor and everyone to see. Perhaps she can astonish everyone and make a name for herself in the Abyss, so that even if she loses, this trip to the Pure Land¹⁶ will not have been in vain.”

After speaking, he added, “Jiu Zhi has always been like this. Whether it’s someone he knows well or someone he meets for the first time, he habitually extends goodwill.”

His smile stiffened, and Dian Luo Hou shook his head: “Alas, this pedantic¹⁷ side of him is truly hard to change.”

Shen Wu Yi remained silent. The sword in her hand slowly rose, its tip pointing at Dian Jiu Zhi, who had one hand behind his back and had not drawn his weapon. The crimson marks on the sword’s body gradually took on a dangerous depth. At this moment, Yun Che’s gaze quietly shifted towards the black palanquin shrouded in cold silence and oppression. From beginning to end, Shen Wu Yan Ye showed no reaction whatsoever.

Even as everyone secretly chuckled and sneered, and Dian Luo Hou laughed unrestrainedly, Divine Venerable Wu Ming, with her legendary terrifying temperament, remained eerily silent. Yun Che was extremely clear about the concept of the Great Desolate Divine Veins. It brought far more than just physical might; it also granted profound energy that vastly surpassed ordinary people and was immensely powerful and profound, far beyond those of the same realm.

Even she… Divine Extinction Realm Level Six, could she truly defeat Dian Jiu Zhi, who was Divine Extinction Realm Level Eight and possessed the Great Desolate Divine Veins? The Grand Divine Official’s eyelids were slightly lowered, as if disdaining to properly watch the upcoming battle.

His understanding of the Great Desolate Divine Veins far surpassed Yun Che’s. The Divine Maiden of Eternal Night’s absurd words in the face of the Great Desolate Divine Veins were simply ludicrous.

At this moment, a faint, ethereal voice suddenly reached his ear: “Huang, observe this girl closely.”

“…!” The Grand Divine Official’s gaze suddenly solidified.

Clang! Shen Wu Yi made her move. The Jue Qing Sword drew an incredibly straight crimson line, carrying her figure directly towards Dian Jiu Zhi. But the next instant, this crimson line abruptly halted in front of Dian Jiu Zhi. Dian Jiu Zhi lightly pinched with two fingers, and between his fingers was the sword tip of the Jue Qing Sword, emitting a terrifying cold gleam.

Yet, it was simply frozen in mid-air, unable to advance another inch. Simultaneously frozen was Shen Wu Yi’s figure. Dian Jiu Zhi’s expression remained unchanged; there was no profound light on his two fingers holding the sword, nor any trace of injury or blood.

The young profound practitioners witnessing Dian Jiu Zhi’s power for the first time all let out exclamations of surprise. This was because the sword wielded by Shen Wu Yi carried the terrifying profound energy of Divine Extinction Realm Level Six.

Shen Wu Yi’s gaze remained unchanged. Her figure sharply turned, and the Jue Qing Sword drew a crimson crescent afterimage. The extremely piercing tearing sound seemed to cut through the space of Eden’s Cloud Peak. Clang!! With a soft chime, Dian Jiu Zhi’s left hand appeared before his forehead, his horizontally raised single finger tapping the sword tip. Without any other movement, it instantly erased the terrifying crimson mark.

Shen Wu Yi’s figure changed again, spinning and retreating like a startled swan’s shadow. The Jue Qing Sword suddenly blazed with crimson light, instantly unleashing dozens of sword marks. Each mark carried the unreserved, awe-inspiring profound energy of Divine Extinction Realm Level Six. The crimson marks, some like crescent moons, others like blood shadows, intertwined into a net, completely enveloping the space around Dian Jiu Zhi. That terrifying might caused the space to emit whimpering sounds, making the profound practitioners outside the barrier feel a chill run through their bodies.

However, Dian Jiu Zhi remained standing in place, not moving in the slightest, his expression as indifferent as before. His right hand was still behind his back; only his left hand created streaks of afterimages, his five fingers swift as illusions, yet showing no panic, maintaining elegance, moving through the sword shadows like a butterfly flitting among flowers.

Clink, clink, clink, clink… His fingers met the sword, producing a rapid, rain-like series of metallic clashes. Each sound precisely countered a sword shadow, and those terrifying crimson marks of profound energy all disintegrated at his fingertips. From beginning to end, let alone leaving a wound on him, not even a corner of his clothes was stirred.

Gasps of astonishment and inhaled breaths rose and fell throughout the venue.

“Hiss…”

Meng Jian Xi drew a long breath and exclaimed, “I previously thought that Shen Wu Yi’s Divine Extinction Realm Level Six cultivation was over ninety percent likely forced into existence under Divine Venerable Wu Ming’s terrifying obsession, merely superficial. But now, it seems she is a genuine Level Six Divine Extinction practitioner!”

“Even through the barrier, I felt as if those sword shadows were going to pierce my body.”

“In contrast… Dian Jiu Zhi’s terrifying level must be re-evaluated.”

Concealing the shock in his heart, Meng Jian Xi lowered his voice and said, “His Great Desolate Divine Veins have clearly undergone a higher degree of awakening not long ago… The power of Divine Extinction Realm Level Six is like that of a child before him.”

Yun Che did not respond, turning his gaze once more towards the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom. What he saw was still only a suffocating cold silence and indifference.

Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink… Shen Wu Yi’s attacks, one after another, wave after wave, were all, without exception, blocked by Dian Jiu Zhi with a single hand… Just as Meng Jian Xi said, it was like a powerful expert toying with a child. The immense disparity gradually made the spectators lose interest.

Xian Yue withdrew his gaze, constantly glancing behind him.

“No need to worry.”

Wu Shen Yue said, “Xing’er will return naturally once she has settled her affairs.”

Xian Yue regained his composure, thought for a moment, and couldn’t help but say, “Although Sha Xing and Pan Bu Wang have had a long-standing friendship, I always feel… as if some unknown grievances have occurred between them.”

The words “Mist Emperor” inexplicably appeared in his mind, but he quickly erased them, then asked, “Master, after today, will Pan Bu Wang regain his position as the God Child of Xiao Die?”

“Absolutely impossible.” Wu Shen Yue’s answer was identical to Meng Kong Chan’s response to Yun Che.

“Why?” Xian Yue was somewhat puzzled… He was puzzled by the words “absolutely impossible.”

Wu Shen Yue said faintly, “When things are done to an extreme, fear is inevitable. Since there is fear, they naturally won’t let it happen.”

Wu Shen Xing turned his gaze and explained, “Simply put, Pan Bu Zhuo acted too ruthlessly and absolutely. Besides not daring to kill Pan Bu Wang, he probably used every malicious method he could think of. If it were just one person, that would be one thing, but to pledge allegiance to this new God Child, many people, either willingly or unwillingly, became accomplices.”

“Among them, Divine Venerable Qi Heng, though merely ignoring and condoning, might have caused the greatest harm to Pan Bu Wang.”

“You also know the final outcome: if he hadn’t been expelled from the Dream Weaving Divine Kingdom, he would have been so desperate and broken that he would have chosen to self-destruct his soul.”

“So, for someone who was treated like that, forced to the brink of self-destruction… no matter how well he’s compensated, no matter how good he appears outwardly, who can truly believe that the resentment in his heart has genuinely dissipated?”

“Thus, if he were to return to the position of God Child, and after inheriting divine power in the future… the deeply hidden resentment would completely erupt without restraint. Perhaps the first one he’d crush to death would be Pan Yu Sheng.”

“…I see.”

Xian Yue seemed to understand.

“Although it’s impossible for him to become God Child again, next, Divine Venerable Qi Heng will certainly bring Pan Bu Wang back to the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom and then spare no effort to mend their relationship.”

Xian Yue thought for a moment and said, “Is it because of the Abyss Emperor, and… the fear that he might become an uncontrollable menace?”

“Those are indeed two of the reasons.”

Wu Shen Xing slightly narrowed his eyes: “There’s another, perhaps more important, reason…”

Wu Shen Yue said faintly, “Pan Yuan Duan Ye¹⁸, that is a Dark Soul Domain capable of eternal inheritance in the Xiao Die Divine Kingdom. And a perfect Dark Body… Tsk, if its mysteries could be unraveled, perhaps a method to achieve it could be found. Pan Yu Sheng’s heart is probably no longer here¹⁹; if not for the Abyss Emperor being present, he would have long wished he could immediately leave the Pure Land and personally bring Pan Bu Wang back.”

Zheng!! In the battlefield, a deafening spatial shriek suddenly rang out.

The Jue Qing Sword in Shen Wu Yi’s hand trembled violently. The crimson light converged, then slowly gathered into a crimson sword aura²⁰, condensed and substantial. Her body slightly turned, the slender sword blade bent like a bow, and then suddenly shot out. A crimson streak of light instantly appeared in the air, splitting the world in everyone’s eyes with incredible precision. This sword strike seemed to have poured out all of Shen Wu Yi’s strength.

Dian Jiu Zhi’s gaze finally showed an extremely slight change. He slightly raised his left arm, but this time, instead of his fingers meeting, his five fingers spread open, reaching straight for the oncoming crimson sword aura amidst astonished gazes.

Chichichichichichi— A terrifying tearing sound erupted in Dian Jiu Zhi’s palm, breaking open countless twisted, short red marks. Dian Jiu Zhi’s expression was calm. His five fingers slowly closed, and the red marks rapidly vanished and dispersed between his fingers, gradually leaving only faint residual light.

Chila!! Before the sword aura had fully dissipated, Shen Wu Yi’s figure suddenly appeared to the side. The sword gleam shining from the Jue Qing Sword in her hand was actually even stronger than the previous sword aura. This time, Dian Jiu Zhi finally moved. His body retreated, and his right hand, which had been behind his back, also reached out flatly. His movement seemed light and slow, yet he grasped the sword blade with incredible precision, and a flash of silver-white profound light instantly erupted from his body.

Boom!! With a loud bang, the sword aura and sword gleam instantly disintegrated. Dian Jiu Zhi’s body flipped backward, then, like a floating leaf in the wind²¹, he lightly landed on the ground.

In front of him, Shen Wu Yi instantly retreated several miles, only managing to stop her momentum when her long sword pierced the ground, cutting a hundred-zhang²² sword mark. Ten breaths had passed, and Dian Jiu Zhi was not harmed in the slightest. Thus, in everyone’s eyes, this battle would now conclude.

Dian Jiu Zhi lowered his head, glanced at his slightly disheveled clothes, and let out a heartfelt compliment: “To be honest, Divine Maiden of Eternal Night, I previously had doubts about your cultivation, thinking it was hastily achieved and thus unstable. I never expected to have misjudged to this extent; I am truly ashamed.”

“At the age of one Jia Zi, and at Divine Extinction Realm Level Six… my profound way talent is absolutely no match for the Divine Maiden of Eternal Night’s. If we were of the same age, I truly wouldn’t even have the slightest qualification to compare.”

“Alas.”

Dian Luo Hou covered his face and sighed heavily: “I told you there’s no need to be polite to the demoness of Eternal Night, alas, alas, alas!”

Dian San Si, however, had a look of respect and admiration: “Elder Brother Jiu Zhi’s character is like this; how could it vary depending on the person?”

Suddenly, his heart twitched, and his gaze uncontrollably shifted, glancing sideways in Yun Che’s direction. Such a good Elder Brother Jiu Zhi, to actually be… actually…

Dian Jiu Zhi’s words were undoubtedly a genuine compliment to Shen Wu Yi, and also gave her ample face²³, ensuring that even if she suffered a crushing defeat next, she would largely retain her dignity.

But, her response to him was Shen Wu Yi’s four words, as cold as ever: “Too much nonsense.”

Dian Jiu Zhi sighed softly, then smiled with relief. When he raised his hand again, white light was already flowing between his fingers. An invisible aura of power slowly spread. Ten breaths was the goodwill he extended to Shen Wu Yi, knowing he would surely win. Yet, he didn’t know that in Shen Wu Yi’s eyes, she disdained this “advantage” of him only defending for ten breaths.
