"I¹ last summoned you Divine Venerables² less than ten years ago. I believe you all already know the reason for this reunion." His voice was very soft, yet it seemed to resonate directly in the deepest parts of the soul, then clearly and irresistibly etched itself into the heart and spirit, never to be forgotten for all eternity.

He was clearly right before their eyes, yet he seemed to exist within an ancient painting, beyond the cloud peaks, at the end of a distant dream... It was a feeling of an "untouchable existence," originating from the depths of the soul, from cognition itself. Perhaps, as Li Suo³ had said, he was truly an existence that had completely transcended the existing planes. A true deity, different from the Divine Venerables who inherited the power of true gods. If one had to use words to interpret this untouchable, ethereal feeling, it might be the "divine bearing"⁴ and "divinity"⁵ that all beings knew, yet always remained beyond their comprehension.

"As you all know, during the last Void-breaking Ritual⁶, our thirty thousand and eleventh attempt, which carried the history, power, and will of our Abyss, we finally opened a spatial passage to the 'Eternal Pure Land'⁷."

"Stepping through this thirty thousand and eleventh spatial passage, our pioneers have successfully set foot in the 'Eternal Pure Land'." Although they had known this for a while, these words, spoken personally by the Abyss Emperor⁸, left no room for falsehood. For a moment, from the Divine Venerables of the Six Nations⁹ to the young profound practitioners, an unceasing surge of emotion rose in their hearts. They clearly understood what this meant. It would be a dramatic change in destiny, an eternal severance from the Nightmare Abyss Dust¹⁰, and the culmination of millions of years of effort in the Abyss, bearing a dream-like good fruit in their generation.

Especially Dragon Lord¹¹, Long Zhi Ming¹², his aged features trembled, his lips unconsciously opening and closing, his old eyes so blurry he could barely see. But facing the Abyss Emperor, no matter how their hearts stirred, not one of them uttered a disrespectful sound. Only their pupils glowed with a fiery intensity. The Abyss Emperor's sacred words settled the dust, proclaiming that the era of the Abyss would embark on a true turning point and rebirth. And what this "rebirth" would bring to the "Eternal Pure Land" — no one cared, no one pondered. Except for the Emperor of the "Eternal Pure Land" whom everyone saw, yet no one knew.

"Thirty thousand and eleven attempts, the efforts of generations of nations, and one hundred ninety-six thousand and fifty-seven pioneers who perished, have, at this moment, opened a new passage."

The Abyss Emperor raised his hand, his slightly open fingers seeming to cover the entire Abyss: "This glory and reward, this dawn from the 'Eternal Pure Land,' not only shines upon the Pure Land but will also bathe all of you present."

The sound of hearts beating grew more intense.

Dian Luo Hou¹³, who was least adept at controlling his emotions, was the first to be unable to suppress himself. He stepped forward, bowed, and asked, "May I ask, Abyss Emperor, does the next Void-breaking Ritual mean that we can enter the 'Eternal Pure Land'?"

The Abyss Emperor smiled: "Naturally."

These two short words were an undeniable divine proclamation to the world.

Dian Luo Hou asked again: "Then... when the spatial passage reopens, how many of us can enter at once?"

Everyone's spirits tensed up, and all eyes nervously focused on the Abyss Emperor. This was, without a doubt, their most pressing concern.

The Abyss Emperor's gaze shifted slightly. Instantly, everyone felt a gentle divine light from beyond the heavens brush over their bodies and souls: "For the Six Divine Nations, a thousand people from each nation may enter. For the Dragon Clan¹⁴, a hundred people may enter."

He did not mention the Pure Land, nor did he need to mention it to them. Dian Luo Hou suddenly looked up, momentarily unable to believe his ears. After the initial shock, an uncontrollable ecstasy surged onto everyone's faces. Even the expressions of the Divine Venerables of the various nations showed clear agitation. A thousand people... For the beings contained within a Divine Nation, this was a very small number, yet it far exceeded their expectations.

The Void-breaking Ritual, held once every fifty years, gathering the power of the Divine Nations and the Dragon Clan, had always opened spatial passages that could only accommodate a few individuals. The previous thirty thousand and eleven Void-breaking Rituals were all for scouting the way, so naturally, they didn't require full power. Now that the path was set, the spatial passage opened next time would certainly be incomparable to before, but they had never imagined it could be so many. This Pure Land Assembly¹⁵ allowed each Divine Nation to bring a hundred people.

They had initially thought this was a hint, informing them in advance that they could choose a hundred people to go to the Eternal Pure Land each time. But the result was that the Abyss Emperor gave them a huge surprise that far exceeded their expectations. Although a thousand people was a small number, for the core members of each Divine Nation, it was entirely sufficient. As long as the core remained, the Divine Nations could safely take root and continue in the Eternal Pure Land. The Void-breaking Ritual occurred once every fifty years, meaning each Divine Nation could migrate a thousand people every fifty years. Even if the Void-breaking Ritual continued indefinitely, a thousand years would be twenty thousand people, and ten thousand years would only be two hundred thousand people. But this was not important, because no matter the class or plane, no one cared about the sacrifice and abandonment of the weak. Even... compared to the strong who were less afraid of Abyss Dust, the weak needed and yearned for the "Eternal Pure Land" more.

Thump! Dragon Lord Long Zhi Ming knelt heavily to the ground, old tears streaming down his aged face: "This old man, Long Zhi Ming, along with the entire Dragon Clan, bows in gratitude for the Abyss Emperor's great kindness of rebirth!"

The erosion of Abyss Dust on the Beast Race¹⁶ was far greater than on humans. If they could go to, or return to, the "Eternal Pure Land" where their ancestors resided, the Dragon Clan would no longer need to despairingly await the fate of extinction, and would certainly, in some future era, return to being the venerated of all beings.

The "Eternal Pure Land"'s salvation for the Dragon Clan far surpassed that for the Human Race¹⁷. The Dragon Lord's inner excitement also far exceeded that of the Six Divine Nations.

"Dragon Lord, there's no need for such formality." The Abyss Emperor smiled faintly: "For today's outcome, the Dragon Clan also made indispensable contributions. There's no need to thank My Imperial Self."

As Yun Che¹⁸'s heart stirred, a warmth suddenly came from his shoulder.

Meng Kong Chan¹⁹'s hand gently pressed on his shoulder. He looked forward and softly said, "How fortunate I am as a father, to have been bathed in the blessings of my ancestors, and now to have my son²⁰ as a successor. Once I send my son to the Eternal Pure Land... this life will be enough for me, with no more regrets."

"..." Yun Che did not turn his gaze, and whispered, "I dare not speak lightly of the future. But... if I can safely set foot in the 'Eternal Pure Land,' I will surely protect everything I cherish there... at the cost of my body, at the cost of my soul."

The hand on Yun Che's shoulder gently patted him, and Meng Kong Chan smiled: "Well said. Even without using my divine soul, I can deeply feel the purity in your words. I believe that if it is you, my son, whether in the Abyss or the Eternal Pure Land, everything will go as desired."

"It will." Yun Che also smiled. In a corner behind the Star Moon Divine Nation²¹, Pan Bu Wang²², slowly raised his head. Unlike the excitement of others, there was still no light in his dark eyes. The Eternal Pure Land, huh... Heh... Mother, heartless... A place without you two, no matter how brilliant like a beautiful dream, is nothing but a hopeless abyss of death.

And this body of mine, existing only for revenge... how can I let you have your way! Pan Bu Zhuo²³, Shen Wu Yi²⁴... Before you set foot in your illusory "Eternal Pure Land," I will spare no cost to drag you into an abyss of death deeper, more painful, and more despairing than mine!

No one noticed that the Grand Divine Official²⁵ slightly turned his head at this moment, gazing at the Abyss Emperor's back... His eyes showed no change, and no one could capture or understand the ripples in the depths of his pupils, which connected millions of years of karma and resolve.

"I have another matter to announce to you all." The Abyss Emperor's voice rang out, instantly silencing all clamor once more.

"To activate a Void-breaking Grand Formation²⁶ capable of transporting thousands of people, the power required for the Void-breaking Ritual will far exceed previous times. This will require all Divine Nations to not stint on resources, and all Divine Venerables to not stint on divine power."

Hua Fu Chen²⁷ said, "This is a gift of destiny that will benefit our future generations for millennia. Even if we exhaust everything, we will gladly accept it. How can we be stingy?"

"Indeed." Meng Kong Chan immediately followed, "Just one word from the Abyss Emperor, and we will spare no effort."

All the Divine Venerables echoed their agreement. Facing the "Eternal Pure Land," there was simply no possibility of the Divine Nations and the Dragon Clan being stingy with either resources or power.

"It won't be quite that extreme." The Abyss Emperor seemed to smile, but his features appeared to have remained unchanged throughout: "To pave the way to the 'Eternal Pure Land,' the foundation of the Void-breaking Ritual's formation needs to be reshaped. This endeavor requires the combined power of all Divine Venerables."

"Divine Venerable Sen Luo Jue Luo²⁸, Divine Venerable Zhe Tian Hua Xin²⁹, Divine Venerable Zhi Meng Wu Meng³⁰, Divine Venerable Xing Yue Tian Xing³¹, and Divine Venerable Qiong Yue³², Divine Venerable Yong Ye Wu Ming³³, Divine Venerable Xiao Die Qi Heng³⁴, and Ancestral Dragon Lord Long Zhi Ming³⁵."

He called out the names of the seven Great Divine Venerables and the Dragon Lord one by one, his gaze sweeping over each of them: "Ten years from today, gather here to reshape the Void-breaking Grand Formation. No one may be absent."

His words were always like a gentle breeze, without even a hint of might or pressure. He was narrating, proclaiming... but the four words at the end, "No one may be absent," were an imperial decree. Absolutely not to be disobeyed!

The seven Divine Venerables and the Dragon Lord all straightened their countenances, bowing respectfully to receive the order: "We respectfully obey the Abyss Emperor's gracious command!"

Ten years later... reshaping the Void-breaking Grand Formation... Yun Che's expression remained unchanged as he deeply etched these words into his heart. According to the memories Chi Wu Yao³⁶ had extracted from Mo Bei Chen³⁷, the strange mirror the Abyss Emperor used to break open the Abyss passage would fall into slumber after each use, requiring fifty years to recover its power. And that strange mirror was most likely the spatial demonic artifact mentioned in Ni Xuan³⁸'s memory fragments, which fell into the Abyss with the daughter of Demon Emperor Pan Ming³⁹ — the Pan Ming Void-Breaking Mirror⁴⁰.

The names "Void-breaking Ritual" and "Void-breaking Grand Formation" undoubtedly further corroborated this greatest possibility. If all the known information and conjectures were true, then the Pan Ming Void-Breaking Mirror would awaken again in roughly forty-plus years. But reshaping the Void-breaking Grand Formation... why in ten years? Reshaping doesn't mean activating, but rather laying a new foundation for activation. Is that all there is to it...?

"Divine Venerable Hua Xin," the Abyss Emperor's gentle words floated over the Eden Cloud Summit⁴¹: "Over these ten thousand years, to save Cai Li⁴², you have repeatedly harmed yourself. Your lost lifespan has exceeded two hundred Jiazi cycles⁴³, and the divine power you bear has become increasingly incompatible with your body. The pain derived from it, only you know."

"...!" Hua Cai Li suddenly turned to look at her father, her jade-like countenance instantly turning pale.

"Father... Father God... you..." She knew that during her ten thousand years in the "cradle," her father endured immense pain each time he saved her. But she never knew, nor was she ever told, that what Hua Fu Chen endured was not just temporary pain, but such a massive loss of lifespan and body-devouring torment that could erupt at any moment. Hua Fu Chen, however, gave his daughter a gentle smile, reassuring her with his eyes that he was fine and safe.

"During these ten years, you must calm your mind and rest your body, and not use your divine power." Hua Fu Chen bowed in deference: "Yes. Ten years from now, Fu Chen will surely be in his most complete state."

The Abyss Emperor's gaze shifted slightly: "Divine Venerable Yong Ye⁴⁴, to bear divine power, your body and soul are both wounded, and your lifespan has been reduced by a massive seven-tenths. For you, passing on your divine power sooner is the best strategy."

"If you pass it on immediately, you can still retain two hundred Jiazi cycles of lifespan, and there's a possibility for your vision to recover. If you continue to forcibly bear the divine power, after forty Jiazi cycles⁴⁵, every day could be the day of your sudden death."

From behind the imperial sedan, Divine Venerable Wu Ming⁴⁶'s obscure voice came: "Thank you, Abyss Emperor, for your guidance. Shen Wu Yan Ye⁴⁷ has his own decision."

Everyone knew that Shen Wu Yan Ye was the least likely person to pass on his divine power prematurely... even if he was in unbearable pain, even if he suffered a heavy loss of lifespan. The Abyss Emperor only mentioned these two Divine Venerables and said no more.

"It seems that with the 'Eternal Pure Land' within reach, the Abyss Emperor is in an excellent mood," Meng Jian Xi⁴⁸ said with a light chuckle.

"How can you tell?" Yun Che asked, surprised.

Meng Jian Xi slightly adjusted his wording, conveying through soul sound⁴⁹: "In the history of the Divine Nations, the Abyss Emperor's presence has actually been extremely low. The Void-breaking Ritual, which gathers the power of all Divine Venerables once every fifty years, is almost the only interaction."

"Other than that, the Abyss Emperor never actively interferes with any matters of the Divine Nations, rarely even inquiring. For example, when such a drastic change occurred in the Eternal Night Divine Nation⁵⁰, the Abyss Emperor didn't even cast a glance... Perhaps the only exception was the Owl Butterfly Divine Nation⁵¹, but even that involved very little."

"And today, the Abyss Emperor actually gave admonitions and warnings in public." Meng Jian Xi smiled, his eyebrows raised: "I clearly saw the surprised looks on my uncle's⁵² faces just now. I imagine this is probably the first time they've witnessed such a thing."

"..." Yun Che looked straight ahead, offering no response. For some reason, Meng Jian Xi's casual remark made his heart inexplicably sink a little.
