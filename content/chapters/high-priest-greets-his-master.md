Hua Cai Li stepped forward, asking with full anticipation, "How is the taste? Did it make you~ submit~? Uncle Liu Xiao, you are the most esteemed God Official¹, you definitely can't be stubborn and speak falsely."

Liu Xiao God Official didn't speak. His old eyes slowly lost focus. Following that, his sparse hair gradually floated up at a visible rate, until each strand stood on end.

"Eh?" This strange phenomenon made Hua Cai Li's cherry lips part slightly in surprise.

Yun Che lightly tugged Hua Cai Li's sleeve, signaling her not to speak. But Hua Cai Li's soft, delicate fingers brushed his palm in return, subtly conveying intimacy to him right under a God Official's nose.

Liu Xiao God Official slowly closed his eyes, letting out a long, strange groan that trembled.

When he opened his eyes, his gaze was still fixed on the ice bowl in his hand. His old eyes seemed to be covered by a thin layer of icy mist, and he remained motionless for a long time, as if reluctant... or unable to take a second bite.

Because in his understanding of the culinary arts², this was a dream-like masterpiece, rarely seen in the world, that would be gone forever once consumed.

His old hand gently pushed, and the ice bowl was sealed by a thin layer of profound energy³. As he turned, his old eyes, fixed on Yun Che, shot out divine light so scorching it was terrifying.

"Boy, just who is your culinary Master? I've existed for millions of years, and I never knew there was such an old monster in this world!"

Yun Che quickly replied, "Replying to Senior⁴ Liu Xiao, my Master is a person from beyond this world, never wishing to be tainted by the mortal realm. Before his passing, he instructed this junior⁵ not to speak of him to anyone, so..."

"Alright, alright, then don't speak of it." Liu Xiao God Official waved a hand, showing no intention of forcing the issue. The divine light in his eyes, far from dimming, grew even stronger. "The old monster is gone, but there's still you, this little monster!"

Before his afterimage dissipated, Liu Xiao God Official's withered figure instantly appeared before Yun Che. An old hand gripped his arm with a speed Yun Che couldn't react to, as if afraid he would run away. His gaze was like a burning torch: "Boy, how are this 'Liu Xiao Scorns the Mortal Dust,' and the 'Colorful Cloud Soup' and 'Reflected Cloud Crisp' made?! Quickly teach me..."

"Ah!" Hua Cai Li exclaimed in surprise, hastily moving to pull Liu Xiao God Official's sleeve, unable to hide her urgency: "You... your movements are so big, don't accidentally hurt Brother Yun! And... and the culinary arts, just like profound cultivation⁶, have laws of inheritance. How can you easily teach them to others?"

Liu Xiao God Official's eyes widened, he swiftly withdrew his hand, then "slapped" his own old face.

"Right, right, right, right, right!" After slapping his own old face, Liu Xiao God Official paced in small, annoyed steps: "Look at me, in my excitement, I almost broke a taboo. Unacceptable, utterly unacceptable."

After turning in a circle, he suddenly thought of something. He looked up at Yun Che again, the excitement in his eyes completely transformed into fervor: "That's right! I can take you as my Master! That way, you can teach me!"

Before Yun Che and Hua Cai Li could react, he "whooshed" forward. This time, he used both hands, firmly grasping Yun Che's hands. The excitement and yearning on his old face almost materialized and overflowed: "Boy... bah! Little monster... tsk! Little Master⁷! I'll take you as my Master right now, you must accept me... Oh, right, the apprenticeship gift, the apprenticeship gift!"

As he spoke, his body quickly lowered, clearly intending to perform a kneeling bow.

This unexpected development left Hua Cai Li dumbfounded, then her face turned pale. She hastily tried to pull Liu Xiao God Official up, but then heard the whistling wind in her ears, accompanied by an extremely terrified roar:

"Master, you cannot!"

Yuan Ying God Attendant⁸, carrying a storm, rushed forward to Liu Xiao God Official in an extremely flustered and undignified posture, cushioning his knees with his own body, barely stopping him from bowing down.

"Master, you are a God Official of the Pure Land⁹! Throughout the heavens, only the supreme Abyss Emperor¹⁰ can make you bow your head. How can you perform such a grand ceremony to a junior from a God Realm? Absolutely not, absolutely not!"

He held up his hands, desperately supporting Liu Xiao God Official's upper body. As he howled, all decorum was lost, his head covered in sweat, only panic remaining.

Liu Xiao God Official rolled his eyes, and with a kick, sent Yuan Ying God Attendant flying.

One of the four esteemed God Attendants of the Pure Land, a proud existence with Divine Extreme Realm¹¹ cultivation, tumbled and flew out like a ball, letting out an even hoarser howl in mid-air: "Yun... X..."

Liu Xiao God Official didn't even glance sideways: "I hate it most when this brat spouts all this 'this can't be done, that can't be done' nonsense."

Bang!

Yuan Ying God Attendant burst through the wall and crashed onto the Pure Land's ground, who knows how far away.

Compared to Hua Cai Li's shock and Yuan Ying God Attendant's terror, Yun Che was surprisingly calm. Facing Liu Xiao God Official's gaze, which was so fervent it was almost out of control, he slowly said, "As the saying goes, 'In the Way, there is no precedence or hierarchy; the capable one is the teacher¹².' Senior Liu Xiao's knowledge is vast, and his insight is like a torch. Since he is willing to take this junior as his Master, it naturally proves that this junior indeed possesses the qualifications in the culinary arts."

Hua Cai Li's beautiful eyes widened, but she trusted Yun Che too much to interrupt.

Liu Xiao God Official's gaze brightened immensely, his features practically blooming like a withered flower: "Hahahaha! Well said, simply too well said! You brat... tsk! Look at my old mouth, Little Master is truly more pleasing to the eye the more I look. So, you are willing to accept this old man as your disciple?"

Yun Che shook his head: "I will not accept."

"Uh..." Liu Xiao God Official's voice and expression froze simultaneously.

Yun Che bowed respectfully and slowly said, "Senior Liu Xiao's uninhibited soul and unwavering dedication to the culinary arts are deeply admirable. However, Senior Liu Xiao, as a God Official of the Pure Land, possesses boundless nobility in his person and name. Yet, such nobility can sometimes become a restraint, just as now. If you, as a God Official, were to take a junior from a God Realm¹³ like me as your Master, it would undoubtedly harm the supreme dignity of the Pure Land. For this junior, and for the Dream Weaving God Realm¹⁴, it would be an immense honor, but even more so, an immense disaster."

"Therefore," Yun Che bowed slightly, "this junior is overwhelmed with trepidation by such an honor, but I humbly ask Senior Liu Xiao to withdraw this kindness."

"Yes, yes." Hua Cai Li's graceful figure flashed, and she stood beside Yun Che, echoing him: "If you really take Brother Yun as your Master, even if Uncle Abyss Emperor is gentle, he'll likely get angry, and Uncle Meng will be restless day and night. So, Uncle Liu Xiao just needs to admit defeat obediently, and forget about taking him as a Master."

"Besides, if Brother Yun became your Master, wouldn't his seniority suddenly be much higher than mine? I don't want that!"

She stood extremely close to Yun Che, their clothes almost touching, and spoke without any reservations.

Liu Xiao God Official twisted his mouth, then waved a hand, a muffled grumble escaping his lips: "Alright, alright, what kind of damn God Official is this, can't even take a Master... mumble... mumble... DE!"

Yuan Ying God Attendant, who had gotten up, let out a huge sigh of relief upon hearing this, then wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.

As Liu Xiao God Official's personal God Attendant, he knew Liu Xiao God Official's temperament better than anyone. He never cared for the status and prestige of a God Official, nor for any conventional etiquette of hierarchy. He acted and spoke purely on his own whims, completely disregarding the dignity of a God Official, and would suddenly do something astonishing.

Even so, today's incident still scared him so much that his liver and guts almost split, and his scalp was still tingling even now.

Hua Cai Li also secretly let out a breath, then said, "Then... Uncle Liu Xiao should admit defeat now, right!"

"Admit, admit, I'm completely convinced."

Liu Xiao God Official admitted without the slightest hesitation. After all, he had been so eager to take a Master regardless of his status, so it was more than just being convinced.

He leisurely glanced at Hua Cai Li: "Little girl, you specifically orchestrated this whole thing, and what you want this old man to agree to is to help you break off your engagement with that boy Dian Jiu Zhi?"

Hua Cai Li's phoenix eyes sparkled, and she said with full admiration, "Wow! As expected of Uncle Liu Xiao, I haven't even said a word, and you've already completely seen through it."

"Pah!" Liu Xiao God Official spat fiercely: "You little girl, weren't you deliberately making those little glances and gestures for me to see?! You didn't say a word, but your little thoughts were practically screaming in my face!!"

"N-no way." Hua Cai Li's beautiful, fairy-like face was full of innocence and docility: "It's just that a young girl with such shallow experience like me, no matter how much I try to hide it, I definitely can't hide it from Uncle Liu Xiao's eyes."

"Young girl? Hmm..."

Liu Xiao God Official squinted, grinning: "She was before. But look at the way you look at this boy, your eyes are practically spinning threads. I'm afraid you've already been fooling around with him for a while, and this little girl has long become a married woman."

Yun Che: "..."

Hua Cai Li's face instantly flushed crimson, and her body subconsciously retreated half a step: "Uncle Liu Xiao, you... are vulgar."

Liu Xiao God Official snorted through his nose: "If you did it, you did it, what's there to be afraid to admit? The affairs between men and women are nothing but two piles of rotting flesh entangled, truly vulgar and unbearable. How can it compare to even a bit of the elegance of fine food?"

"Senior... you are absolutely right." Yun Che felt a little embarrassed.

Liu Xiao God Official's gaze turned to Yun Che, his eyes still revealing his reluctance at not being able to take him as a Master: "You brat... you're called Yun Che, and you're also that 'Meng Jian Yuan' from the Dream Weaving God Realm who 'died and returned¹⁵'?"

Hua Cai Li offered a timely compliment: "As expected of Uncle Liu Xiao, you knew right away..."

"Go, go, go, go!! In the past two years, who else with the surname Yun is famous besides Yun Che of the Dream Weaving God Realm! 'Died and returned,' 'perfect divine soul¹⁶,' even this old man who hasn't stepped out of the Pure Land for eighty thousand years has heard it more than eight times."

"However," Liu Xiao God Official's tone shifted, and his gaze became a bit more leisurely: "Although Cai Li's stunt was audacious, her taste is quite good. This boy... aside from not having fully matured yet, he truly surpasses Dian Jiu Zhi in all aspects. Hmm... and his culinary skill is eight million times better than that boy's father!"

This was undoubtedly the most pleasant sound Hua Cai Li had heard from Liu Xiao God Official today. Half joyful, half eager, she said, "So, Uncle Liu Xiao will definitely help us achieve our goal, right?"

"Achieve your goal?" Liu Xiao God Official half-turned, carefully placing the bowl of 'Liu Xiao Scorns the Mortal Dust,' from which he had taken a single sip, into his spatial ring¹⁷. "I admit defeat. When it's time to help, I will certainly help. It's just that the scope of this matter is so vast, I'm afraid you, little girl, only know about a third of it at most."

"And even if you only know a third, I estimate you'd only dare to speak openly about it with an old man like me. As for 'achieving your goal,' I don't have that kind of ability."

"It's alright." Hua Cai Li, however, smiled with exceptional joy: "That Uncle Liu Xiao is willing to help, Cai Li is already extremely fortunate and grateful."

"This junior is endlessly grateful." Yun Che bowed in salute.

Liu Xiao God Official opened his mouth, as if to speak, but after a slightly complex change in his eyes, he merely waved his hand and turned his back, saying, "Alright, your goal has been achieved. Go on, go on."

His mind was still full of the 'Liu Xiao Scorns the Mortal Dust,' eager to try and recreate it based on Yun Che's ingredients and vague techniques he remembered.

Their trip had achieved its desired outcome, and both Yun Che's performance and Liu Xiao God Official's astonishment far exceeded expectations.

Hua Cai Li naturally had no reason to stay any longer, and quickly responded, "Okay, then we won't disturb Uncle Liu Xiao anymore. After we have an audience with Uncle Abyss Emperor, my brother and I will come to see you again."

Yun Che, however, suddenly spoke: "Senior Liu Xiao, may this junior be allowed to stay a moment longer?"

"Hmm??" Liu Xiao God Official glanced sideways, but didn't refuse.

Yun Che said no more. Under their gazes, he took out a jade slip¹⁸, his fingers imbued with profound light, and quickly etched upon it.

In the silence, only the swirling profound light was seen, and only the sound of carving was heard.

After a long while, Yun Che stopped, closed the jade slip, and respectfully presented it to Liu Xiao God Official: "This junior's visit this time was without a prepared gift, which makes me quite uneasy. I offer this as compensation, and hope Senior will not disdain it."

Liu Xiao God Official's old eyes flickered, a hidden guess forming in his heart. He unceremoniously snatched the jade slip, his gaze sweeping over it. In an instant, his body trembled, then he actually bounced three feet into the air: "This... this, this, this, this..."

Yun Che said unhurriedly, "Senior, rest assured, these recipes... including 'Four-Colored Cloud Soup' and 'Liu Xiao Scorns the Mortal Dust,' were not taught by my Master. They are all original creations of this junior and absolutely do not involve any inheritance taboos."

"I shall not disturb you further. This junior takes his leave."

The number of recipes carved onto that jade slip amounted to a full two hundred.

In the eyes of ordinary people, this might be dismissed as unworthy of a glance. But for Liu Xiao God Official... especially after witnessing Yun Che's culinary mastery, it was absolutely a treasure among treasures.

"Wait!"

This time, it was Liu Xiao God Official who called out to him. The small jade slip was held by both of the God Official's hands, his withered fingers trembling slightly: "Young Yun, what do you want to exchange for this item from me?"
