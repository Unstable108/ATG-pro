Shen Wu Yi, using the recoil force, abruptly halted her floating figure in mid-air. Her waist twisted like a willow branch, and the Heartless Sword¹, wrapped in dark red profound light resembling congealed blood, shot like a ghostly streak of light directly towards Dian Jiu Zhi’s² nape. Dian Jiu Zhi instinctively spun around, his hand sweeping upwards. A silver Destroying Domain³ instantly unfurled, enveloping the space where Shen Wu Yi was, like a collapsing sky. The moment a muffled explosion erupted, he watched as that figure and aura were swallowed by the power of destruction… yet, in the very same instant, a bone-chilling coldness touched his left neck.

Clang!

Although Dian Jiu Zhi had not used his full strength when he struck, he was still in a state where he had just attacked and his follow-up power had not yet manifested. This sword, despite being obstructed by his protective profound energy, still lightly grazed his skin, drawing a string of flying blood beads that arced finely in the air. The moment Dian Jiu Zhi’s gaze hastily turned, he saw a drop of crimson blood and the dark red long sword piercing his left neck.

Dian Jiu Zhi, after all, possessed fifty-two jia zi⁴ of experience, and his body had long developed sufficient profound way⁵ instincts. The moment his spiritual perception⁶ re-locked onto Shen Wu Yi, his body and power reacted almost instantaneously, even before his thoughts. His left arm grabbed the sword in a backhand motion, his right arm moved his body, and a palm struck upwards.

Boom!

The Sen Luo Power⁷ was, without a doubt, utterly domineering.

With a palm strike that had almost no build-up, it nevertheless produced a thunderous roar, instantly shaking away Shen Wu Yi and the Heartless Sword… scattering them into countless afterimages across the sky.

“……!?”

Dian Jiu Zhi’s pupils visibly contracted. A familiar cold sensation abruptly appeared behind him, less than a foot from his back, and his recently twisted body didn't even have time for an instinctive dodge or defense.

Hiss!

With a tearing sound, Dian Jiu Zhi’s pristine white God Child’s⁸ robes were cut open, revealing a nearly foot-long red mark on his back, almost drawing blood. Dian Jiu Zhi’s consciousness went blank for a moment, as if struck by a phantom that shouldn't exist. He had vast experience, countless battles, had visited the Mist Sea dozens of times, and had witnessed various swift or bizarre movement techniques of the Abyss.

However, no matter how powerful a movement technique, it always required profound energy to activate and always left traces. Similarly, no matter how profound a movement technique, there would always be a brief or prolonged pause after an instant shift. If not handled properly, or if anticipated by the opponent, it could even present a significant opening. Yet, Shen Wu Yi’s several instant shifts… had no aura, no pause! While his mind was blank, Shen Wu Yi had already stabbed him between the eyebrows. He staggered backward, a faint blood mark sliding down his forehead.

The intense pain brought him back to his senses. As his gaze refocused, Shen Wu Yi’s ice-like eyes were once again close at hand.

Clap!

Dian Jiu Zhi’s palm grabbed empty air. The sword shadow, which had been in front and to his left, appeared again, bizarrely, behind him and to his right, striking his side face like a whip. This sword still couldn't inflict a serious injury on him, but it was incredibly loud, like a tremendously heavy slap, delivered under everyone's gaze to the First God Child’s face, which was clearly filled with shock and bewilderment.

Previously, during the ten breaths he had conceded, he had calmly received all of Shen Wu Yi’s storm-like attacks without a scratch, appearing powerful, majestic, and elegant. But after those ten breaths, Shen Wu Yi had made seven sword strikes… all seven hit their mark. Amidst the sharp pain, he clearly realized that during the previous ten breaths, he had only defended and not attacked, and Shen Wu Yi had been striking casually, completely disregarding his concession.

Dian Jiu Zhi was not the only one utterly astonished; outside the barrier, there was a shocking silence. All the powerful experts stood frozen, as if their souls had departed.

“No more luck.”

Meng Kong Chan⁹ said in a relatively calm voice, “Indeed… it’s the Exquisite Profound Realm¹⁰.” He now understood why Shen Wu Yan Ye had hidden Shen Wu Yi so thoroughly, keeping her appearance unseen by outsiders for twenty whole years. It turned out… once this woman revealed her true form, she would surely shock the world, even surpassing Pan Bu Wang’s¹¹ “Child of Darkness¹²,” which had even caught the attention of the Abyss Emperor¹³.

By this point, Meng Jian Xi¹⁴ had begun to grasp a thing or two. He asked in surprise, “Her body transformations aren’t movement techniques at all, but… spatial shifts achieved through the Exquisite Profound Realm?”

Meng Kong Chan replied, “Touching one Exquisite Profound Realm allows for instantaneous transfer to one of the other six Exquisite Profound Realms. Seven layers of Exquisite Profound Realms are equivalent to… seven portable spaces that can be instantly shifted between!” In common understanding, the sole purpose of a portable space is storage. Even powerful God Venerables¹⁵ had never imagined it could be used for spatial jumps.

“Spatial power is the most difficult to control. Yet she wields it so freely, as if extending her seven fingers.” Meng Kong Chan continued, “Most astonishingly, once these seven Exquisite Profound Realms are hidden, only she herself can know of their existence. Even I, despite her repeated spatial shifts, cannot perceive any trace of the Exquisite Profound Realms.” Meng Kong Chan exhaled slowly, sighing, “I never thought that among this younger generation, besides Yuan’er, someone could open my eyes so much.”

Meng Jian Xi murmured, “So, can it be understood that Dian Jiu Zhi is facing one Shen Wu Yi, but it’s like dealing with seven Shen Wu Yis simultaneously?”

“No,” Yun Che’s¹⁶ gaze followed Shen Wu Yi, and he didn’t look away as he spoke: “When facing seven opponents, the auras and positions of all seven are within one’s perception. But her… all actions are unpredictable; no amount of profound combat experience or wisdom is of any use.”

Even God Venerable Wu Meng was astonished to this extent, let alone others. Dian Jiu Zhi’s discomfiture was evident to all, but no one mocked him. Dian Luo Hou’s¹⁷ brows furrowed tightly, his eyes filled with surprise, but his aura remained steady.

Shen Wu Yi’s incredibly bizarre spatial shifts completely defied intuition and common sense. Not to mention Dian Jiu Zhi, even God Venerable Jue Luo would surely be bewildered for a long time when first facing it. But he also believed that after the initial shock and confusion, Dian Jiu Zhi would quickly find the most suitable countermeasure… and this countermeasure happened to be his most proficient area.

“Exquisite Profound Realm, spatial… shifts?” Hua Cai Li¹⁸ murmured the completely unfamiliar concept, her beautiful face still showing lingering surprise. Hua Fu Chen¹⁹ sighed, “Let alone you, even I have never seen such a thing in my life.”

“Then… in that case, is it really possible for this Shen Wu Yi to defeat the Sen Luo God Child?” Hua Cai Li’s words betrayed her expectation. Hua Fu Chen, naturally knowing her thoughts, slowly shook his head: “If they were at the same realm, even if Dian Jiu Zhi had the absolute advantage of Divine Veins, physique, and profound way understanding, he would almost certainly not be Shen Wu Yi’s opponent.” He said “almost certainly not,” rather than “absolutely not,” because he also knew the power of the Great Desolation Divine Veins²⁰.

“But the chasm between realms is insurmountable, plus the battlefield is limited to ten thousand feet.” Hua Fu Chen gave a conclusion that was unquestionable in his God Venerable’s understanding: “Dian Jiu Zhi only needs one method, and Shen Wu Yi will surely lose.”

“That is to ignore all of Shen Wu Yi’s actions and break all techniques with sheer force!” Hua Cai Li seemed to understand, and the expectation in her eyes immediately faded. Her gaze involuntarily shifted to Yun Che again… Previously, Yun Che would always immediately sense her gaze, either looking back at her instantly or curving his lips slightly, each time making her happy and her heart flutter for a long time. But this time, Yun Che in her sight was gazing at the battlefield, at the Eternal Night Goddess whose beauty could overturn worlds and whose posture was like a demon, his eyes so focused, closely following her every movement, as if afraid to miss even a moment of her grace… His eyes were still the familiar clear ones, but for some reason, Hua Cai Li felt as if there was an invisible mist hidden within them, making his gaze appear dazed and hazy, no longer able to accommodate any other scenery… and he didn’t sense her lingering gaze for a long time.

“……”

Hua Cai Li was momentarily stunned, no longer caring about the battle, a very unfamiliar sense of unease and emptiness quickly rising in her heart.

“Moreover, Shen Wu Yi’s control over the Exquisite Profound Realm seems effortless, but it might not be that easy.” Hua Fu Chen observed the battlefield, his sword-like gaze clear on everything: “After several consecutive spatial shifts, Shen Wu Yi’s aura showed a relatively obvious weakening. After all, it is spatial power; maintaining the existence of the Exquisite Profound Realm naturally comes with a huge consumption.”

“But no matter the outcome, this battle… especially the appearance of the Exquisite Profound Realm, will surely be recorded in the annals of the Abyss.”

Clang!

Just as Hua Fu Chen finished speaking, a deafening clang echoed from within the barrier. After being hit seventeen times, Dian Jiu Zhi finally fully recovered from his dazed state. A thick, crystal-like profound light surged three feet around him, and the Heartless Sword, barely two feet away, was heavily repelled, sending Shen Wu Yi’s figure flying back. She then stopped mid-air, no longer attacking.

Dian Jiu Zhi’s white robes were torn in several places, his exposed skin marked with deep and shallow wounds, and even his face was crisscrossed with several blood trails. But at this moment, his eyes were exceptionally calm and cold. He had forcibly cast aside the panic and helplessness brought by the incomprehensible Exquisite Profound Realm, and also all traces of disdain, gentleness, and warmth. The Great Desolation Power²¹, now unleashed without reservation, made the space subtly tremble. Dian Luo Hou’s expression remained unchanged, his slightly tensed body completely relaxed.

“Such a movement technique, unseen and unheard of, truly an eye-opener.” He spoke, his voice different from usual, carrying a terrifying might: “If we were in the same realm, I might easily lose. But this time… it can only be an unfair victory!”

His current demeanor and spiritual pressure, even with bloodstains and blood beads on his face, did not diminish the prestige of the First God Child. As his words fell, he struck decisively, disregarding the immense consumption of profound energy. The Great Desolation Power, like a giant wave swept by a storm, instantly covered the sky and obscured the sun, engulfing the ten thousand feet of space before him. Undoubtedly… breaking all techniques with sheer force!

Shen Wu Yi used her sword to defend, changing from offense to defense, but the Great Desolation Power was too formidable. Her figure, like a lone boat in a raging sea, was instantly sent flying a thousand feet away before she could barely stabilize herself, but she was still rapidly forced back. It wasn’t until she was pushed to within a hundred feet of the barrier’s edge that she had enough strength to act. The Severing Emotion Thorn²² in her left hand suddenly flew out, shooting against the Great Desolation Power towards Dian Jiu Zhi’s glabella, creating a piercing, heart-stopping shriek wherever it went. The Great Desolation Power could not completely stop the Severing Emotion Thorn, but it did reduce its speed and momentum layer by layer. Dian Jiu Zhi did not withdraw his power to defend; instead, he tapped his foot and casually shifted ten body-lengths to the side, his peripheral vision catching the Severing Emotion Thorn following its original trajectory towards the spot he had occupied a moment ago. But just as it was about to “touch,” it suddenly vanished from his peripheral vision.

Dian Jiu Zhi’s pupils contracted slightly, and the dangerous shriek was already at his ear.

Bang!!

Blood splattered, even carrying large chunks of flesh. The strangely “vanished” Severing Emotion Thorn had fiercely pierced Dian Jiu Zhi’s undefended back, embedding itself in his spine.

“What…?!?”

Dian Luo Hou, who had just relaxed for half a breath, blurted out, his eyes widening almost to the point of bursting. That was the Severing Emotion Thorn, a God Child’s weapon, could it also undergo spatial shifts through Shen Wu Yi’s Exquisite Profound Realm!? This scene not only shocked the various God Venerables, but even the Grand Official’s²³ eyebrows visibly twitched.

The previously suppressed astonishment surged again, and in that moment of distraction, his vision suddenly blurred. Shen Wu Yi, who had been forced back several thousand feet, suddenly appeared before him, stabbing at his heart.

Clang!!

Dian Jiu Zhi’s back was undefended, but his front was full of power. Shen Wu Yi’s sword strike caused a deafening clang, the Heartless Sword bending into a crescent moon under the immense recoil.

The intense pain stimulated his soul, allowing Dian Jiu Zhi to regain his composure extremely quickly this time. He bit his teeth slightly, muttering softly: “Sen Luo Myriad Forms²⁴… Mastery of All Weapons²⁵… Hmph!!” A rich silver glow erupted from him, blazing like burning silver flames. With the movement of his arm, the silver glow transformed into a thousand-foot-long greatsword, slashing horizontally across the space before him.

Boom—

The thousand-foot greatsword, however, unleashed a ten-thousand-foot sword aura, completely engulfing the space within the barrier. If not for the Grand Official’s barrier, it might have been enough to cleave half of Eden Cloud Peak²⁶.

Shen Wu Yi’s figure vanished, instantly reappearing a thousand feet above. The Severing Emotion Thorn had also returned to her hand, shooting out again. One thorn and one person, one after another, attacked Dian Jiu Zhi with unpredictable trajectories. But Dian Jiu Zhi directly closed his eyes, even concentrating his spiritual perception within himself, no longer sensing Shen Wu Yi’s aura. Only his hand gestures changed slightly, the silver glow transforming from a greatsword into a massive halberd, crashing down from the sky. The impending Great Desolation Power would completely engulf the entire battlefield, leaving no blind spots… including himself. Trading force for force, trading injury for injury… with an absolute advantage in realm and physique, and a confined space of only ten thousand feet, he had no possibility of losing.

“……”

Yun Che’s fingers clenched tightly.

“Indeed, it’s an unfair victory,” Meng Kong Chan sighed. “But it is also the best method.”

Shen Wu Yi’s momentum abruptly stopped. She instantly realized that this was a power explosion covering the entire barrier. Even with many Exquisite Profound Realms, she couldn’t find a safe space within this ten-thousand-foot limited battlefield.

Boom!

!!!

Silver light illuminated the sky, and space trembled violently. This was the Great Desolation Power from the Abyss’s First God Child, the most domineering and peerless power in the Abyss. Everyone knew the names of Dian Jiu Zhi and the Great Desolation Divine Veins, but few had truly witnessed or experienced his unreserved Great Desolation Power. All the profound practitioners were horrified, and those God Realm experts at the same Divine Annihilation Realm, Eighth Level, were even more astonished, unable to believe that this was power from the same realm.

“This… isn’t it a bit too brutal?” Xian Yue²⁷ couldn’t help but whisper, “Shen Wu Yi is, after all, two realms weaker than him. Such an explosion might directly cause severe… huh?” Xian Yue’s voice suddenly stopped. He looked up at the sky, stunned for a long time. The silver light gradually faded, and Dian Jiu Zhi’s raised arm slowly retracted… but it suddenly stiffened halfway, and his closed eyes snapped open, looking up at the sky. The black figure floated high above, robes fluttering, a pair of beautiful eyes looking down, like solidified ice, cold and indifferent as before.

Completely unharmed. Even with Dian Jiu Zhi’s strong mental defenses, he was once again utterly bewildered on the spot. Outside the barrier, everyone was in a state of shock and confusion.

Anyone could see that, facing the Exquisite Profound Realm which defied common sense, Dian Jiu Zhi had held almost nothing back in this attack… The Great Desolation Power, how formidable, how terrifying. Under such power, even if Shen Wu Yi had used all her strength to resist immediately, she would have been injured… possibly even severely. But no matter what, it was impossible for her to be completely unharmed like this. Yun Che looked up at the immortal figure high in the sky, his gaze momentarily blurred. And as he returned from his daze to clarity, he caught a glint of light refracting from half a foot in front of Shen Wu Yi. Was that… an ice gleam?

“……”

The Grand Official’s body stiffened for a moment. Though only for an instant, it caused a violent shock in Dong Huang’s²⁸ heart behind him, making him suddenly look up.

“Master, what’s wrong??”

A terrifying silence… After several breaths, the Grand Official slowly uttered four words: “Glazed Ice²⁹.”

“…?”

Dong Huang was puzzled. The Grand Official, who never looked up to any living being in the world except the Abyss Emperor, actually took the initiative to raise his head, staring at the woman’s figure high in the sky.

“Exquisite Profound Realm… Glazed Ice…”

“This woman is actually… Ice Heart Nine Profundities³⁰!”

“Ice Heart… Nine Profundities?” Dong Huang was even more confused.
