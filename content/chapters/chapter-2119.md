Above the Pure Land, the Star Moon Divine Realm had also arrived.

Within the ranks of the Star Moon Divine Realm, Pan Buwang's presence seemed out of place. His situation was undoubtedly awkward, especially with the young Star Moon disciples, whose gazes towards him were extremely unfriendly.

Upon arriving in the Pure Land, Cha Xing appropriately pulled Pan Buwang aside.

"Brother Buwang, how does it feel to revisit the Pure Land?"

Pan Buwang looked ahead and said, "Everything in the Pure Land seems eternally unchanging. Looking around now, I'm shocked to realize that the most unfamiliar thing in this world is myself."

"Oh?" Cha Xing was somewhat surprised by his sentiment.

Pan Buwang smiled, "Just some idle musings, Star God Child, don't mind it. Your assistance today must have met with considerable resistance. This favor, I, Pan..."

"Stop right there!" Cha Xing interrupted him. "I'm also repaying a favor, no need for extra words. If you're truly grateful, you might as well reveal something to me... about your relationship with 'him'."

Pan Buwang's expression remained unchanged. "Externally, there's no relationship. Privately, it's like yours, a relationship between a benefactor and a beneficiary."

Cha Xing pursed his lips. "Fine, forget I asked." He glanced sideways, staring deeply at Pan Buwang. "Brother Buwang, you've changed a lot. So much so that I feel a bit unfamiliar, but also more curious. What exactly are you doing, going through all this trouble to come to the Pure Land?"

He didn't press further, only saying meaningfully, "I'll be watching."

The air suddenly turned cold, and even the light dimmed slightly.

This was the approach of a dark aura.

Cha Xing and Pan Buwang stopped simultaneously.

Ahead, Divine Venerable Qiheng, Pan Yusheng, was in the lead, with Owl Butterfly God Child Pan Buzhuo at his side. The Owl Butterfly Divine Realm's group, led by three Pure Land Divine Guards, was slowly approaching them.

Divine Venerable Qiheng's senses were sharp; he had long since noticed Pan Buwang's presence but didn't even glance at him, as if he hadn't seen him at all.

Cha Xing quickly saluted, "Cha Xing of the Star Moon Divine Realm greets Divine Venerable Qiheng and all the seniors."

Pan Buwang also bowed slightly, lowering his head and softly calling out, "Father God."

"Hmm." Pan Yusheng nodded slightly to Cha Xing but ignored Pan Buwang... When Pan Buwang respectfully saluted him, a flicker of surprise flashed in his eyes, but it was gone in an instant.

In recent years, when Pan Buwang faced him, there was only anger, disappointment, frantic screams, and even senseless mockery, without a trace of respect... But now, he saluted so respectfully, and the words "Father God" carried a long-lost, almost unfamiliar reverence.

However, this touch was only momentary. He had long been disappointed to the point of giving up on Pan Buwang, even personally declaring him abandoned, regardless of life or death.

As they were about to pass each other, Pan Buzhuo stopped, looking Pan Buwang up and down with interest.

"Yo! Isn't this the stray dog who howled and fled from my Owl Butterfly? I heard you wanted to enter the Dream Weaver's Sunken Dream Valley but were kicked out. Ha! You were once an Owl Butterfly God Child, yet you willingly became a drunken, dreaming waste! It's one thing to embarrass yourself, but if the Dream Weaver hadn't thrown you out, you almost dragged down the reputation of my Owl Butterfly Divine Realm!"

Pan Buwang didn't say a word.

"Oh? Your cultivation has actually improved?" Pan Buzhuo seemed surprised, then sneered, "Could it be that you've changed after these years in the Fog Sea? Did you come to the Pure Land with ulterior motives, hoping to prove yourself before the Abyss Emperor and have Father God accept you again?"

Pan Buzhuo gave a rather malicious smile, lowering his voice, "You embarrassing thing, stop daydreaming. You're only fit to rot outside like a wild dog. I can already smell the pitiful stench of decay on you."

"... " Pan Buwang still kept his head down, not saying a word, making it hard to discern any change in his expression.

"Brother Buzhuo," Cha Xing said coldly, "Don't lose the demeanor of a God Child."

Pan Buzhuo withdrew his mocking smile and said to Cha Xing, "Pan Buwang achieved nothing as a God Child and has repeatedly damaged my Owl Butterfly's reputation in recent years. Seeing him today, I couldn't suppress my harsh words. I hope the Star God Child will forgive me."

He smiled faintly and walked away, but his undisguised mocking voice continued, "Star God Child, your status is noble. It's better to stay away from such filthy things, lest you be tainted by bad luck."

Pan Yusheng, walking at the front, didn't turn back, nor did he stop or reprimand Pan Buzhuo. The gazes of the Owl Butterfly Divine Realm's people towards Pan Buwang were mostly indifferent or pitying... The last time he came to the Pure Land, Pan Buwang was still the center of their attention.

After they had walked far away, Cha Xing frowned, saying resentfully, "This Pan Buzhuo is really too much!"

Pan Buwang said expressionlessly, "After his mother came to power, she secretly harmed my mother... So, he and I are destined to be irreconcilable. During his years as God Child, his open and hidden suppression and torture of me... the cruelty of his methods is beyond your imagination."

"If not for my agreement with Wuqing, I wouldn't have been able to endure those years."

These words reached Cha Xing's ears, but he didn't sense a clear enough hatred, which made him secretly alarmed.

He patted Pan Buwang's shoulder, saying seriously, "Just wait, before the Abyss Emperor, I will definitely thwart him! Not just to vent for you, but because that Pan Buzhuo is simply repulsive."

"Good." Pan Buwang smiled faintly, his eyes a dark abyss that Cha Xing couldn't fathom. "I look forward to witnessing the Star God Child's Heavenly Wolf divine might again."

A buzzing sound came from afar.

The Pure Land's light barrier opened again.

"It seems the Eternal Night Divine Realm has also arrived."

As he spoke, Cha Xing looked sideways at Pan Buwang... The hatred and killing intent he had just shown for a few moments were too strong to ignore.

He had been unmoved by Pan Buzhuo's wanton mockery and provocation, but now, just hearing the words "Eternal Night," his killing intent instantly went out of control.

Cha Xing looked into the distance, saying expectantly, "The Eternal Night Divine Realm's new Goddess, Shen Wuyi, I can finally see her true face. The Eternal Night Divine Realm has hidden her so well, I hope she won't disappoint."

Boom!!

Yun Che and Hua Caili had just arrived when they heard a booming sound from a stone house ahead, followed by plumes of black smoke pouring out of the doors and windows, particularly conspicuous against the pure white backdrop of the Pure Land.

"No!! The heat is wrong! Get out of here, you troublesome thing!"

A young man emerged from the stone house with the black smoke. Seeing Hua Caili, he smiled slightly, "Little Caili is here."

As he spoke, he elegantly dusted the soot from his sleeves.

"Uncle Yuanying," Hua Caili greeted politely, then quickly introduced, "This is Brother Yun, the former God Child of the Dream Weaver Divine Realm, previously named..."

"Oh! Meng Jianyuan, I've heard of him." Divine Attendant Yuanying¹ smiled warmly, looking like a harmless, benevolent person. "Just as perfect a divine character as little Caili, and in terms of talent... Oh, even in appearance, you two are quite a match. It's a pity that boy Jiuzhi got there first."

Yun Che: (He's a good judge of character... and speaks his mind...)

"Yun Che greets Senior Yuanying. Although I've just arrived in the Pure Land, I've long admired Senior Yuanying's name."

"Enough with the formalities," Yuanying waved his hand, only then noticing that his fair hands were now as black as the bottom of a pot, so he slowly put them behind his back. "His Highness is in high spirits right now, it's best not to disturb him, or else..."

Another muffled explosion sounded, accompanied by even thicker black smoke.

Then, an excited shout came from the stone house, "Oh ho! It's done, it's done! Little Caili, come in quickly, I have something good!"

Yuanying sighed deeply, a helpless look on his face.

"Brother Yun, Uncle Liu Xiao is calling us, let's go in."

Hua Caili leaped into the stone house, and Yun Che, after nodding politely to Divine Attendant Yuanying, followed her.

Divine Attendant Yuanying didn't stop him, only sighing softly, "Another young person's perception is about to be shattered~~"

The stone house wasn't large, but it was filled with a dazzling array of items.

Amidst the billowing black smoke, an old man in a coarse gray robe, thin and small, was crouched there, his two thin hands rubbing together over a strange aura of red fire, his eyes shining brightly, muttering to himself.

From Yun Che's perspective, he looked like a toad scratching with its front paws.

"Uncle Liu Xiao," Hua Caili called out affectionately.

The toad... Oh no, the gray-robed old man suddenly sprang up and scurried over to Hua Caili with quick little steps. "Little Caili, you've come just in time. Quick, have a taste! This is my newly improved recipe. For this, I had to keep pestering that old woman Lingxian for her fire, and it's finally done!"

"This is definitely my greatest work in the past thousand years! I guarantee it will send you to heaven with just one bite!"

His face was withered and old, his eye sockets deeply sunken, but now they shone with a bright light, and even his sparse, messy hair stood on end with excitement.

In his dirty old hands, he held a similarly dirty-looking dumpling, which emitted a soul-soothing fragrance.

"..." Yun Che stood still, the corner of his mouth twitching slightly.

He had heard Hua Caili call him "Uncle Liu Xiao."

This old man, whose clothes could only be described as tattered and whose demeanor was utterly mad... was actually... a Divine Official!?

And, Divine Official Lingxian was "Grandma," so why was this withered old man "Uncle"?

"Wow, really!"

Hua Caili's eyes curved into crescents. She took the dumpling from the old man and, without any hesitation, put it directly into her mouth.

With one bite, Hua Caili's eyes lit up. "Mmm! Delicious! It's the same 'Liu Xiao Ascension Cake,' but it's much tastier than before... Mmm! Even the flavor variations are more numerous. Ha!"

"Right! Right! Ho ho ho ho ho ho!"

Hua Caili's approval and praise made the old man's hair stand on end, and his wild laughter seemed as if his soul was about to leave his body. "As expected of me! As expected of the Pure... Oh no no no, the Abyss's number one chef!"

"Oh right! From now on, it's renamed Liu Xiao Flying Immortal Cake. No matter who eats it, real immortal or fake, they'll all fly, ho ho ho ho!"

Hua Caili continued to chew carefully, savoring the taste, and then, amidst the old man's unrestrained laughter, she spoke slowly, "Although it's tastier than before, compared to the pastries Brother Yun makes, it's still a little bit lacking."

The old man's wild laughter stopped abruptly as if cut off by a knife.

His already small eyes widened to the size of copper bells.

"You you you you you... What did you say? My? My Liu Xiao Flying Immortal Cake? A little bit lacking?"

He stared wide-eyed, confirming each word, as if these words had touched a great taboo that he absolutely could not tolerate.

"That's right." Hua Caili nodded without the slightest hesitation. Her beautiful eyes were as clear as a mirror lake, pure with a hint of innocence. Whether in words or expression, she was so natural and... matter-of-fact.

In that instant, Yun Che seemed to hear something shattering in the old man's chest.

Then, he jumped up and screamed, "Impossible! This Liu Xiao Flying Immortal Cake is the culmination of a thousand years of my hard work, tens of thousands of adjustments, to create this unparalleled delicacy. Even I want to kiss myself after eating it!"

"What is this Yun Gege thing? How dare this unlucky name be worthy of making such a delicacy as mine?"

"It's not 'as yours,'" Hua Caili quickly corrected. "It really is tastier than what Uncle Liu Xiao makes, and not just pastries. Many things Brother Yun makes are much tastier than what Uncle Liu Xiao makes."

"..."

Yun Che again heard the sound of something shattering... into pieces.
