The Eastern Sovereign Divine Attendant acknowledged the command and raised his hand. Two beams of profound light, condensed like rainbows, shot down and fell directly upon Yun Che and Hua Caili.

Hua Qingying subconsciously raised a hand to block them but was instantly pushed down by Hua Fuchen. The two could only watch helplessly as Hua Caili was bound by the chain-like profound light and brought before the High Divine Officer along with Yun Che. Under the authority of the Abyss Monarch and the High Divine Officer, they were powerless to stop it.

Moreover, forceful resistance would only enrage the High Divine Officer and lead to even more terrifying consequences. The profound light binding their bodies not only sealed their movements but also completely suppressed their profound energy, leaving them unable to muster the slightest struggle, much less escape.

The words "Punishment of Desolate Gnawing" nearly made the half-paralyzed Dian Jiuzhi leap to his feet. He stared at Hua Caili, who had been bound and brought before the High Divine Officer, his face a mask of extreme terror, as if he were the one about to be punished.

"The Punishment of Desolate Gnawing... it's the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing... Good... good... This is retribution... Haha... Hahahaha!" Dian Sansi let out a gleeful laugh, but it died in his throat the moment he met Dian Jiuzhi's gaze. His eyes were filled with a soul-corroding agony... and beyond the pain, only a terrifying emptiness.

Dian Jiuzhi's words of warning and pleading suddenly surfaced in his mind... He could no longer laugh, standing frozen in place as if his soul had completely left him.

An aura of dread and panic spread rapidly. Although the punishment was not for them, the four words "Punishment of Desolate Gnawing" awakened the deep-seated brand of fear in everyone's heart. Even some seasoned, elderly profound practitioners felt their bodies tremble uncontrollably for several breaths.

Yun Che and Hua Caili's bodies were pressed together, bound by the same profound light. They looked at each other, their gazes meeting. A thousand words condensed in their eyes, yet for a moment, none could be spoken.

The High Divine Officer stared at them, his voice thundering through the clouds, "Zhetian Hua Caili, Zhimeng Yun Che. The marriage bestowed by the Abyss Monarch himself was a supreme grace, yet you two engaged in a clandestine affair, treating the imperial decree as nothing. This act has brought shame upon the Senluo¹ and is a contemptuous disregard for the Abyss Monarch and the Pure Land. Your crime is unforgivable and shall be met with the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing!"

"Eastern Sovereign, carry out the sentence!"

"Wait! High Divine Officer, please hear me out."

Meng Kongchan threw all caution to the wind. Despite his status as a Divine Sovereign, he stumbled as he rushed forward. "The matter between Jian Yuan and Caili was by no means an intentional violation of the marriage bestowed by the Abyss Monarch. There are many hidden difficulties and helpless circumstances behind it. When Jian Yuan and Caili first met, he didn't even know she was the Zhetian Divine Maiden. Their subsequent..."

"Wumeng Divine Sovereign," the High Divine Officer's voice was not loud, but its heavy authority cut Meng Kongchan's words short. "Considering your status as a Divine Sovereign, I will permit you to answer three questions."

Meng Kongchan could not resist and could only comply. "Very well."

The High Divine Officer asked the first question: "Is it true that there was a private affair between them?"

Meng Kongchan's lips moved as he struggled to organize his thoughts. "Their feelings for each other began in the Sea of Fog..."

"Answer the question!" the High Divine Officer's voice turned sharp.

"..." Meng Kongchan sighed inwardly, his voice weakening. "Yes."

The High Divine Officer asked the second question: "Have they consummated their relationship as man and woman?"

Meng Kongchan slowly closed his eyes, his voice growing fainter still. "Yes."

A clamor arose from the surroundings, and many gazes shifted secretly toward the stunned Dian Jiuzhi... some mocking, some pitying, some lamenting his misfortune.

The High Divine Officer asked the third question: "When did you and the Huaxin Divine Sovereign learn of their affair?"

Before the High Divine Officer, any attempt at concealment would only make matters worse. He could only answer truthfully, "Three years ago."

"Hmph!" Dian Luohou sneered, his expression beyond "ugly."

The High Divine Officer said gravely, "In that case, as the Divine Sovereign of a nation, you should know how absurd the words 'hidden difficulties' are!"

Meng Kongchan knew the High Divine Officer was right. No matter how great the hidden difficulties were, they could not change what had already happened, nor could they excuse the established "wrong" and "crime."

Meng Kongchan turned to face the Abyss Monarch, his expression pleading. "Abyss Monarch, Kongchan knows that Jian Yuan has committed a monstrous crime, but... as his father, I lost him for a full hundred years due to a moment of negligence. Every time I thought of it during those hundred years, I was consumed by bone-deep regret and unbearable pain."

"Now, by the heavens' mercy, he has been returned to my side... In just three short years, I have not been able to remedy even a fraction of my immense guilt and debt to him. How can I bear the pain of losing him again?"

"Even if Jian Yuan is exceptionally talented, he is ultimately only a Divine Master. He cannot possibly withstand the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing! To inflict it upon him is no different from a death sentence!"

Thud!

He fell heavily to his knees, his face etched with a pitiable plea that should never appear on a Divine Sovereign. "A son's misdeeds are the father's fault. I beg the Abyss Monarch for mercy! Allow Kongchan to take my son's place and endure a double portion of the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing! I beg for your mercy, Abyss Monarch! Kongchan will repay Your Majesty's grace in this life and the next, even if it means serving you as a loyal steed²!"

Bang!

He kowtowed heavily, his head cracking the ground of the Eden Cloud Summit and sending pale fissures spreading outward, which were then filled with streams of fresh blood. In that instant, he cast aside all the pride and dignity of a Divine Sovereign. His body curled into the most humble posture, his proud head, smeared with a Divine Sovereign's blood, ground against the earth, and he did not raise it for a long time.

"..." Yun Che drew a slow breath and closed his eyes. His slightly clenched knuckles had turned an unnatural, deathly white.

"Father... God..." Meng Jianxi let out a low, trembling cry, his eyes already misted with tears. He had never seen, never even imagined, that his father, who stood as tall as a celestial mountain, would one day assume such a humble posture.

He stepped forward and fell to his knees with a thud behind his father, slamming his head to the ground and crying out in anguish, "I beg the Abyss Monarch for mercy!"

Thud! Thud! Thud...

The sound of kneeling continued unabated. Before the dazed eyes of the crowd, everyone from the Zhimeng Divine Kingdom knelt on both knees and kowtowed heavily.

"We beg the Abyss Monarch for mercy!" The anguished cries were deafening and struck the soul. The varied expressions on the faces of the crowd grew complicated at this moment.

"..." The fury in Dian Luohou's eyes froze for a moment, but then he whipped his head away with a heavy snort, refusing to look again.

"Alas," Hua Fuchen sighed softly. He did not plead for Hua Caili as Meng Kongchan had, even though the Abyss Monarch doted on her, and even though Hua Qingying held more weight in the High Divine Officer's eyes than the seven Divine Sovereigns.

He knew that the Abyss Monarch's decree could not be defied, much less broken in public. It was impossible that Meng Kongchan did not know this. And as the Wumeng Divine Sovereign, the one with the strongest soul among the seven Divine Sovereigns of the six kingdoms, his spirit was undoubtedly the most resilient and clear-headed... yet at this moment, it had crumbled so completely.

As expected, the Abyss Monarch said nothing. He did not even spare them a single glance.

The High Divine Officer's cold eyes narrowed as he spoke gravely, "Meng Kongchan, all of you will withdraw within three breaths. Otherwise, your crimes will be compounded!"

Meng Kongchan remained prostrate, his body wracked with painful tremors.

Hua Fuchen stepped forward and forcibly pulled him up, sighing, "Since the Abyss Monarch has given the order, it cannot be changed. Things have come to this; there is no other way. We can only... leave it to the children. They cannot afford any more complications now."

Those last words jolted Meng Kongchan back to his senses. He had no choice but to rise and say weakly, "Everyone... withdraw."

"Senior."

Yun Che's voice sounded by Meng Kongchan's ear. Meng Kongchan, Meng Jianxi... everyone from Zhimeng turned their heads, their gazes trembling as they looked at Yun Che. His voice was calm, no different from usual, without a hint of tremor or fear.

"Regardless of any 'hidden difficulties,' we ultimately violated the marriage bestowed by the Abyss Monarch himself. It is an irrefutable crime. Since it is a crime, we must accept the punishment. Caili and I have no regrets or complaints."

He turned his head slightly, a gentle smile on his face as usual. "Senior, a few days ago, I thought of a rather fancy way to make soup, one that can give it a dreamy, picturesque appearance. I just haven't had the chance to make it yet."

"When we return, I will make it for you. I believe you will certainly like it."

"..." Meng Kongchan's lips trembled, and then he began to laugh, though his eyes were filled with tears. "Good... A man of my Zhimeng must not break his promise."

Yun Che nodded heavily, then reached out and grasped Hua Caili's cold, fair wrist. Hua Caili squeezed his hand back and moved even closer to him, no longer caring where they were or who was around them.

"Caili, are you afraid?" Yun Che asked softly.

Hua Caili nodded, then shook her head. "I was so scared just now, but when you're by my side, I'm not scared at all... When I think that after today, we can be together openly, without needing to worry or be afraid anymore, I'm even less scared."

In her pure and beautiful world, the gazes, words, and judgments of others meant nothing when it came to her feelings for Yun Che. They clung to each other as if no one else existed, whispering softly... and the crowd truly could not detect the slightest trace of fear from them.

In the distance, Dian Jiuzhi's empty eyes flickered slightly. Then, a faint smile slowly bloomed on his face as he murmured in a daze, "This is her... This is what she's like when she loves someone..."

"This is how... she was always meant to be..."

"Eastern Sovereign, carry out the sentence!"

The High Divine Officer gave the order again... only to be interrupted by another voice. This time, it was the Abyss Monarch.

"Huang³, you will carry out the sentence personally."

The Eastern Sovereign Divine Attendant, whose hand was just raised, immediately retracted it and stepped back without hesitation. The High Divine Officer was puzzled but would not ask a single question. He strode forward, and the moment he raised his arm, the divine pressure crushing down on Yun Che and Hua Caili was countless times more terrifying than the Eastern Sovereign's.

A gentle breeze suddenly rose, carrying with it the clear, elegant voice of a woman. "High Divine Officer, please stay your hand for a moment."

This woman's voice actually made the strict, almost heartless High Divine Officer pause his actions. The woman was dressed in a plain white robe adorned with autumn plums. Her eyes were like autumn pools, her skin fair. She had an air of refined elegance that transcended the mortal world, making her age difficult to guess. It was Su Shang, the personal divine attendant of the Lingxian Divine Officer.

"Aunt Su Shang..." Hua Caili subconsciously murmured.

"What is it?" the High Divine Officer asked gravely.

Divine Attendant Su Shang curtsied gracefully to the Abyss Monarch and the High Divine Officer before smiling faintly. "Su Shang has come on my master's orders to request a boon from the Abyss Monarch for Yun Che, to have his punishment waived or lightened."

At these words, the High Divine Officer's brow furrowed deeply, and everyone else exchanged bewildered glances, their eyes filled with astonishment. The esteemed Lingxian Divine Officer... was pleading for Yun Che?!

The most surprised of all was Meng Kongchan, and after the surprise came an overwhelming joy, as if a gift had fallen from the heavens.

He bowed deeply, his voice trembling with excitement. "On behalf of my unworthy son Jian Yuan, I, Meng, thank the Lingxian Divine Officer for her great kindness."

"There is no need for thanks," Su Shang replied with calm elegance. "Yun Che did our master a favor, so it is only right that our master repays him."

Meng Kongchan suppressed the excitement in his heart. He now realized it must have been the Primordial Flame Crystal! He never expected that Yun Che would act on his reminder so quickly after arriving in the Pure Land, and that it would yield such a surprising result at this crucial moment.

The High Divine Officer asked, "What kind of favor?"

The four Divine Officers understood each other well, and the Lingxian Divine Officer was the one among them least willing to ask the Abyss Monarch for anything. For her to do so meant this was no ordinary favor.

Su Shang was silent for a moment, then smiled faintly. "Since the High Divine Officer asks, Su Shang will naturally tell all she knows."

Her answer was four short, direct words: "Primordial Flame Crystal."

The doubt in the High Divine Officer's eyes immediately turned to understanding. In a corner of the Eden Cloud Summit, the Dragon Lord's aged body trembled slightly, a look of shock that others could not comprehend flashing in his eyes. Behind him, Long Chixin and Long Qianxin's expressions also changed drastically.

"The Primordial Flame Crystal... it has actually appeared in the world again," the Dragon Lord murmured, his heart in turmoil.

Long Chixin took half a step forward and lowered his voice to a whisper. "The events of today will surely spread. If word reaches Long Xi's ears... the consequences will be unpredictable."

Long Qianxin's brow was deeply furrowed. He then said, "Dragon Lord, there is no need to worry. This Primordial Flame Crystal is being used by the Lingxian Divine Officer. Long Xi cannot possibly come to the Pure Land to seize it by force. When this news spreads, it will serve as proof that the Primordial Flame Crystal is not extinct, which might prevent her from falling into despair too quickly and leaving the Dragon Clan... In that sense, it might be a good thing."

The Dragon Lord took a deep breath. "What I worry about is that since the Primordial Flame Crystal is not extinct, she might actually find one... If that happens, she will have found all the so-called Five Spirit Anomalies. At that point... her leaving would be a small matter. But after discovering she was deceived, given her temperament... she will surely become a great disaster for our clan."

"Rest assured, Dragon Lord," Long Chixin said with a grim and determined expression. "I will keep a close watch on her in secret... I guarantee that even if another Primordial Flame Crystal truly appears in this world, she will never be able to obtain it."

Just then, another gentle breeze swept by, carrying a lazy, languid voice. "Well now, what a coincidence."

A young man, treading on thin clouds, sauntered over. His posture was lazy, his voice soft, completely out of place with the solemn atmosphere of the Eden Cloud Summit. Yet he seemed utterly oblivious, a wide grin on his face. Even with the Abyss Monarch and the High Divine Officer present, he did not restrain his extremely discourteous, carefree demeanor.

In the entire Pure Land, besides the four Divine Officers, there was only one person who dared to act this way before the Abyss Monarch: the personal divine attendant of the Liuxiao Divine Officer, Yuan Ying.

"What are you doing here?" The High Divine Officer clearly disliked this person. "Could it be..."

"The High Divine Officer's guess is correct," Divine Attendant Yuan Ying said, giving the Abyss Monarch a distant bow. "Yuan Ying has come on my master's orders to ask the Abyss Monarch for a big favor on Yun Che's behalf. I ask that the Abyss Monarch consider his youth and ignorance, his youthful vigor, his youthful recklessness, his youthful... uh, and that this is his first offense, and grant him a lenient sentence."

This time, everyone present was utterly stunned. What virtue or ability did this Yun Che possess to make two of the Pure Land's Divine Officers personally plead for him to the Abyss Monarch in such a short time? Since ancient times, it was likely that not even the Divine Sovereigns of the various kingdoms had ever received such an honor.

The excitement in Meng Kongchan's heart was beyond words. He bowed deeply once more. "I, Meng, thank the Liuxiao Divine Officer for his great kindness."

"No thanks needed, no thanks needed," Divine Attendant Yuan Ying waved his hands hastily. "To be able to repay this kid's favor, my master couldn't be happier."

These words left everyone dumbfounded. Who didn't know that the Liuxiao Divine Officer was the most unconventional and unyielding person in the Pure Land... no, in the entire Abyssal World? It was one thing for the Lingxian Divine Officer to owe Yun Che a favor for a Primordial Flame Crystal, but what method had he used to make the Liuxiao Divine Officer owe him one?

Even the High Divine Officer was curious enough to ask, "And what favor does Liuxiao owe?"

"Well..." Yuan Ying looked troubled and bowed apologetically. "My master said that this matter concerns a treasure of heaven and earth, and he is not to speak of it, even if the Heavenly King himself asks."

"Hmph!" The High Divine Officer looked away, no longer bothering to ask.

The six great divine kingdoms could never defy the Abyss Monarch's decree. But outside the divine kingdoms, exceptions like the four Divine Officers existed. With two Divine Officers pleading in unison, it was impossible for the Abyss Monarch to ignore them.

He finally responded, his gaze falling upon Yun Che. All eyes also focused on him. The terror had faded from Meng Kongchan's expression, and the gloom in Hua Fuchen's eyes had mostly dissipated. Even the chilling darkness in Hua Qingying's azure eyes had receded.

The Abyss Monarch spoke faintly, "Yun Che, since Lingxian and Liuxiao plead for you, I naturally cannot disregard it. Do you have anything to say?"

Yun Che showed his gratitude and said solemnly, "Yun Che will engrave the great kindness of the two senior Divine Officers in his heart. I boldly wish to borrow the grace of the two senior Divine Officers to ask the Abyss Monarch for a boon."

"Speak," the Abyss Monarch's eyes were like a bottomless abyss; no one could discern any true emotion from his pupils.

At this point, Meng Kongchan heaved a heavy sigh of relief. A plea from one Divine Officer might only lighten Yun Che's Punishment of Desolate Gnawing. But a plea from two was definitely enough to have him exempted from it.

However, given Yun Che's character, he would never abandon Hua Caili to save himself. Therefore, he would surely use the favors from the two Divine Officers to request a reduction... or even a pardon for both of them. Things having come to this, there could be no better outcome.

Everyone believed that Yun Che could now lead Hua Caili away with a greatly reduced sentence... or even escape the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing, which was tantamount to death, completely unscathed.

Yun Che gently squeezed Hua Caili's palm with the hand holding hers, then slowly let go.

He looked up, meeting the Abyss Monarch's gaze directly, and spoke, each word slow and resonant, "I ask for the Abyss Monarch's grace to transfer Caili's crime onto myself alone."

"I am willing to bear a double portion of the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing!"
