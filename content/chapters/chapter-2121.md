Gray, blue, green, crimson—these four colors slowly drifted and intertwined within the faint white mist condensed in the ice bowl. They truly resembled naturally floating colorful clouds, carrying a subtle charm and illusion amidst their ethereal grace.

The old eyes of the Six Laughter God Official¹ were wide open, clearly showing a state of astonishment that should never appear on a World-Overseeing God Official.

Color, aroma, and taste are the complete manifestation of the culinary way, with color being paramount. Yet, the Six Laughter God Official's lifelong culinary knowledge couldn't fathom how mere four bitter leaves, so common and ordinary in the Abyss, could present such a visual spectacle under one person's hands.

"Uh..." Yun Che looked puzzled by the Six Laughter God Official's current state, then repeated, "This Four-Colored Cloud Soup, please Senior Six Laughter, taste and evaluate."

The Six Laughter God Official's eyeballs finally moved. With a "whoosh," he reached out and snatched the ice bowl from Yun Che's hand.

As the ice bowl came into his hands, his movements and aura visibly softened. After staring deeply at the colorful clouds in the bowl again, he raised his hand and slowly took a sip.

In an instant, coldness and bitterness bloomed on his tongue, then dissipated into countless bitter, cold currents, filling his taste buds. These currents then radiated to his soul sea, seemingly clarifying his spirit and even his five senses by several points.

Yet, each of these bitter, cold currents seemed distinct, sometimes strong, sometimes weak, sometimes sparse, sometimes intense, sometimes hidden, sometimes visible. Like endless, varied ethereal clouds, they caused his soul to continuously throb, uncontrollably chasing every subtle difference and change.

Until these soul-awakening bitter flavors transformed into a faint sweetness, imperceptibly and tracelessly, like a clear sky appearing after the clouds disperse, leaving his soul sea numb with intoxication.

The Six Laughter God Official didn't even know when he had closed his eyes.

When he opened them, he was staring intently at Yun Che... Although Yun Che also had two hands, two feet, one mouth, and one nose, in the God Official's eyes at this moment, he seemed like an otherworldly anomaly that shouldn't exist.

He had never known that bitterness could be so delicious... delicious enough to intoxicate the soul.

Hua Cai Li's eyes were like rosy clouds. She deeply understood the Six Laughter God Official's obsession with the culinary way, but his current reaction still greatly exceeded her expectations. She leaned forward, smiling, "Uncle Six Laughter, your expression is so strange. Is it that Brother Yun's Four-Colored Cloud Soup tastes too strange?"

As if he hadn't heard Hua Cai Li's voice, the Six Laughter God Official continued to stare straight at Yun Che, his voice even a little distorted, "This soup... is it really made only from four bitter leaves?"

He was only two steps away from Yun Che and had watched him condense this soup from four bitter leaves the entire time. In the whole world, who could deceive him, the Six Laughter God Official, especially a mere youngster in the Divine Master Realm?

But he still blurted out that question. Because his culinary understanding was completely filled with "unbelievable."

Yun Che replied with a serious expression, "Besides bitter leaves, the perfectly balanced coldness is also very important. The ice bowl is not merely a container; it is also a core auxiliary ingredient of the Four-Colored Cloud Soup. Cold bitterness awakens the soul, but if the cold dissipates and the cold bitterness turns into warm bitterness, it would instead make one very uncomfortable."

After speaking, Yun Che seemed to suddenly realize something and quickly said humbly, "Senior Six Laughter has dedicated himself to the culinary way for a million years; the realm you have reached is certainly beyond what this junior can touch. This soup and these words are merely displaying my slight skill before an expert². If I am fortunate, I hope Senior Six Laughter will not hesitate to offer corrections and guidance."

If these words had come from anyone else, the Six Laughter God Official would have merely snorted.

But facing Yun Che's "sincere" eyes at this moment, his old face felt faintly warm.

"Who taught you this Four-Colored Cloud Soup?"

Yun Che still wore an expression of flawless sincerity and frankness: "Replying to Senior, this junior's culinary foundation was built by my master, and my culinary attainments are half taught by my master, half self-developed. As for this Four-Colored Cloud Soup, it was created by this junior myself."

As if not noticing the change in the Six Laughter God Official's gaze, he continued, "Before this junior returned to the Dream Weaving Divine Kingdom, I drifted alone in the turbid world for many years; the hardships and bitterness are beyond words."

"But even in bitterness, one should seek joy. The world has a thousand kinds of sorrow, hardship, and pain, ten thousand kinds of helplessness and falsehood, but only delicious food never betrays."

As Yun Che expected, as soon as these words were spoken, the Six Laughter God Official's pupils suddenly widened by several points, followed by an uncontrollable surge of fervor.

That was the frantic throbbing of a soul that had been lonely for a million years, finally finding a kindred spirit.

"So, during these years of drifting, this junior has also been immersed in the culinary way, pleasing my own heart amidst pain, and occasionally comforting others."

The hidden light in the Six Laughter God Official's old eyes had subtly changed. He took another sip of the Four-Colored Cloud Soup and slowly said, "Bitter leaves are found everywhere in the Abyssal Dust Land, the easiest things to obtain in the world, and their bitterness penetrates the bone. But as the saying goes, 'bitterness ends, sweetness begins.' That faint sweetness after countless threads of bitterness can be so deeply etched in the heart and soul, just like traversing endless vicissitudes and finally achieving one's wish. All the past bitterness can then be smiled away with a single sip."

"Wow!" Hua Cai Li let out a slightly exaggerated gasp, "Those words are exactly the same as what Brother Yun said when he first told me about the origin of the Four-Colored Cloud Soup! As expected of Uncle Six Laughter!"

The Six Laughter God Official shot her a sidelong glance, "You little girl, you're not praising me; you're clearly using me as a stepping stone to praise your Brother Yun!"

Hua Cai Li's beautiful eyes were full of innocence, "How could that be? Brother Yun has made fifty-six kinds of soups and broths for me, and the Four-Colored Cloud Soup is the simplest and relatively most ordinary among them. If I were really going to praise him, I would definitely choose 'Cloud-Dyed Plum Fragrance Broth,' 'Star River Dewfall,' 'Huo Xin Dream Cloud Cup,' 'Vast Sea Pearl Tears'... and the 'Yun Yue Glazed Heart-Joining Porridge' that Brother Yun made especially for me, which is the most delicious, most beautiful, and has the most beautiful name."

The Six Laughter God Official's recently regained composure was once again shattered by Hua Cai Li's words. He widened his eyes again, his speech becoming stammering, "Fi... fi... fifty-six kinds? And all... all of them are better than this Four-Colored Cloud Soup?"

He completely ignored how inappropriate the name "Yun Yue Glazed Heart-Joining Porridge" was.

"Of course!" Hua Cai Li answered before Yun Che could, "The Four-Colored Cloud Soup is, after all, only made from four bitter leaves. No matter what, among all the soups and broths Brother Yun has made, it can only rank last."

Every word she spoke was flawless, even mixed with an innocent sense of matter-of-factness. As her beautiful, glazed eyes blinked, she seemed to be wondering why the Six Laughter God Official had such a strange question.

The Six Laughter God Official opened his mouth, and a gurgling sound from his throat was faintly audible between his teeth. He stared intently at Yun Che, and it took several breaths before he spoke, "Youngster, it's still the same thing: I don't have much else here, but all kinds of ingredients in the world... those you've seen and those you haven't, I have them all! I permit you to use any ingredients here to make your most proud dish, the one that best showcases your culinary attainments!"

"If you can impress me, let alone admitting defeat to little Cai Li..."

His words revealed an excitement and urgency that Hua Cai Li had never seen before. In his eagerness to witness Yun Che's culinary skill, he hadn't even thought about what kind of stakes to offer, and for a moment, he stammered.

Yun Che quickly interjected, "Senior Six Laughter, you overstate! How could this junior dare to accept the word 'impress' before you?"

He looked around, sincerely saying, "Although Senior Six Laughter's divine residence here appears humble, the preciousness of the ingredients stored within it would likely be unmatched even by the combined treasures of the six divine kingdoms. Senior Six Laughter allowing this junior to freely use them is already a great favor. This junior will certainly do my utmost and dare not disappoint you."

After a string of respectful words, Yun Che's gaze shifted, and his eyes instantly became clear and dust-free.

The words the Six Laughter God Official was about to speak stopped in his throat. His old eyes once again re-examined Yun Che.

A tender age of barely two jia zi cycles³, with only a Divine Master Realm cultivation, yet he could, beside a God Official, and in the God Official's residence, instantly focus his mind and dismiss all distracting thoughts.

In his lifetime, he had seen countless generations of God Children and God Daughters, each standing at the pinnacle of their peers, yet none had ever been able to do this.

...

After a brief silence, Yun Che's gaze suddenly became resolute. He reached out his hand, and dozens of wind vortices simultaneously swirled from his fingertips. As they revolved, they brought sixty-six different kinds of ingredients before Yun Che.

Hua Cai Li felt dazzled, and she didn't even know the names of more than eighty percent of them.

Flames ignited, directly engulfing all the ingredients. Then, Yun Che's hands danced, and wherever his fingers passed, streaks of wind blades swept through. Yet, each of these dozens of wind blades seemed distinct, some gentle, some nimble, some vigorous, some fierce, simultaneously breaking, cutting, purifying, and blending different ingredients in different ways...

Even more miraculous than that was the flame.

It was clearly a single flame, yet it seemed to contain dozens of distinct clusters of fire. Although the flames were connected, their temperatures and intensities were completely different, as if dozens of imperceptible and insurmountable invisible barriers separated them into dozens of independent fire domains that did not interfere with each other.

The Six Laughter God Official had already noticed this unusual flame phenomenon when Yun Che made the "Moon-Tilted Cloud-Reflecting Crisp." Now, it was presented to his five senses with several times the clarity of that time.

Wind and fire intertwined, fire intensifying the wind, wind coiling the flames. The sixty-six ingredients were completely enveloped within, and even their aromas could barely escape. Only the completely overlapping sounds of wind blades and burning flames could be heard.

Hua Cai Li's eyes shone like stars, the flames reflecting her overflowing affection, adoration, and anticipation.

At this moment, anyone with a little experience nearby could discern the unusually deep emotions she held for Yun Che in her eyes. But the Six Laughter God Official was completely oblivious; his eyes were fixed on Yun Che, his aura completely restrained. He didn't even breathe heavily, let alone move his eyeballs a fraction.

However, even as a God Official, he couldn't detect the ultimate purifying power from the Heavenly Poison Pearl⁴, hidden within the flames and wind blades.

Bang!

With a soft sound, the fire extinguished, and the wind dispersed, leaving only wisps of white mist.

The white mist slowly settled, revealing an ice bowl that had formed at some unknown point.

As the Six Laughter God Official's gaze fell upon it, the bowl seemed to hold a poetic image of a morning glow, reflecting a light yet exceptionally vibrant crimson.

He took a step forward. As his line of sight shifted slightly, the morning glow instantly transformed into a sky full of flowing gold, as if narrating the last brilliance before dusk.

The Six Laughter God Official paused, and when his gaze shifted again, the flowing gold was gone. The scene in the bowl transformed into early spring's icy silk, crystal clear and seemingly carrying a faint chill of spring. With another shift of his eyes, the icy silk melted, and vibrant green filled his vision—a purity and vitality only seen in a pure land.

"Beautiful, so beautiful!" Hua Cai Li let out an uncontrollable soft gasp, "From different angles, you can actually see completely different colors."

Yun Che held the ice bowl and smiled, "My master said that while taste is paramount in food, color should also captivate. So, this time, I showed off a little, using the original colors of different ingredients as a base, supplemented by ice mist, to lay out six layers of color for this soup. From far to near, one can gradually see six different scenes, distinctly: morning glow, approaching dusk, early spring, late summer, deep night, and thin clouds."

Hua Cai Li pursed her lips, unable to hide her pride and adoration: "In this world, only Brother Yun can make food look so beautiful."

Yun Che returned her smile, but before he could speak, the ice bowl in his hand lightened, already having landed in the Six Laughter God Official's hands.

"What is this soup called?!" he asked directly, his eyes glued to the ice bowl. In just a few words, his nose twitched five or six times.

Yun Che gently replied, "This soup is named... Six Laughter Scorns the Mortal Dust."

The Six Laughter God Official looked up, his eyes, stained with millions of years of mortal dust, met those of this junior who was only "two jia zi cycles" old: "Sixty-six ingredients, six layers of color, Six Laughter Scorns the Mortal Dust... Does that mean this soup isn't your masterpiece, but rather an impromptu creation for this specific time and place?"

"Yes," Yun Che nodded frankly, "This junior heard Cai Li mention long ago that Senior Six Laughter often recites, 'Laugh at others, laugh at oneself, laugh at ancient and modern times; laugh at heaven, laugh at earth, laugh at all living beings⁵.' Although this junior's experience is shallow, I can still feel a transcendent and unrestrained perspective from these fourteen short characters, a sense of looking down upon what the world yearns for.

"Today, I finally had the honor of meeting Senior Six Laughter. As a World-Overseeing God Official, Senior possesses no intimidating aura or arrogant demeanor. If you were in the mortal world, perhaps no one would recognize your divine official status. All beings and things in the world, their ranks and rituals, seem to be but a play of mortal dust in Senior's eyes. Such a state of mind and soul is beyond this junior's reach, and my admiration is far greater than my previous yearning.

"This 'Six Laughter Scorns the Mortal Dust' was created by this junior based on these feelings, to show my respect for Senior Six Laughter. Please, Senior, taste and evaluate."

At these words, even Hua Cai Li, who was well aware of Yun Che's "glib tongue⁶," couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.

The Six Laughter God Official's dirty gray beard trembled. He clicked his tongue and sighed, "Good boy, what a 'Six Laughter Scorns the Mortal Dust,' and what a wonderfully exquisite flattery⁷."

With that, he raised his hand and tilted his head. Though his movement was grand, he only took a shallow sip of the "Six Laughter Scorns the Mortal Dust," not allowing a single drop to spill from the bowl.

Then, he froze in place.
