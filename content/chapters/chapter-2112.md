Yun Che exited the cultivation space and saw Meng Kongchan standing with his hands clasped behind his back, seemingly having waited for quite some time.

“How was your progress?” Meng Kongchan turned around, asking casually.

“Satisfactory,” Yun Che replied respectfully. “God Emperor², coming here, is it because the time to visit the Pure Land is near?”

“No rush. There’s no need to enter the Pure Land too early. We’ll depart in three days,” Meng Kongchan said with a chuckle. “Before that, there’s something I need to remind you of in private.”

Yun Che’s expression turned serious. “Please speak, God Emperor.”

Meng Kongchan didn’t deliberately lower his voice, yet no one beyond ten feet could hear their conversation. “When you first returned, you displayed a Primordial Flame Crystal³. After that, I issued an order to the seven Dream Halls, strictly forbidding anyone from revealing the existence of the Primordial Flame Crystal.”

Yun Che’s heart stirred slightly, and he said thoughtfully, “Could it be…?” To him, the Primordial Flame Crystal was just one of the various unusual profound crystals he had found in the Mist Sea. Before that, he hadn’t even known its name.

“Indeed,” Meng Kongchan nodded slightly. “Someone in the Pure Land needs it, and it’s a Divine Official⁴.”

Yun Che’s heart leaped.

“If I hadn’t immediately blocked the news back then, I’m afraid the Pure Land would have already sent someone to take it.”

Meng Kongchan used the word “take,” not “request.” After all, who could refuse the words of a Divine Official?

“Being indebted to a Divine Official, there’s a big difference between having it taken from afar and offering it in person. The former would have her repay the favor to the Weaving Dream God Realm, while the latter…” He smiled faintly. “You will gain her attention, perhaps even her favor. For your future, it will definitely be of great benefit.”⁵

Yun Che’s face showed gratitude, and he nodded heavily. “I understand. Thank you for your painstaking efforts, God Emperor. Which Divine Official needs the Primordial Flame Crystal?”

“Divine Official Lingxian⁶,” Meng Kongchan said slowly. “Divine Official Lingxian is the daughter of one of the three ancient gods—the Vermillion Bird God Spirit⁷. However, she is not a pure Vermillion Bird descendant. Her father is the Vermillion Bird God Spirit, and her mother is a Thundercloud Immortal Sparrow⁸. Thus, she was born with three elemental divine powers: fire, lightning, and wind, but she is also deeply troubled by them, often suffering from chaotic wind and thunder, and flames devouring her heart.”

Yun Che: “…”

“Later, she happened upon a Primordial Flame Crystal and used it to easily suppress the backlash of the Vermillion Bird flames. Her power is primarily fire-based. With the fire affliction temporarily extinguished, she naturally wouldn’t fear the chaos of wind and thunder. However, the suppression of the Primordial Flame Crystal is not permanent. Once its effect disappears, the adverse effects naturally return.”

“Therefore, for these years, Divine Official Lingxian has been searching everywhere for the Primordial Flame Crystal. Its color and aura are recorded in great detail in various announcements and records. Because of this, although almost no one has seen a Primordial Flame Crystal, most can recognize it at a glance.”

Meng Kongchan sighed. “The Primordial Flame Crystal from back then was like a fleeting epiphyllum⁹. Since then, there has been no news of a second Primordial Flame Crystal appearing. And this heaven-sent opportunity… Yuan’er, you must seize it firmly.”

The words “Vermillion Bird” were far more sensitive to Yun Che than Meng Kongchan imagined.

Of the three ancient supreme fire deities, Yun Che had come into contact with the souls of the Phoenix and the Golden Crow, and had received many favors from them, but he had never been able to touch the legacy of the Vermillion Bird… except for the Flame God Realm’s Vermillion Bird Sect, which carried a thin bloodline and incomplete divine arts.

According to the ancient records of the God Realm, the Vermillion Bird was the first of the three supreme fire deities to become extinct.

But Divine Official Lingxian, one of the four Divine Officials of the Pure Land, was actually the daughter of the Vermillion Bird… In other words, the Vermillion Bird lineage had never actually become extinct, but had always existed in the abyss!

Yun Che, inheriting both the Phoenix Flame and the Golden Crow Flame, understood very well why someone as strong as Divine Official Lingxian would experience elemental chaos within her body.

Back then, when the Golden Crow soul bestowed upon him the Golden Crow inheritance, it forcefully wanted to completely strip away and eliminate all traces of the Phoenix bloodline within him.

Because this involved the dignity of the ancient flame gods. As supreme beings of flame, how could they tolerate the coexistence of other divine flames… let alone other elemental powers?

Only his Ancestral Saint body could make all the powers in the world obedient within him.

In this respect, the moment Divine Official Lingxian was born, she was destined to suffer many hardships in her life.

“As for how to meet Divine Official Lingxian…” Meng Kongchan’s smile was ambiguous. “With that Cai’li girl, it’s much easier for you to meet Divine Official Lingxian than anyone else.”

It was no secret in the six God Realms that Divine Official Lingxian’s favorite was Hua Caili. The sea of colorful clouds in Hua Caili ’li’s courtyard was a gift from Divine Official Lingxian.

“Good!” Yun Che returned the smile. “I will definitely seize such an opportunity.”

“Haha, I’m not worried about that. You were able to make Qing… cough, your aunt look at you with anticipation, Divine Official Lingxian will definitely like you as well.”

“Rest well for the next few days, and then accompany your father to the Pure Land.” He turned around, then suddenly said with some emotion, “Yuan’er, I’m very pleased that you and Jianxi can get along so well. To be honest, in the past few years, my worries in my dreams were all about the future of the Weaving Dream Realm. Now, with you two brothers… all my thoughts and dreams are filled with gratitude and no regrets.”

“Therefore, my greatest wish now is for you two to always be safe and sound, free from the disasters of the past. Besides that, be it progress or opportunities, they are all just icing on the cake.”

He glanced sideways, inadvertently looking at the soul ring he had imprinted on Yun Che’s little finger for a moment… He naturally hoped that the day this soul ring shattered would never come.

“This junior will heed God Emperor’s teachings,” Yun Che said solemnly. “Please rest assured, God Emperor, I cherish my life far more than you think. No matter when or where, I will never put myself in danger.”

Meng Kongchan nodded and smiled as he prepared to leave.

“God Emperor, please wait a moment, this junior… has something to offer you.”

Meng Kongchan turned around in confusion and saw an extremely rare look of apprehension on Yun Che’s face. In his hand, he held a pendant strung with red, blue, and yellow crystals.

“This is?”

Yun Che quickly said, “Master once mentioned that the sound of Brahma Stones¹⁰ colliding can purify the heart and soul, and is most beneficial to those who cultivate their souls. This junior happened to have a few Brahma Stones, so I made them into this ornament to express my gratitude to God Emperor… I hope God Emperor won’t find it crude.”

Meng Kongchan’s eyes flickered slightly. He reached out to take it, smiling, “I’m naturally very happy that you have such intentions.”

After speaking, he tied the Brahma Stones directly to his waist. As they swayed, they made a clear, pleasant colliding sound.

“Mm, I like it very much, hahahaha!” He laughed loudly and turned to leave.

Meng Zhiyan hurriedly followed, respectfully escorting the Dreamless God Emperor out of the hall.

A gentle breeze blew, bringing with it another string of colliding Brahma Stone sounds. Meng Kongchan suddenly said, “These Brahma Stones are truly as heart-purifying and soul-cleansing as the rumors say. Just a few notes have actually improved my mood quite a bit.”

Meng Zhiyan secretly smiled, her voice respectful. “If Young Master were to hear God Emperor’s words, he would be overjoyed. Young Master spoke of these Brahma Stones lightly, but in reality… he put a great deal of effort into them.”

“Oh?” Meng Kongchan stopped and looked back, motioning for her to continue.

Meng Zhiyan lowered her head, a hint of nervousness in her voice. “God Emperor may not know, but Young Master has always been exceptionally grateful and respectful towards you, and at the same time, feels a deep sense of guilt. He has often mentioned that he is still unable to recall the name ‘Meng Jianyuan,’ unable to address you as ‘Father God’ without any reservation from the bottom of his heart, and thus feels deeply ashamed of everything you have done for him.”

“And as God Emperor, the supreme being, there is nothing in the world that can catch your eye. Fortunately, the food Young Master makes pleases you. Therefore, besides cultivation, the thing Young Master does most often is immerse himself in the kitchen, and he doesn’t allow any of us to interfere in the slightest.”

“Therefore, every pastry and soup Young Master makes for God Emperor contains nothing but a sincere heart.”

“…” Meng Kongchan stood still for a few breaths before walking away.

After walking for a long while, he looked up at the clouds, a faint mist seemingly covering his eyes.

“It’s enough…” he murmured. “Like this… even if he can’t truly call out ‘Father God’ in his lifetime, it’s enough…”

Meng Zhiyan returned to the hall. Upon seeing Yun Che, she slowed her steps and walked over, saying somewhat timidly, “Young Master, this servant took the liberty of speaking to God Emperor about you just now. If… if this servant has done wrong, please punish me.”

Yun Che smiled. “In our God Child Hall, unless specifically instructed otherwise, there is nothing that cannot be said. What wrong is there?”

Facing Young Master, who never got angry and never showed even a hint of arrogance or temper, Meng Zhiyan’s already limited timidity was mostly feigned.

With Yun Che’s words, her smile blossomed, and she suddenly became bold. “Can I really say anything? Then this servant wants to ask… when does Young Master plan to favor Zhiyan?”

Her beautiful eyes were sparkling, yet she refused to avert her gaze from Yun Che.

Yun Che still smiled faintly. He reached out his hand, and under Meng Zhiyan’s hopeful gaze… it landed on the top of her head, stroking it affectionately. “Little girl, your life has just begun. Don’t tie yourself to a bad person.”

Meng Zhiyan couldn’t hide her disappointment as she pouted. “If Young Master is a bad person, then there are no good people in this world.”

“That’s why you’re still a little girl.” Yun Che’s expression remained unchanged, but in the depths of his eyes was a dark sea that Meng Zhiyan could never truly understand.

Moving his fingers down from the girl’s hair, Yun Che turned and left leisurely.

Looking at his back, Meng Zhiyan let out an extremely firm murmur, “This servant is of lowly status and does not dare to hope for any title. I only wish to serve by Young Master’s side for a lifetime…”

She knew she wasn’t qualified to love him. Being able to accompany him for a long time was already her lifelong wish.

Her whisper, however, received a response from Yun Che: “A lifetime is very long, don’t say it lightly. Though Zhiyan is small, she can also soar for thousands of miles. Don’t easily bind your own life.”

Meng Zhiyan stood in place, dazed for a long time.

The Weaving Dream Divine Ark rose into the air, its aura attracting the attention of the entire Weaving Dream God Realm.

Meng Kongchan stood at the bow of the ark. The nine Dream Hall Masters were all present, and behind each of them followed the most outstanding juniors of their respective Dream Halls.

It was no exaggeration to say that the core figures of the Weaving Dream God Realm’s current and next generation were all gathered here.

But in Yun Che’s view, out of the vast God Realm, only a hundred people could enter the Pure Land… This Pure Land was truly stingy.

The giant ark soared, flying straight towards the Supreme Pure Land.

Yun Che and Meng Jianxi stood side by side.

Meng Jianxi smiled. “Yuan’di, this is the first time you’ve stepped outside the realm since you returned home. But it seems you’re not too excited.”

“When adrift, I had no home in the four seas, yet the four seas were my home. So, I’ve long since lost my anticipation for unknown lands. However, the Pure Land is clearly not included in this.”

Yun Che asked curiously, “Has Xi God Child ever met the Abyss Emperor¹¹?”

“I was fortunate enough to once.”

Mentioning the Abyss Emperor, Meng Jianxi, like everyone else, instantly showed reverence. “The Abyss Emperor in my imagination was majestic yet benevolent, possessing an aura that made all souls tremble and a supreme imperial might that shook the heavens and earth with a single word.”

“But upon meeting him in person, I realized that the Abyss Emperor was completely different from what I had imagined.”

“Completely different?” Yun Che expressed strong doubt.

Meng Jianxi seemed to have some reservations, but after thinking for a moment, he still said, “These words may be offensive, but the Abyss Emperor I saw… I couldn’t sense his aura, nor could I sense his majesty. I couldn’t even sense any changes in his emotions… even when he smiled.”

Yun Che: “…”

“The Abyss Emperor gave me the feeling of being a detached person, beyond the mundane world.” Meng Jianxi spoke his most direct understanding of the Abyss Emperor. “Perhaps, it’s truly because the Abyss Emperor’s level is too high, so high that it reaches a realm of ‘incomprehensible perception.’”

“In contrast, the Great Divine Official’s¹² imposing aura is incomparably heavy and terrifying, far surpassing Father God. Yuan’di, it’s best to be prepared when facing him.”

The two stood side by side, conversing freely, their expressions natural, occasionally smiling at each other. Seeing this, the hearts of the Dream Hall Masters were filled with complex emotions.

“Sigh.” Meng Cangji let out a long sigh. If Meng Jianxi had decided not to compete, even if he had the heart and the strength, there was nothing he could do.

“Speaking of which, with Yuan’di here, Father God will be able to hold his head high in the Pure Land this time.” Meng Jianxi’s words were sincere, not caring at all if Meng Kongchan heard them.

Meng Kongchan stood at the bow of the ark, looking into the distance, his demeanor dignified, showing no reaction.

Yun Che said humbly, “I’m only at the Divine Master Realm. In the Pure Land, I’m not qualified to catch anyone’s eye. This trip is just as a follower seeking to broaden my horizons. The true splendor of our Weaving Dream God Realm still depends on you, Xi God Child.”

Meng Jianxi shook his head with a wry smile. “You underestimate your perfect divine nature. As for me… it’s difficult.”

“Hm?” Meng Kongchan suddenly looked sideways, towards the east.

Following that, he changed his hand gesture, and the aura and trajectory of the Weaving Dream Divine Ark also changed, tilting towards the east.

Soon, another giant profound ark emitting a boundless aura appeared in sight.

“The Folding Sky Ark,” Meng Jianxi said. “It’s the Folding Sky God Realm.”

The two profound arks quickly approached each other until they were seamlessly joined together.

“Hehehe, Dreamless God Emperor, what a coincidence.”

“Hahahaha! With fate already arranged, we naturally meet without prior agreement. There’s no need for the word ‘coincidence.’”

The two God Emperors approached. Hua Fuchen had a cheerful expression, and Meng Kongchan’s smile was even more meaningful.

Yun Che’s gaze swept past Hua Fuchen and landed on the young girl beside him. His vision then blurred for a few moments.

In just three short years of not seeing her, she seemed to have undergone a complete transformation.
