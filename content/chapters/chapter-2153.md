In the Pure Land, within the square courtyard of the Evernight God Kingdom, a jet-black palanquin rested in the center. It was shrouded in a desolate chill far more profound than usual, causing the attendant Daughters of Evernight to tremble with fear, not daring to make the slightest sound.

Flanked by Shen Wuyouluan and Shen Wumingque, Shen Wuyi approached. She knelt slowly before the palanquin, her voice like shattered jade striking ice—crisp and respectful. "Wuyi pays her respects to the Mother God¹..."

Bang!

A gust of icy, sinister wind suddenly blew open the palanquin's curtains and slammed viciously into Shen Wuyi's chest. Shen Wuyi neither dodged nor defended, silently enduring the blow as her body was flung far away. A thin line of blood trickled slowly from the corner of her lips.

"Wuyi, how audacious of you!"

God Venerable Wuming's grim voice emanated from the palanquin, every word like an ice pick stabbing bone. "Before coming here, I ordered you to request the Nine-Heart Divine Lotus from the Abyssal Monarch. How dare you defy my command and go to that so-called God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain!"

Shen Wuyouluan spoke urgently, "God Venerable, please quell your anger! Wuyi did this all for you..."

"Silence!"

Another blast of sinister wind shot out, striking Shen Wuyouluan and sending her stumbling backward until she collided heavily with a courtyard pillar. "Who gave you permission to speak out of turn!"

Shen Wuyouluan struggled to her feet, lowered her head, and knelt, not daring to utter another word.

Shen Wuyi's long lashes veiled her moon-like eyes. Her voice was light and serene. "The Secret Codex² records that the 'Abyssal Heart Vine' only exists within the bodies of high-plane Abyssal Ghosts. No trace of it has ever been found in the Sea of Fog, nor has it appeared in any other records. The legendary God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain, however, is said to be roamed by countless Abyssal Ghosts, some of which were formed from ancient fallen gods. It was the greatest hope I could conceive of."

"To me, my own advancement is far less important than my Mother God's safety, which is why..."

She paused, her head bowing in shame. "But regardless of the reason, it is true that I defied your order. My crime is unforgivable, and I am willing to accept any punishment the Mother God sees fit."

Any other elder would have been moved, even touched, by such a profound display of devotion from a junior. But... the one thing God Venerable Wuming distrusted most, "detested" most, was sincerity!

Her tone was so cold it could freeze the soul. "When, in all my years of teaching you, did I ever include 'presumption'!?"

"This is the first time you have openly defied me. You will learn the consequences when we return to Evernight! Now, get out! Get out at once!"

"Yes."

Shen Wuyi answered softly and prepared to leave.

"Wait!" A sharp hiss suddenly sounded, and the surrounding atmosphere warped. Sinister currents of air churned chaotically, swiftly forming an isolation barrier at the True God level.

Within the isolated domain, God Venerable Wuming's voice seemed to echo directly in their ears and at the bottom of their souls, transforming the space into a strange and terrifying soundscape. "The order I gave you to cripple Yun Che has changed! Now, I command you to kill Yun Che!"

A chorus of sharp, ragged breaths was unnervingly clear within the isolated domain. Shen Wuyouluan, Shen Wumingque... nearly all the Daughters of Evernight revealed profound shock and confusion in their downcast eyes. Although God Venerable Wuming's words and actions had never been befitting of a God Venerable, or even a normal person, this command was truly baffling and irrational.

"Yes."

Shen Wuyi obediently lowered her eyes and complied without the slightest hesitation.

"Leave no trace!"

God Venerable Wuming's voice began to be tinged with a frightening madness. "And if Yun Che dares to set foot in the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain, that will be the perfect opportunity! It will be the heavens themselves decreeing his doom! Even the heavens cannot tolerate such a thoroughly hypocritical, filthy creature!"

The God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain was akin to a special, independent Sea of Fog, almost completely cut off from the outside world. Even the spiritual sense of a True God could not extend far within it, making it the perfect place to kill someone and dispose of the body.

"Yes," Shen Wuyi replied again.

"Get out!"

Shen Wuyi rose, helped Shen Wuyouluan to her feet, and the two walked slowly away.

The isolation barrier had not yet dissipated. Shen Wumingque hesitated for a long time before finally speaking up hesitantly. "God Venerable, after today, Yun Che of the Dreamweaver God Kingdom will surely become renowned throughout the Abyss. Even the Abyssal Monarch and the High Priest will undoubtedly see him in a new light. God Venerable Wumeng was willing to abandon her dignity for him. If we truly kill him, and our involvement is exposed, the consequences... are truly difficult to predict."

"Truly difficult to predict" was the most tactful phrasing she could muster.

"Moreover, we have no grievance with Yun Che, nor have we ever had dealings with the Dreamweaver God Kingdom... In my humble opinion, there is truly no need for us to waste our efforts on this boy." Shen Wumingque chose her words with extreme care, her tone as diplomatic as possible. If not for the fact that God Venerable Wuming's actions were so utterly incomprehensible, she would never have dared to offer a word of counsel.

"What do you know? What do you know!?"

God Venerable Wuming suddenly lost control of her emotions. Her sharp shriek made Shen Wumingque hold her breath, completely baffled as to which of her words had provoked such a reaction.

"The most beautiful woman in the world'! The words these men use to deceive women are all the same! Every single word is so foul it makes one want to vomit!"

"Willing to bear double the Desolate Gnawing Punishment alone... Heh, hahaha... Hypocrisy! Utter hypocrisy! The essence of men is hypocrisy! Filth! Shamelessness! Despicableness! Bastards! He is simply better at pretending than Shen Wuxueyan! He deserves to die even more than Shen Wuxueyan! Even more!"

Upon hearing the name "Shen Wuxueyan," Shen Wumingque's pupils constricted... In that instant, she suddenly understood why God Venerable Wuming harbored such murderous intent toward Yun Che, a man with whom she had no quarrel.

"Shen Wuxueyan... Shen Wuxueyan... Shen Wuxueyan!!" God Venerable Wuming herself seemed to be pierced to the soul by the name. Her aura grew chaotic, and her voice became as shrill as a demented ghost's.

"All the men in this world are Shen Wuxueyan! They are all heartless beasts... They all deserve to die!"

Shen Wumingque bowed her head deeply, not daring to say another word. She could only sigh inwardly at Yun Che's extreme misfortune. He had unintentionally touched upon this madwoman's most untouchable scar.

"Wuyi, are you alright?" Shen Wuyouluan helped Shen Wuyi sit down, checking her injuries with concern.

"I'm fine."

Shen Wuyi shook her head lightly. Her face was a shade pale, but her cold, stunning beauty remained as breathtaking as ever. "Mother God did not strike me heavily. I will recover before we enter the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain."

Shen Wuyouluan sighed softly. "You knew the consequences of defying her, so why did you still..."

Shen Wuyi's voice was gentle. Despite being fiercely reprimanded and punished, she held no regrets. "If we can just find the Abyssal Heart Vine, my Mother God's divine body will have a chance to recover. Then, she will be able to see my face clearly, see the Evernight God Kingdom she now rules. Her lifespan will also be extended several times over, allowing me to accompany her for much longer."

"Therefore, even the faintest glimmer of hope is far more important than a little growth for myself."

As she spoke, her left eyelashes trembled in a minuscule arc with the surge of her emotions. This subtle tremor was clearly seen by Shen Wuyouluan, who was close to her.

"Silly child."

Shen Wuyouluan gently embraced her, her voice filled with heartache. "I know you feel wronged... This is the Pure Land; the God Venerable's spiritual sense cannot extend here freely. If you feel wronged, just let it all out. Don't keep it bottled up inside and hurt yourself."

"I don't feel wronged."

Shen Wuyi rested her head lightly against Shen Wuyouluan's chest, a faint smile on her lips. "Actually, I've always known that Mother God's strictness is for my own good. Otherwise, I wouldn't have achieved what I have in just twenty years. It's just that she was once wounded by sincerity, so she cannot allow herself to believe in its existence again."

She closed her eyes slightly and sighed. "Sometimes, I even wish Mother God would place the 'Evernight Death-Seeking Mark' on me as well. Perhaps then, I could earn more of her trust."

"How can you think that way?"

Shen Wuyouluan whispered, her heart aching. "Your talent is the most precious treasure of the Evernight God Kingdom. How could it be marred by the Evernight Death-Seeking Mark?"

"So..." Shen Wuyi looked up, her eyes shimmering with an incredibly deep hope. "Mother God does care for me after all, doesn't she?"

"I don't know."

Shen Wuyouluan replied, "No one can fathom the God Venerable's thoughts. Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't. But everyone has seen how pure and sincere your feelings for her are, and we are all moved by it. I believe that one day, the God Venerable will believe in sincerity again."

After a brief silence, Shen Wuyi slowly shook her head. "No, Mother God's loss of trust in all living things is a form of self-protection. I don't need her to try and change for my sake. I only hope she can be truly happy, truly healthy and well."

"This time, when I enter the God-Slumbering Forbidden Domain, I will do everything in my power to find the Abyssal Heart Vine. If I cannot... I will find a way to create more opportunities to enter again. There will come a day when I succeed."

"Alright."

Shen Wuyouluan smiled. "It is written that the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass not only possesses the purest, most flawless soul but is also blessed by the Heavenly Way. I believe your devotion will surely move the heavens and help you achieve your wish."

At that moment, an intangible soul presence quietly spread.

From within the jet-black palanquin, a series of low hisses could be heard. "How could there be true feelings in this filthy world... How could there be... true... feelings..."

The final words seemed to carry the hint of a soft sob.

"Yun Che, you must remember... your will, your actions, they concern everything about you, and the life and death of everything in this world!"

"Therefore, in the World of the Abyss, whether it is friendship, the bond between master and disciple, the love between a man and a woman, or even gratitude toward a benefactor... they can only be tools for you to use. You absolutely cannot allow even a sliver of genuine emotion to be mixed in!"

"You know your own character. If you develop true feelings, you will inevitably be bound by them! But the consequence of such bonds... will very likely be your own damnation, and the eternal damnation of this world!"

"In the Abyss, all feelings are heartless!"

"All feelings are heartless!"

"Otherwise... eternal damnation!"

"Eternal damnation!"

"..."

In a dark and murky world, Chi Wuyao's voice echoed. Her voice, her warnings, resounded in his soul countless times each day. Even in a deep coma, every fiber of his soul relentlessly alerted him. The moment his consciousness began to stir, his soul-strings tensed, and he struggled desperately to wake up.

How... can I be unconscious!

In the World of the Abyss, any lapse was an unforgivable sin. How could he allow his consciousness to sink into such a pathetic state?

Vaguely, he heard a young girl's voice. "Master is lying again. It clearly hurts so much, but he still says it doesn't hurt."

It was Hong'er's voice.

"Master won't even let us out to play anymore, and he's become such a liar. But before, Sister Jasmine and Sister Heling both said that lying is what bad children do, and you should never lie." It was still Hong'er's voice.

"You can't... say... bad things... about Master." This was You'er's voice, soft, sweet, and halting.

Following that was a soft sigh from Li Suo. "Lies are indeed not good things. But sometimes, behind a lie hides a helplessness too heavy to bear. And that kind of lie often wounds the liar first."

Li Suo was the first to sense the turbulent struggle in his soul sea.

"He... is about to wake up."

Amidst his violent struggle, Yun Che's eyes snapped open, his pupils reflecting a blurry, piercing light.

"Ah!"

A girl's gasp sounded by his ear, followed by a joyous cry. "Big Brother Yun, you... you're awake."

His vision filled with Hua Caili's jade-like face, a face beautiful enough to eclipse the heavens and earth of the Pure Land. Her eyes shimmered with tears, like shattered starlight. Her cheeks were streaked with moisture, so tragically beautiful it could break a heart of stone in an instant.

"How long... was I asleep?" He tentatively tried to raise his hand. Fortunately, the weakness in his body wasn't severe, which allowed him to relax completely.

Hua Caili quickly reached out and gently held his injured hand. "Three shichen³. Big Brother Yun, close your eyes again and rest well. Don't try to be strong. I'll be right here."

"Three shichen..."

He murmured the words, then wiggled his fingers, taking her somewhat cold, snow-white hand in his. He looked into her eyes and smiled gently. "So, you've been teary-eyed like this for a whole three shichen? No wonder the books say that women are made of water.⁴"

"You... you still dare to smile!"

Hua Caili was both embarrassed and annoyed. Her jade-like fingers tightened slightly, but in the end, she couldn't bear to truly hurt him. She could only force a resentful expression. "I'm really angry this time, exceptionally angry!"

Yun Che suddenly clutched his chest, his face contorting in pain. "Ah, it hurts, it hurts... It hurts so much!"

The girl's budding anger instantly turned to panic. She was at a complete loss. "Where... where does it hurt? Is it an internal injury? How could this be..."

Yun Che grimaced. "When my Caili gets angry, my heart aches. Ah, it hurts so much, more than the Desolate Gnawing Punishment! Hiss... ah!"

"You, you..." Hua Caili didn't know whether to laugh or be angry. She could only bite her lip and scratch his chest forcefully with her fingers, earning an exceptionally exaggerated yelp from him.

But after the yelp, the pain on Yun Che's face vanished. He reached out with both hands, cradling the girl's hands in his palms, his gaze gentle yet firm. "As long as my Caili is safe and sound, nothing in this world can truly cause me pain."

"But, it hurts me." The five simple words ended in a soft, girlish sob.

She rested her head lightly on Yun Che's chest, listening to his heartbeat. "We clearly agreed to bear everything together, but you..."

"Ahem, ahem!" Meng Kongchan stood at the door, leaning halfway in, his face a mask of seriousness to hide his awkwardness... Perhaps I've come at a bad time?

Hua Caili shot up, a rosy blush on her cheeks. "Uncle Meng."

"Mm."

Meng Kongchan grunted seriously and gave an elder's nod. His eyes swept over Yun Che. "Your recovery speed is astonishing. Caili should be able to rest easy now."

He glanced at Hua Caili with a faint smile. "This little girl, for all her fame as the Heaven-Folding Divine Maiden, cried her eyes out. She nearly drowned me and her father."

The pink on her snowy face instantly deepened to a more vibrant crimson. The girl bowed her head low, softly protesting, "It... it wasn't as exaggerated as Uncle Meng says."

"Hahahaha!"

Meng Kongchan couldn't help but laugh heartily.

"Senior."

Yun Che suddenly spoke, his face filled with remorse. "My actions were ill-considered and caused a great deal of trouble for you and God Venerable Huaxin. I never expected..."

Meng Kongchan waved a hand, cutting him off. "By enduring the Desolate Gnawing Punishment alone, you've managed to win the approval of most people for your Caili. Even the Abyssal Monarch publicly announced the annulment of the engagement. This is already the best possible outcome."

"As for the affairs of us elders, you need not worry." As he spoke, he turned his back... afraid that Yun Che's overly sharp gaze would catch the gloom in his eyes.

Just then, an aged voice came from outside. "This old one, Long Zhiming, is about to leave the Pure Land and has come especially to bid farewell to the Abyssal God Child. I wonder if the Abyssal God Child has awakened?"

Yun Che's spirits lifted slightly, and he immediately said, "Senior, I have deep ties with the Dragon Clan. For the Dragon Lord to come and bid farewell personally, he must have something to say."

Meng Kongchan nodded and stepped out. A short while later, the Dragon Lord arrived alone, carrying the ancient and heavy aura of an Ancestor Dragon.

Yun Che's condition was stable. While Meng Kongchan felt a sense of relief, his heart remained endlessly heavy. On Eden's Cloud Crest, Dian Luohou's furious roars and accusations still echoed in his ears.

Yun Che had conquered everyone, including the High Priest, with his world-shocking willpower, shattering the seemingly insurmountable obstacles between him and Hua Caili... But as everyone's perception of them shifted from negative to positive, for the Senluo God Kingdom and for Dian Luohou, it was undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire, insult to injury. He knew Dian Luohou's roars were justified... The two people he trusted most had dealt him the greatest betrayal and humiliation of his life.

Sigh!

With a heavy sigh, his eyes suddenly caught a glimpse of a green figure.

"Qingying."

He was overjoyed and called out subconsciously.

"Yun Che is awake?" Hua Qingying asked faintly.

"He's awake." Meng Kongchan took a few steps forward, feigning a casual tone. "The boy's body is quite tough..."

"That's good." As her words fell, the green figure had already soared far into the sky, leaving the God Venerable Wumeng with his sentence unfinished.

"Uh..."

Meng Kongchan subconsciously raised a hand, then could only let it fall with a sigh.

At that moment, an unexpected aura approached rapidly. Meng Kongchan's expression hardened. He turned slowly to face a man clad in cold silver armor, with a resolute face and a formidable presence.

"Abyssal Knight Dugu Zhuyuan, paying respects to God Venerable Wumeng. I have come on the orders of the Abyssal Monarch to bring Yun Che to the Eden Sacred Hall for an audience."

Meng Kongchan's calm and imposing expression instantly changed, his brows knitting together sharply. "What did you say? The Abyssal Monarch!?"
