Facing Pan Bu Zhuo's treacherous feints and sudden instantaneous movements, Sha Xing, despite his wide-open vulnerabilities, remained completely unperturbed. His body spun, and the incredibly heavy Heavenly Wolf Devouring Star¹ instantly traced a light, crescent-moon trajectory. A roaring shadow of a Heavenly Wolf² burst forth from the moon's arc, charging straight into the sky full of demonic crows. This was precisely the Heavenly Wolf's first sword strike, the Heavenly Wolf Slash!

High above, Pan Bu Zhuo's figure had once again blurred into an illusion. His true body had already plunged diagonally downwards, like a dim star stripped from a lightless abyss. The Cold Crow Demonic Spear³ tore through a bizarre, dark trajectory, aiming directly for Sha Xing's back.

Boom! Clang!

The roaring Heavenly Wolf plunged into the swarm of crows, and the demonic spear collided with the massive sword. The dull sound of energy annihilation, mixed with ear-splitting explosions, rolled across the sky like thunder, making everyone's ears buzz and souls tremble. Demonic crows hunted the Heavenly Wolf, and the Heavenly Wolf tore at the demonic crows. Pan Bu Zhuo's demonic spear unleashed countless afterimages in an instant, forcing Sha Xing to retreat step by step, yet he could never truly pierce through the Heavenly Wolf's immense power. The demonic crows' shrieks grew more piercing, tearing open black cracks in the azure Heavenly Wolf's shadow; but each swing of the Heavenly Wolf's claws would obliterate a demonic crow into scattered dark dust.

Separated by the barrier, the spectators could faintly feel a suffocating might and bone-chilling cold. It could be said that no one had expected Pan Bu Zhuo to gain the upper hand first in this battle.

"No wonder Divine Venerable Qi Heng⁴ not only discarded the former God Child Pan Bu Wang⁵, but also, to prevent him from causing trouble for the new God Child, resolutely expelled him from the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom⁶."

Divine Venerable Qiong Yue, Wu Shen Yue⁷, spoke softly, her gentle voice making it hard to discern if it was pure praise or hidden mockery: "This Pan Bu Zhuo not only surpasses Pan Bu Wang in divinity, but his dark talent also far exceeds his."

Pan Yu Sheng⁸ did not turn his head, completely ignoring her. Divine Venerable Wu Shen Xing⁹ smiled faintly, showing no concern. Because everyone knew that although Pan Bu Zhuo had the initial advantage, he was ultimately destined to lose. Although Dark Profound Energy¹⁰ was immensely powerful, its cultivation was more difficult than other profound energies due to the scarcity of dark elements in the Abyss World. More fatally, Dark Profound Energy was not only difficult to control but also prone to backfiring. Even a Divine Venerable could never achieve complete affinity with Dark Profound Energy. This naturally led to profound practitioners of the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom almost never being able to defeat profound practitioners of other Divine Kingdoms at the same cultivation level. This held true even at the level of Divine Venerables and God Children. Consequently, throughout the history of the Six Divine Kingdoms, the overall strength of the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom had always been at the bottom. Therefore, Sha Xing's proactive challenge to Pan Bu Zhuo was not really an act that would add glory.

Victory was expected, but if he lost, he would lose all face.

Boom!

The Heavenly Wolf vanished, the demonic crows were annihilated, and azure and darkness violently intertwined, then erupted simultaneously. As the light dimmed and brightened again, the figures of the two God Children finally separated, then landed simultaneously, gazing at each other from a distance. Sha Xing held his greatsword, his posture as unwavering as at the beginning, his body from head to sword tip completely still. Only his eyes were like those of a bloodthirsty, violent wolf. Pan Bu Zhuo's hand gripping the spear trembled slightly, slowly stopping after several breaths. Dark light surged around him, like ripples in a chaotic wind, releasing an eerie demonic might, but also revealing the external manifestation of his Dark Profound Energy not being fully controlled.

"Heh!"

Pan Bu Zhuo sneered, "Star God Child¹¹, I'm very curious, what benefit did that good-for-nothing Pan Bu Wang give you, or what leverage did he have over you, that you would be willing to 'risk your life' for him to this extent?"

His sarcastic taunts did not stir Sha Xing in the slightest: "He is my friend. No matter what identity he held in the past, holds now, or will hold in the future, he is my friend."

"To insult my friend is to insult me!"

He raised his sword, pointing it directly at Pan Bu Zhuo's dark eyes: "Are you satisfied with this answer?"

"Heh heh, ridiculous!"

Pan Bu Zhuo chuckled disdainfully: "Before Pan Bu Wang was expelled, he was a good-for-nothing that even dogs could step on. And you, at least you're a God Child... Tsk, such cheap words and actions are truly an eye-opener."

"Heh!"

Sha Xing's lips curled slightly; he seemed to be smiling, but his eyes shot forth a bloodthirsty ferocity: "Your Divine Father¹² doesn't seem to have taught you... the consequences of enraging a Heavenly Wolf!"

"Is that so?"

Pan Bu Zhuo showed no fear: "I heard that Star God Child broke his spine in the Mist Sea some time ago, almost ending his path as a God Child. Don't let your impulsiveness cause your old injury to relapse."

"Even a wolf with a broken spine can easily crush you, a crow with rotten feathers!"

Roar!

A wolf's howl, utterly domineering and carrying a divine might that looked down upon heaven and earth, erupted. Profound light burst from Sha Xing, transforming into a Heavenly Wolf giant shadow several times larger than before. Its wolf eyes were crimson, its fangs chilling, and its wolf body flowed with a condensed, substantial torrent of power.

"Hmph!" Pan Bu Zhuo slowly rotated his arm back, dark demonic patterns rapidly spreading around him, instantly transforming into thousands of black demonic crows that completely engulfed his figure. This time, Sha Xing attacked first. Seven Star God Shattered Shadows¹³, seven instantaneous movements in a single moment, had already brought him within ten zhang¹⁴. The Heavenly Wolf Devouring Star slashed, creating spatial ripples, and struck down heavily... The giant azure wolf shadow behind him also opened its heaven-devouring maw, tearing down along the sword's trajectory.

Rumble!

The Eden Cloud Peak¹⁵ was swept by a storm, smoke and clouds completely dispersed. Amidst thunderous roars and shrieks, two figures, one black and one blue, intertwined and flew within the storm. Each collision was accompanied by spatial tremors, and the sounds of the Heavenly Wolf and demonic crows were like a symphony of disaster, continuously assaulting everyone's ears. Everyone watched in silence, no one spoke.

Until a certain moment, Yun Che¹⁶ heard Meng Kong Chan's¹⁷ voice transmission: "Pan Bu Zhuo's offensive is exhausted, his defense is about to collapse. Within ten breaths, victory will be decided."

ROAR!!

No sooner had Meng Kong Chan's words fallen than a Heavenly Wolf's roar, far louder than before, suddenly exploded, shattering the clouds and causing ripples of distortion in space. The dark profound light was instantly torn open, creating a huge gap, and Pan Bu Zhuo's figure plummeted from the opening. When he barely managed to stop in mid-air, several streaks of crimson blood had already spilled from the corners of his lips.

He gritted his teeth fiercely, and darkness surged from his body... But, simultaneously with the burst of power came the backlash of darkness devouring his body due to his injuries, and the pain of his profound veins feeling as if they were being pierced by thousands of steel needles. In that momentary lapse of focus, the massive sword body and the Heavenly Wolf's shadow rapidly magnified in his pupils. The dark aura around him instantly receded like a tide, and even his soul recoiled for a moment. Pan Bu Zhuo leaned back, veins bulging on his forehead and arms. His demonic spear shot through the air, unleashing a thousand spear shadows in an instant. Demonic light and blue shadows collided chaotically, but this time, almost only sounds of destructive explosions were heard. The devouring sound of darkness, along with the thousands of spear shadows, was layer by layer destroyed and disintegrated. Even the demonic light of the Cold Crow Demonic Spear rapidly dimmed.

Bang!

The last of the demonic light was also pulverized into scattered dark ashes, and his protective profound energy was completely shattered. Pan Bu Zhuo grunted, and his entire body was sent flying. His black God Child's robe was largely torn, revealing bone-deep wounds. But before he could land, Sha Xing, stepping with Star God Shattered Shadows, had already caught up. The Heavenly Wolf Devouring Star, carrying destructive power without mercy, struck directly at Pan Bu Zhuo's head.

Pan Bu Zhuo fiercely gritted his teeth. The blood and intense pain fueled the dark power that had already begun to recede. With his hoarse, exhausted roar, a black shadow burst from the demonic spear. As it spread its wings, it transformed into a hundred-zhang¹⁸ demonic crow. Its feathers were ink-black, its beak and claws glowed eerily, instantly covering the sky and sun, engulfing Sha Xing and the Heavenly Wolf's illusion in its dark feathers. The light suddenly dimmed, then abruptly flashed bright in the next instant.

A dazzling, piercing azure arc pierced through heaven and earth, splitting the hundred-zhang demonic crow in half like divine punishment. The demonic crow let out an extremely shrill and tragic cry, its feathers scattering like black snow. Reflected above was a thousand-zhang wolf shadow with eyes like an abyss, filled with rage. Its massive wolf claws passed through the disintegrating dark dust and smashed down.

Boom!

Amidst the thunderous crash, the Cold Crow Demonic Spear flew out of his hand. Its shaft, wrapped in residual demonic light, plunged directly into the clouds outside the barrier, causing a dull hum. But the Heavenly Wolf's subsequent strength also seemed difficult to sustain; its remaining power only barely made Pan Bu Zhuo stumble.

He had just regained his footing, before he could even catch his breath for a moment, when Sha Xing's eyes, full of malice, suddenly reflected in his own.

"He who insults others will always be insulted by others!"¹⁹

Boom!

The low murmur pierced his soul. The Heavenly Wolf Devouring Star heavily smashed onto Pan Bu Zhuo's head. As if thousands of wasps were buzzing in his head, Sha Xing spun and flew out, then his head hit the ground, his face plowing the ground for ten thousand zhang before he finally stopped.

"Owl Butterfly Pan Bu Zhuo has left the barrier. Star Moon Sha Xing wins." The Grand Divine Official²⁰ announced the result expressionlessly, his voice cold and hard. The Abyss Emperor²¹ offered no comment.

Pan Bu Zhuo lost. No one found this result surprising. But few had expected him to lose... or rather, for Star God Child to make him lose so ugly and unsightly. That sword strike that sent Pan Bu Zhuo flying out of the barrier, the dignified God Child of Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom, used his face to scrape ten thousand zhang of shallow marks on the ground of Eden Cloud Peak. When he struggled to get up, half of his right face was already bloody and mangled.

The injuries were minor, but such humiliation would be unbearable even for an ordinary person, let alone a God Child! He slowly turned his head. Even with the Abyss Emperor and the Grand Divine Official present, he could not conceal the momentary gnashing hatred in his eyes as he looked at Sha Xing.

"Good!!"

Divine Venerable Dian Luo Hou²² praised without reservation: "At such an age and cultivation, to be able to unleash the fierce dominance of the Heavenly Wolf Prison God Canon²³ to this extent, Divine Venerable Tian Xing²⁴, this young man has probably surpassed you in your prime."

Divine Venerable Wu Shen Xing smiled faintly: "Divine Venerable Jue Luo²⁵ overpraises. This young man is still very green; his control over the Heavenly Wolf's divine power is still far from perfect, otherwise, he wouldn't have lost his sense of propriety like this."

"Sha Xing."

His voice became stern: "The battle of God Children is primarily to display one's demeanor to the Abyss Emperor, and secondarily for sparring. How could you injure the Owl Butterfly God Child to such an extent? Hurry and apologize!!"

"Yes, Master!!"

Sha Xing immediately responded, then cleanly and swiftly bowed towards the direction of the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom: "Owl Butterfly God Child, this junior's skills are not refined, and there are many oversights in my control of power. I never intended to injure the Owl Butterfly God Child to this extent, and I am truly filled with guilt and terror. I humbly ask for the Owl Butterfly God Child's magnanimity and forgiveness."

"If... the Owl Butterfly God Child still finds it difficult to let go, after this Pure Land Assembly²⁶, this junior will personally visit the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom to apologize in person."

Pan Yu Sheng spoke calmly: "Divine Venerable Tian Xing and Star God Child are overstating. Battles between God Children should naturally be fought without reservation; injuries are inevitable. You truly don't need to take it to heart. To act like this, on the contrary, makes my Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom seem petty."

Sha Xing immediately interjected: "This junior is terrified, I absolutely had no such intention."

Everyone could see that Sha Xing's final sword strike was deliberately meant to make Pan Bu Zhuo lose so unsightly, a direct and obvious humiliation. Everyone could hear that Sha Xing was outwardly apologizing, but in reality, subtly mocking. Everyone also knew that the people of Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom were well aware of this.

However, no one from the Owl Butterfly Divine Kingdom, from top to bottom, reacted. Because the loser had no right to talk about dignity. If they forced a reaction, they would only lose their last bit of face.

Pan Bu Zhuo had already risen. Despite cracks all over his body and his right face stained with blood, he stood ramrod straight, showing no trace of anger or discomfiture on his face: "Star God Child's teachings, I, Pan Bu Zhuo, have taken note of them. I will certainly take today as an encouragement, and when we next cross paths..."

"Next time we cross paths, this junior will surely have learned to properly control his power, and will do his utmost... to make the Owl Butterfly God Child lose more gracefully." Sha Xing looked at Pan Bu Zhuo, speaking with exceptional gentleness and politeness, and with an air of complete justification. When he recognized someone as a friend, no matter how their identity changed, they would remain his friend. Similarly, when he decided to offend someone, he would offend them thoroughly, with no need to save face or leave any room for reconciliation. He was the Star God Child; beneath the Pure Land, who was qualified to make him wary!

"..."

Pan Bu Zhuo's brows furrowed deeply, and the face that was stubbornly maintaining calm and pride cracked slightly.

"Although I, Sha Xing, am unaccomplished, but..."

He looked at Pan Bu Zhuo, his posture still calm and polite, but his words were firm and decisive, allowing no room for doubt: "...I am not so worthless as to lose to an Owl Butterfly God Child of the same cultivation level."

"Sha Xing!"

Divine Venerable Wu Shen Xing angrily rebuked: "Talking nonsense! Retreat at once!"

Pan Yu Sheng's expression darkened slightly, but he said nothing. In a dispute among juniors, as a Divine Venerable, Wu Shen Xing could reprimand Sha Xing, but he could not. Pan Bu Zhuo did not speak, but his hands had begun to tremble slightly.

Between Divine Kingdoms, there had always been no deep-seated hatred, and they would always more or less save face for each other... with the exception of the Eternal Night Divine Kingdom²⁷ after Shen Wu Yan Ye²⁸ became its Venerable. Since Pan Bu Zhuo became the Owl Butterfly God Child, when had he ever suffered such naked contempt and humiliation... and on the Pure Land, in front of the Abyss Emperor and the six Divine Kingdoms! The greatest contempt in all of this was that Sha Xing showed absolutely no fear of making an enemy of him! It was imaginable to what unbearable extent his face had been trampled in everyone's eyes at this moment. And behind all of this, it was merely for Pan Bu Wang, who in his eyes was like a stray dog!!

He slowly inhaled, forcefully composing himself, and was about to retort sharply when a chilling voice, carrying a dark aura, coldly rang out: "Star God Child, publicly belittling my Owl Butterfly God Child like this, aren't you afraid your own arrogance will backfire and harm your own face?!"

This voice made Pan Bu Zhuo freeze. And Sha Xing was even more stunned, a flicker of bewilderment flashing in his eyes... as if for a moment he couldn't believe his own ears. He slowly turned around, his movements visibly stiff... As his gaze fell, he saw that familiar figure in black, slowly walking out from behind the Star Moon Divine Kingdom.

It was none other than... Pan Bu Wang!

This sudden scene astonished everyone. Divine Venerable Tian Xing and Divine Venerable Qi Heng simultaneously frowned slightly... but the emotions stirring in their hearts were vastly different.

"Brother Bu Wang, what did you... just say?" Sha Xing looked at Pan Bu Wang. He, who had been full of arrogance even when facing Divine Venerable Qi Heng, now had trembling eyes. His first reaction was to doubt his own hearing, unable to believe that the voice had come from Pan Bu Wang, whom he considered a friend and for whom he was willing to offend a God Child of another Divine Kingdom to vent his anger.
