The abnormal behavior of profound energy beneath the Glazed Glass Ice was, in truth, not unfamiliar to Yun Che.
 
Because he bore within him the primordial Dragon God bloodline, he was the absolute nemesis of all dragons in existence. Not only would his soul inspire fear in all those belonging to the dragon race, but even the power that dragons unleashed against him would uncontrollably shrink back.
 
In the God Realm, Long Bai—who likewise possessed the Dragon God bloodline and had once stood as the supreme existence of that age—had his power weaken by nearly thirty percent before it even reached Yun Che’s body.
 
The result was similar, but the nature of it was utterly different. Faced with the Glazed Glass Ice, profound energy did not cower and grow feeble; instead… it naturally withdrew, as though it had gained some strange spiritual awareness.
 
It did not defend against it, and it could not bear to wound it.
 
Thus, the power of the Glazed Glass Ice itself was not overwhelming. Yet because of its primordial origin and its extremely special, ultimate purity, it “weakened” the power of others to an immense degree at the conceptual level.
 
It was this that allowed Shenwu Yi, with only the sixth level of the Divine Extinction Realm, to easily withstand the power of Great Rage from the eighth level of the Divine Extinction Realm—and even more easily pierce through Dian Jiuzhi’s suddenly sluggish protective profound energy.
 
Yun Che murmured under his breath, “So this is the true form of the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass…”
 
Just like the Nine Profound Exquisite Body, he had long since known the name “Heart of Snow Glazed Glass,” and the rumors and records concerning it were even more jumbled and chaotic. Among them, a few points were relatively accepted: its heart and soul were crystal-clear; it was protected by the Heavenly Way; once it “awakened,” the bearer would surely be king or emperor, with a destiny far beyond the ordinary.
 
Of these, the claim that it was protected by the Heavenly Way was mentioned most often—some firmly believed it, while others scoffed.
 
All those rumors and records were, without a doubt, a synthesis of the traits manifested by all those throughout history who had possessed the Heart of Snow Glazed Glass. But as for where it truly originated, or why it bore the name “Glazed Glass,” no one knew, and no record ever mentioned it… Its true essence had already been buried in foul dust before even the Era of the Gods had truly arrived, severed from the world forever.
 
Her Exquisite Body and Glazed Glass Heart had also manifested quite clearly in the original world. They had allowed her to transcend laws, to see through the deviousness of the human heart and to scheme on a grand scale despite her exceedingly shallow experience… Yet neither had ever truly explained what “Exquisite” meant, nor what “Glazed Glass” meant.
 
So it turned out that, in the God Realm, whether her Exquisite Body or her Glazed Glass Heart, their growth and awakening had been nothing more than a sprout.
 
But… why?
 
In the mere few decades since she fell into the Abyss, why had such a tremendous change taken place upon her?
 
*The Ancestral God’s creation… the Ancestral God’s sacred aura… a causeless person…*
 
*Worlds utterly severed, karma cut off forever—she is no longer a vessel of fate, no longer has any past, no longer has any memory of what once was…*
 
*Then… is she still her…?*
 
*Now, should I be calling her Shenwu Yi…*
 
*Or… selfishly… force her to remember the name “Xia Qingyue,” and drag her back to the destiny she once had as “Xia Qingyue”…*
 
Facing the second Glazed Glass profound seal, Dian Jiuzhi seemed intent on proving something. He directly lifted his hand and reached out to seize it.
 
The Glazed Glass profound seal did not twist space; it collided straight against Dian Jiuzhi’s arm.
 
With a crack like shattering ice, the Glazed Glass profound seal broke apart in midair… yet the terrifying cold still pierced straight into his bones, causing the blood in his arm to halt abruptly, his profound energy to stagnate, and his arm to stiffen in midair for an instant.
 
This time, Dian Jiuzhi clearly sensed that even though that power was obviously only at the sixth level of the Divine Extinction Realm, the power of Great Rage he had unleashed had actually blocked less than half of it.
 
His body, which should have been incomparably tough, also seemed to have become extraordinarily fragile, ending up sealed to such an extent.
 
His profound energy, his body, seemed to have suddenly lost the instinct to repel external forces, lazily allowing this icy power to invade.
 
An endless sense of absurdity stacked upon itself again and again in his soul sea. The world within the barrier felt like a bizarre, glazed illogical dream.
 
A sharp ray of cold light stabbed into his pupils. In that fresh moment of distraction, Shenwu Yi’s third Glazed Glass profound seal had already taken form. It was the Dust-Cleansing Seal. Though only one zhang wide (roughly 3.3 meters), it descended with a chill that covered a thousand zhang (roughly 3.3 kilometers).
 
Dian Jiuzhi closed his eyes… This time, he even directly sealed off his five senses.
 
*Unavoidable, unknowable, undefendable… then I will not see, not hear, not feel!*
 
*Thus, there will be no sensation, no shock, no fear.*
 
*Even if I have already paraded my ugliness before all, I absolutely must not… disgrace the dignity of the Boundless Kingdom of God!*
 
Bang!
 
The power of Great Rage surged wildly, making the blood burst from both his arms as skin and flesh split open. It practically tore straight through his arms that had gone rigid from the cold. The dim silver radiance also erupted at this moment, swelling like a blazing silver sun, completely engulfing his figure.
 
The Glazed Glass Dust-Cleansing Seal came crashing down from above, sealing off the space where he stood. With his five senses sealed, Dian Jiuzhi perceived nothing. Only the rampaging power of Great Rage transformed into a ten-zhang-tall (~33 meters) giant shadow… and from that ten-zhang (~33 meters) shadow spread a spiritual pressure so terrifying that even a ten-thousand-zhang (~33 kilometers) giant mountain could not compare.
 
Bang!!
 
The Glazed Glass Dust-Cleansing Seal slammed down like a star falling from beyond the heavens. Under the crystalline ice light, the intense silver radiance revealed layer upon layer of strange ripples, like streaks of water neatly parted.
 
By the time the Glazed Glass Dust-Cleansing Seal passed through the silver glow, the ice light had only been diminished by roughly sixty percent, and then it exploded violently against Dian Jiuzhi’s body.
 
The ice light bloomed within the silver radiance, causing it to twist violently. The sealing of his profound energy made the ten-zhang (~33 meters) shadow abruptly shrink to seven zhang (~23 meters).
 
This time, the cold pierced not only bone, but soul as well. However, it no longer brought Dian Jiuzhi any surprise or cowering. He did not even attempt to disperse the cold, maintaining his five senses sealed. The seven-zhang-tall (~23 meters) shadow raised its fist and struck the void, unleashing a berserk power drawn from the Great Rage God Veins.
 
“Boundless Myriad Manifestations—Great Rage Devours the Stars!!”
 
BOOM——
 
Silver radiance flooded the sky. Even the barrier was unable to block the overly blazing light of destruction in that instant, which shone directly over all of Eden’s Crown.
 
Cries of alarm rose all around. Yun Che's gaze tightened; he clearly saw that within the sky-filling destructive silver glow, there was a one-zhang-wide (~3.3 meters) gap.
 
That gap reflected pure, immaculate ice light, and within it stood Shenwu Yi, completely unharmed. Whenever the surrounding surging power of destruction touched the ice light, it would transform into gentle, harmless streams of light that bent away, unable to invade in the slightest.
 
One breath, two breaths, three breaths…
 
It was clearly a might that could destroy heaven and earth, yet it still could not shatter or damage this seemingly fragile ice crystal.
 
The silver radiance gradually faded, and the battlefield within the barrier reappeared.
 
Shenwu Yi held her sword, condensing ice along its blade. As the sword light danced, a four-leaf-shaped profound seal quickly took form. The instant it completed, it shed all color, leaving only crystalline Glazed Glass clarity.
 
“Heart‑Purifying Seal… Hiss! Just what level has she cultivated it to?!” Meng Jianxi cried in shock.
 
At the same time, the power of Great Rage, which had briefly paused, erupted once more—and seemed even more violent than before.
 
This time the silver radiance coiling around Dian Jiuzhi’s body took on a strange rippling pattern, like roaring lightning, like a raging sea in upheaval.
 
The instant the Glazed Glass Heart‑Purifying Seal descended, his power erupted in turn. From his soul sea spilled a low murmur that only he could hear:
 
“Boundless Myriad Manifestations—Rage Ruins Crush the Seas!”
 
The moment the power of Great Rage surged wildly, the space within the barrier—and even all the gazes cast toward it—were instantly twisted and bent.
 
The Glazed Glass Heart‑Purifying Seal and the power of Great Rage engulfed each other almost simultaneously.
 
An explosion of ice resounded in Dian Jiuzhi’s soul sea. He felt his soul itself become chillingly cold, and the profound energy in his body seemed to be blocked layer upon layer, turning incomparably sluggish.
 
Yet he still did not release his five senses to examine the injuries on his body. He concentrated all his will on urging the power within his Great Rage God Veins.
 
The eighth level of the Divine Extinction Realm against the sixth… Even if he lost, he absolutely could not lose too disgracefully.
 
Layer upon layer of rippling destructive power annihilated everything within the barrier. The space of Eden’s Crown was unimaginably tough, yet faint, shallow cracks surfaced as if about to split.
 
The power completely submerged the battlefield so thoroughly that it made no difference where Shenwu Yi stood. Wherever those destructive ripples touched the Glazed Glass ice crystals, they would suddenly, like a stream of water severed by a blade, split and stream past to either side.
 
Ever-thickening layers of ice spread over Dian Jiuzhi’s body, and the color of his face drained rapidly… Meanwhile, Shenwu Yi’s Glazed Glass barrier finally lost its tranquility for the first time, fine seams of ice appearing upon it.
 
The fissures were slight, yet on the overly flawless ice crystal they were particularly eye-catching.
 
Shenwu Yi’s expression did not change. Her pair of icy eyes reflected a deeper, stranger light. At once, the cracks on the Glazed Glass ice crystals began to slowly mend at a speed visible to the naked eye… then slowly spread again. Between advance and retreat, they seemed to have reached a temporary equilibrium.
 
As the silver radiance dimmed once more, the tide of destruction began to ebb.
 
Dian Jiuzhi’s right arm slowly lifted, his movement noticeably stiff. The silver glow that had yet to dissipate suddenly flared up again. As his right arm crashed down toward the ground, his body—whose previous might had not yet fully faded—actually erupted once more with a power of destruction not the least bit weaker than before.
 
“Boundless Myriad Manifestations—Eight Rages Shatter the World!”
 
In that instant, space shook violently, silver radiance blazing across the firmament as though heaven and earth had been flipped upside down.
 
Under the seamless eruption of the power of Great Rage, the ice marks on the Glazed Glass barrier—almost entirely gone—suddenly surged, in the space of a heartbeat spreading over more than half the barrier. Then, with an unstoppable momentum, they slowly extended, gradually outlining the shape of the entire ice crystal.
 
One breath, two breaths, three breaths… four breaths… five breaths!!
 
Clang!
 
The silver glow finally died, and at the very last instant before it vanished, the mysterious Glazed Glass barrier at last shattered. The final trace of the power of Great Rage brushed heavily against Shenwu Yi’s body, causing a fleeting pallor to appear on her indifferent jade-like face, and a thin line of blood to spill from the corner of her lips…
 
But that was all.
 
In the next instant, however, her pupils seemed to condense the abyssal chill of ten thousand ages. The Heart-Severing Thorn in her left hand shot forth with a burst of colorless ice light. As it tore through the air, layers of ice petals bloomed along its path. By the time it neared Dian Jiuzhi, it had become a fully blossomed, dreamlike ice crystal snow lotus.
 
BOOM——
 
The ice crystal snow lotus shattered upon Dian Jiuzhi’s body, dispersing into a sky of ice rain that refracted gorgeous crystalline light.
 
Dian Jiuzhi’s body, just about to forcibly urge the power of Great Rage once more, instantly went rigid. The silver radiance that had been struggling to leap also froze in place, then, like a bubble suddenly bursting, vanished in an instant.
 
His soul sea had become a frozen, deathly stillness. All his perception, wherever it reached, touched only endless ice-cold.
 
His will struggled with all its might, again and again… At last, he let out a low sigh.
 
“Enough…”
 
His five senses returned, and the ice-cold rushed upon his body. His figure toppled backward as stiffly as an unconscious ice statue, striking the ground with a heavy crash.
 
The entire venue fell into deathly silence.
 
His flesh and blood, his marrow, his profound energy had all been sealed. He could no longer feel pain, could no longer feel the existence of his body—only his consciousness remained, clinging to a final clarity within a frozen void.
 
Yet he did not choose to let that consciousness sink into oblivion. Instead, he parted his stiff, icy lips, and word by word, with utmost clarity, he spoke:
 
“I… admit… defeat.”
 
“…” Shenwu Yi silently put away the Heartless Sword and the Heart-Severing Thorn. The faint trace of blood at the corner of her lips also vanished without a sound.
 
The Chief High Priest’s voice of proclamation followed at once: “Dian Jiuzhi of the Boundless Kingdom of God admits defeat. Shenwu Yi of the Eternal Night Kingdom of God is victorious.”
 
Rumble!
 
Dian Luohou could no longer care about anything else. With an air blast like a clap of thunder, he rushed into the barrier, supporting Dian Jiuzhi, whose entire body was encased in ice crystal. Thick profound energy rolled over him like a slowly surging tide, rapidly dispelling the cold within his body.
 
“Brother Jiuzhi!” Dian Sansi’s face had gone pale. His feet stepped forward again and again, several times nearly unable to resist the impulse to charge in after him.
 
Dian Jiuzhi had lost… He had lost despite an absolute advantage in cultivation, in age, in physical body—a result too many people would never have imagined even in their dreams.
 
The terrifying expression on Dian Luohou’s face further made it clear that Dian Jiuzhi had not only been defeated, but had been far from lightly injured.
 
There were sighs, but not a single note of ridicule.
 
Faced with Shenwu Yi’s Exquisite Profound World and ice crystals that completely transcended common sense and tore through established understanding, Dian Jiuzhi’s defeat, though unexpected, was not unjust.
 
And without a doubt, after this battle, there would no longer be any “Foremost Divine Son” in the Abyss. The title of Eternal Night Divine Daughter would be burned into the memories and souls of everyone present like a brand.
 
“Hahahahaha!! Hahahahahahahaha!!”
 
A hoarse, deranged burst of laughter suddenly rang out, like countless poisoned steel needles viciously stabbing into everyone’s eardrums, so piercing that it made their souls tremble.
 
“This is the so-called Foremost Divine Son? This is the so-called Great Rage God Veins? With the dignified eighth level of the Divine Extinction Realm, yet under the hand of my Eternal Night’s Divine Daughter—who is only at the sixth level of the Divine Extinction Realm—you were defeated like a frozen dead dog. What a colossal joke, hahahahahaha!”
 
No one would mock the Boundless Kingdom of God at such a time, nor would any Divine Regent utter such disgraceful venom… save for the Eternal Night Kingdom of God’s Lightless Divine Regent.
 
That her ridicule was so vicious could be said to be no surprise at all.
 
If it had been any other Divine Regent, they would most likely have chosen restraint, rationally refusing to stoop to the level of a madwoman. But this was, after all, the Boundless Divine Regent, the one with the fiercest temper. Supporting Dian Jiuzhi, Dian Luohou suddenly turned his head, his voice harsh like fire: “Shut up!!”
 
“Hahahahaha!” Shenwu Yanye, however, continued to laugh wildly, each peal more piercing and soul-rending than the last. “What a fine Boundless Divine Son—speaking so sonorously and proudly before, claiming you would concede ten breaths first. I thought you had such incredible ability. Turns out you’re just a piece of trash who collapses at a touch and parades his ugliness before all.
 
“Dian Luohou, having raised such a good-for-nothing who disgraces both his kingdom and self, a laughingstock before the world, what face do you have to shout in front of this Regent!”
 
Bang!!
 
The veins on Dian Luohou’s arms bulged, and his eyes turned ferocious in an instant, as though they might split apart… But this was, in the end, the Pure Land. Gritting his teeth, he forcibly suppressed his fury.
 
The loser must calmly accept the result of being humiliated… He had once taught Dian Jiuzhi this himself.
 
The Boundless Divine Regent’s forbearance did not make the Lightless Divine Regent stop while she was ahead. The pitch-black palanquin in which she sat trembled slightly, and a wisp of profound energy shot out, piercing the barrier. Under the stunned and bewildered gazes of all present, it mercilessly struck Shenwu Yi’s body.
 
With a loud crash, Shenwu Yi was blasted dozens of zhang (meters) away. She did not utter a sound. Upon landing, she dropped to her knees in obeisance. “Wu Yi is useless, and has disappointed mother God.”
 
“…” Yun Che’s gaze turned icy in an instant.
 
“You still know you’re useless!”
 
Shenwu Yanye’s voice was like a wailing specter, making everyone’s soul-strings quake. “To deal with a mere Dian Jiuzhi, an ignorant, arrogant piece of Boundless trash, you actually took this long! And you were even slightly injured! Do you know that even if he were to bleed dry all of his foul, filthy blood, it still wouldn’t be as precious as a single trace of blood on you!”
 
Shenwu Yi lowered her head and replied, “Wu Yi knows her mistake.”
 
Around the palanquin, all the Eternal Night women remained quiet and voiceless, their expressions wholly unchanged, as though they had long since grown used to it.
 
Shock, confusion, incredulity appeared on different faces, and then, without exception, turned into sighs and regret.
 
If Shenwu Yi had appeared in any other Kingdom of God, she would surely have been treasured in every possible way; they would have wished to worship her as a goddess.
 
But of all places, it had to be the Eternal Night Kingdom of God…
 
Her radiance was so dazzling it shocked even the Divine Regents. Yet falling into the hands of this madwoman, Shenwu Yanye, it could only become a tool for her to vent her malice upon the world at will.
 
“You had better know your mistake! In the next battle of the Divine Sons, you must, with your strength alone, rout all the other Divine Sons within ten breaths! Let these men who style themselves noble see just how lowly and pathetic they truly are!”
 
“Yes!” Shenwu Yi answered without the slightest hesitation. “If I fail to do so, I am willing to accept whatever punishment mother God chooses.”
 
The expressions of the various Divine Regents shifted, and the faces belonging to the other five Kingdoms of God all took on varying degrees of ugliness.
 
While scolding and punishing Shenwu Yi, was she not also, at the same time, fiercely humiliating their five Kingdoms of God?
 
And yet, heaven had actually favored this madwoman so greatly, favored the Eternal Night Kingdom of God that stood apart. This generation’s Eternal Night Divine Daughter—her splendor completely overshadowed the former Foremost Divine Son, Dian Jiuzhi, and no doubt completely eclipsed all other God Bearers as well.
 
The Abyssal Monarch stood floating in the air, silently observing all of this. He offered no admonition, spoke not a word. His expression was indifferent as an ancient, frigid peak. Only in his deep eyes did there dwell a subtlety that no one could comprehend.
