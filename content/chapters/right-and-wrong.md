Between heaven and earth, there were few things beyond the knowledge of a Creation God.

However, why the Heaven Smiting Ancestral Sword and the Evil Infant's Wheel of Myriad Tribulations were named "Heaven Smiting" and "Myriad Tribulations" was destined to be unknown to the world, including the Creation Gods and the Devil Emperor. Because the Ancestral God was gone, no one could fathom her heart.

And Mo E's words...

"You... actually... know...?"

Ni Xuan and Mo E had once thought that they were the people who understood each other the best in this world.

Ni Xuan had once said to Mo Su, "Every time that old stubborn mule of yours opens his mouth, I know what kind of creation god fart he's going to let out... Oh right, actually, creation gods also fart. That old stubborn mule of yours farts about six times every one hundred thousand years."

"Hmm... Hmm!? You said Li Suo? Fart! How can a celestial above gods like Li Suo be compared to a rough god like me! Do you believe that I'll throw you into the Life God Hall right now?"

However, he and Mo E had known each other for such a long time, yet he had never heard him mention this matter.

Mo E still used his deathly still words to speak the truth that only he knew in this world: "The Ancestral God was born from nothingness. In the long years, she created profound strength, created rules, created the outline of the world, created the initial appearance of living beings... until the complete concept of creation."

"But to create the world, one must first destroy oneself. The Ancestral God, who was born from nothingness, had no reference for her creation, and it was even more impossible to predict its direction and future. If it was twisted, collapsed, destroyed... she, who had already destroyed herself, was also destined to be unable to interfere and change it."

"Thus, before returning to nothingness, the Ancestral God left behind two... correction devices."

"Correction..."

These were two ordinary words in the mortal world, but when it involved the Ancestral God and the beginning of creation, these two words implicitly caused one's soul to tremble with an invisible unease.

"The first correction device, the Ancestral God bestowed upon it extreme yang energy, bestowed upon it the spirit of a wise and profound elder, and named it — the Heaven Smiting Ancestral Sword."

"The second correction device, the Ancestral God bestowed upon it extreme yin energy, bestowed upon it the purest and cleanest spirit of a child, and named it — the Evil Infant's Wheel of Myriad Tribulations."

The storm in the Primordial Divine Realm stopped, and even space stopped trembling.

The signs of calamity and the sounds of calamity all disappeared.

Between heaven and earth, the sound of a heart beating violently could be heard, its tremors like thunder.

"The mission of the Heaven Smiting Ancestral Sword is to monitor the stability and balance of the world's rules. It is also the 'Heavenly Dao' in the cognition of the world. If the Heavenly Dao is in chaos, the laws will definitely collapse, and the world will be filled with endless calamities until it finally collapses."

"The words 'Heaven Smiting' in the Heaven Smiting Ancestral Sword have never meant 'its might can smite the heavens and destroy the earth' as the world thinks, but rather 'smiting the Heavenly Dao'."

"If the Heavenly Dao is reversed, the Heaven Smiting Ancestral Sword will release its extreme might to annihilate the Heavenly Dao, allowing the world to reshape the Heavenly Dao and the laws, stopping the world from collapsing."

"But... Ni Xuan, you should understand that if the Heavenly Dao is destroyed and the laws collapse, we will be unharmed, but for all the living beings in the world, it will be an endless calamity. When the Heavenly Dao and the laws are reshaped, the world will definitely no longer be the world it once was."

"And in today's world, the greatest maintainers, supporters, and balancers of the Heavenly Dao... are the god race and the devil race." Ni Xuan was stunned for a long time, unable to speak. Only the beating of his heart became increasingly intense.

Mo E continued, "The world has flourished to an endless extent. Over the long years, the Ancestral Sword Spirit has long developed feelings for the world, but these feelings are destined to be unable to override the mission bestowed upon it by the Ancestral God."

He lowered his eyes and looked at the large bronze sword in his hand. His calm gaze and expression were like those of an old friend facing a confidant.

"The Ancestral Sword Spirit is both my teacher and my friend. One day, it told me the reason for its existence and the mission it carried. It told me that even as powerful as the Ancestral God, it was ultimately impossible to predict the development of the world. If the Ancestral God's consciousness still existed, facing such a world, even if the Heavenly Dao was reversed, she would definitely be unwilling to destroy and reshape it."

"When the Ancestral Sword Spirit said these words, it was filled with fear. It was afraid that if one day, the Heavenly Dao was truly reversed, its mission would definitely override its will and unleash the Heaven Smiting Sword."

"Thus, after telling me everything, it chose... to self-destruct."

The sword was his mentor, the sword was his old friend... but they could no longer face each other and speak.

Other than Mo E, no one knew. In the Heaven Smiting Ancestral Sword, there was no longer a sword spirit, only the [Last Ancestral Sword Might] that remained within.

"I once asked it, is there a possibility for the god race and the devil race to coexist peacefully?"

"It told me that the god race and the devil race are like the two ends of a scale. They repel each other, restrain each other, and also balance each other. It has observed countless eras of change. It is precisely because of the mutual hostility and balance of these two heavenly giants that they can each form alliances for a long time, cooperate with each other against external threats, and eliminate internal strife."

"If the two races merge, it would be equivalent to the two races that support the world both losing their only restraint."

"What will be derived from this cannot be predicted. But... it is undeniable that there is a possibility that the balance will be broken and the Heavenly Dao will be reversed. Moreover, this possibility is too great."

"So great that the Ancestral Sword Spirit could not accept it."

"Therefore, before it chose to self-destruct, it had only one request... It wanted me to swear that as long as I exist, I would never break the balance between the god race and the devil race. As long as this foundation exists, the Heavenly Dao can never be in chaos."

Bang!

Ni Xuan's half-supporting knee heavily knelt down.

"How could I not agree to this oath, and how could I not do it?" Mo E murmured, "Because the words 'Heaven Smiting' are its sword name, and also my divine name."

"My mission, from the day I was created, was firmly engraved into my divine soul, my bones, and my blood."

A desolate wind suddenly rose, this time carrying every strand of the Heaven Smiting God Emperor's messy hair.

"But why is it my only close friend, why is it my most beloved son?"

His voice still did not carry a trace of sorrow.

Because extreme pain has no sorrow, extreme sorrow has no tears.

"And it just had to be me... the only two people in this world who cannot stop it."

He softly murmured, "Your divine soul is engraved with rebellion. If I forcefully stop you, it will only further stimulate your rebellious soul. Only by banishing the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor can this connection be eternally severed."

"Mo Su's temperament seems soft and cowardly, but in his bones, he is deeply engraved with an extremely terrifying stubbornness. He will do anything for what he believes in, regardless of the consequences, and there is no possibility of stopping him. I could only personally execute him."

He hated himself, and he also hated Ni Xuan: "Back then, I let him follow you for a thousand years. Refining the Heaven Breaker Sword was secondary. Using your carefree nature to resolve his stubbornness was the main reason... That was actually the biggest mistake of my life."

Ni Xuan's five fingers deeply sank into the blood-stained earth. There were countless wounds on his body, but he could not feel a trace of pain.

Those divine eyes that were originally always filled with smiles and unrestrainedness were now filled with a desolate blankness.

The mission of the Heaven Smiting Ancestral Sword and the Evil Infant's Wheel of Myriad Tribulations was undoubtedly the most terrifying truth in this world.

And Mo E was the only one who knew. For countless years, he had borne it alone and never told anyone... because even a Creation God, knowing this truth, would be suppressed for a lifetime, unable to breathe.

No wonder, as the number one Creation God, he had always adhered to his own path throughout his life, never overstepping his bounds, almost... cautiously.

Finally, Ni Xuan's voice was even drier than before: "Tell me, if the mission of the Heaven Smiting Ancestral Sword is to reshape the Heavenly Dao, then what is the mission of the Evil Infant's Wheel of Myriad Tribulations?"

Mo E spoke, just five words: "Purification of the human dao."

"..." Ni Xuan's blood flow suddenly stopped.

"The 'evil' spirit lies between good and evil, not leaning towards either side. With a child as its initial spirit, pure and clean, it can thus directly receive and perceive the good or evil from the world."

"If she receives mostly love and kindness from the world, she will be attached to the world, protect the world, and become a wheel that protects the world."

"Conversely, if she receives mostly evil and malice from the world, then the world in her eyes will be a world of filth and evil, and she will thus bring down 'myriad tribulations' to cleanse the turbid souls of the world."

Mo E said woodenly, "By the time I learned all of this from the Ancestral Sword Spirit, the devil race had already done the most wrong and foolish thing."

"The 'Evil Infant's' uncontrollable childish temperament, coupled with her terrifying power, caused her to unintentionally create disasters many times. If she could be given long-term tolerance, guidance, and care, she would gradually integrate into the devil race and become a wheel that protects the world."

"But, a power that surpassed the Devil Emperor and was uncontrollable caused the devil race to be extremely wary. In the end, they chose to use her childishness, lure her into a formation, coax her to sleep, and then gather the power of all the Devil Emperors and Devil Gods to seal her eternally."

"That had better be a truly eternal seal. Otherwise, if she breaks free from the seal, her hatred and malice, even I cannot imagine what kind of terrifying 'myriad tribulations' it will trigger."

The Heaven Smiting Ancestral Sword slowly lowered, making a light thud as it hit the ground.

Mo E turned around, his back as desolate as the gray sky of the primordial era: "Ni Xuan, our battle today determines the fate of your daughter, and she is the anomaly derived from the union of a Creation God and the Devil Emperor. Therefore, no matter what, I must win, even if it is not an honorable victory."

He slowly took a step, the heavy sword leaving a gradually extending mark on the primordial earth.

His voice also heavily echoed in this colorless primordial world.

"What kind of fruit today's cause will bring, I am destined to be unable to see. But at least, while I am alive, the union of gods and devils is blocked."

"I, Heaven Smiting God Emperor Mo E, have failed Mo Su, failed myself, failed you... But at least, I have not failed the name 'Heaven Smiting God Emperor', have not violated my oath to the Ancestral Sword Spirit, and have not辜负 the destiny bestowed upon me by the Ancestral God."

"Wait." Ni Xuan spoke, looking at Mo E's distant back: "You still owe me... a bet!"

Mo E's footsteps stopped, and the entire world seemed to freeze.

Finally, the frozen world moved. Mo E raised his hand, space cracked, and a pale golden barrier flew out from within, landing beside Ni Xuan.

Creation God power flowed on the barrier, and a faint figure of a young girl could be vaguely discerned within.

"She can live. But all traces of devil must be erased... This is my last concession."

Ni Xuan tremblingly reached out and touched the barrier in front of him, tears streaming from his eyes.

Suddenly, he sensed something and roared in a low voice: "You just said... 'destined to be unable to see', what did you mean?"

Mo E did not stop, his voice like a faint smoke: "Just now, it was not the second time I used the Ancestral Sword Might."

"It was the third time."

Ni Xuan: "!?"

"Banishing the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor and her devil race was the second time."

"The first time..." Although he was already emotionally numb, his voice still paused for a moment: "Was executing Mo Su."

"Pan Ming's daughter, in order to save Mo Su, used the Pan Ming Void Breaker Mirror to travel through the Primordial Divine Realm and appear beside Mo Su. I was prepared for this, but I never expected that she would also carry the Nirvana Devil Reverse Wheel Pearl."

"Two supreme devil artifacts, a double seal of space and time, I could not break free with my power. Just as Mo Su was about to be taken away by Pan Ming's daughter, I had no choice but to use the Heaven Smiting Ancestral Sword."

Ni Xuan's arm weakly fell, and he slowly closed his eyes.

Three uses of the Ancestral Sword... ninety percent of his lifespan was depleted.

"As spirits created by the Ancestral God, I destroyed the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor and her race. My sin is unforgivable. I will repay it with my life, and the Heaven Smiting lineage will also be eternally severed."

"Because of my own stubbornness, I personally killed my son. I am not worthy of being a father, not worthy of being a god, not worthy of being a human, not worthy of living in this world."

He looked back and deeply looked at Ni Xuan one last time: "After this farewell, there will be no time to meet again. Take care, my only close friend."

He took a step, and a cold wind suddenly rose, carrying strands of snow-white in his long hair.

In the gray world, only Ni Xuan's figure remained.

......

......

......

......

He raised his hand and tightly grasped his face. The bones in his five fingers shattered inch by inch, but he still could not suppress the sobbing that continuously overflowed.

Life God Hall.

He had once promised Jie Yuan that he would never see the Life Creation God Li Suo again, and never approach the Life God Hall.

He broke his promise.

However, in the memory fragments, Li Suo was a blurry shadow, and it was impossible to see her celestial appearance that had overwhelmed the god and devil era.

Perhaps, he deliberately blurred his vision when looking at Li Suo, in order to keep the promise of "not seeing" Li Suo to the greatest extent.

"... Ni... Xuan?"

If not for the aura unique to the Creation God of Elements, Li Suo could not believe that this dirty, tattered, and disheveled person was actually Ni Xuan.

He always cared about his appearance, even the direction of each strand of hair would be quietly controlled.

Ni Xuan did not respond to her. He slowly walked forward, each step so stiff and heavy.

The "ice coffin" in his hand was gently placed on the ground. Inside, a sleeping young girl lay quietly, like an exquisite porcelain doll.

Yun Che recognized at a glance that it was Hong'er.

"The Eternal Hub..." Li Suo softly said, "She is?"

"My... daughter..." The opening and closing of Ni Xuan's lips were so difficult, and his voice was even drier, like metal scraping.

Li Suo was silent for a long time.

"I... reshaped her incomplete soul, but I cannot make her soul perfectly compatible. Especially that... sword soul that must exist..."

Because her mother... the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor had a sword soul. It was destined that one of her soul foundations was also a sword soul.

"Li Suo, only you can do it."

"... I understand." Li Suo did not ask further and slightly nodded.

"... Thank... you..."

He softly said two words, staring fixedly at the young girl in the Eternal Hub for a while, then turned around and walked out woodenly.

"Ni Xuan!" Li Suo called out to him, "What... happened to you?"

Ni Xuan's voice, which did not belong to the Creation God of Elements, said, "I made... a big mistake..."

"So what if you made a mistake?" Li Suo softly said, "You once said with a smile that there is no living being in the world who does not make mistakes. As long as the heart is not evil, there is no need to be bound by mistakes, but to do one's best to correct and make up for them, to learn from mistakes and correct them."

Ni Xuan murmured, "That is because... some mistakes can be forgiven, and some mistakes cannot be forgiven."

Li Suo was stunned for a moment, then consoled, "Whether in the God Realm or the Lower Realms, you have always been the most respected Creation God by all living beings. The races that have received your great kindness are countless."

"The kindness you have bestowed upon the world makes them willing to praise you for ten thousand generations."

"Crea... tion... God..."

He softly said these three words that were once so familiar, but there was no color in his eyes: "I am no longer worthy of being a Creation God, and this world no longer has... a Creation God of Elements..."

Li Suo: "..."

Ni Xuan looked ahead, his eyes empty: "I have caused a great disaster, I am not worthy of being righteous, I have never... been trapped in evil, if I am still worthy of a divine name, then call it..."

"Evil... God..."

From his body, the Life Creation God felt extreme grayness, extreme regret, extreme hatred... hatred for himself.

Ni Xuan's heavy footsteps suddenly stopped.

"Li Suo..." He asked, "Is there... a place suitable for a peaceful sleep, undisturbed by anyone?"

Tired.

Every word he spoke was so hoarse and tired.

Separated by dimensions and years, even Yun Che could clearly discern Ni Xuan's pain and avoidance of reality and fate.

Li Suo's feelings were undoubtedly a thousand times stronger than Yun Che's. She did not dissuade him, but only softly said, "In the Southern Region, at the bottom of the Heavenly Netherworld Tower... How long do you want to sleep?"

Ni Xuan said, "I don't know. Perhaps a million years, perhaps ten million years... until my consciousness is willing to wake up, or never wake up."

Li Suo: "..."

"My daughter, I entrust her to you. Find a suitable identity and home for her. Do not tell her about her origins. I only wish for her to live a carefree life and enjoy peace."

"But this kindness is difficult to repay."

He turned his head, the corners of his lips slightly twitching... He was trying to smile, to express gratitude, and to make a decent farewell.

But, after countless years, he who had always been joyful, could no longer smile... as if he had forgotten how to smile.
