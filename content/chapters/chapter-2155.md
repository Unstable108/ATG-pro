Yun Che, Mo Su… At this moment, Mo Su knew that anyone else facing the Abyss Emperor would have been terrified into kneeling, their heads bowed and souls trembling uncontrollably. But the Yun Che in his line of sight showed not a hint of terror or panic. He simply met his gaze directly, his eyes possessing a calm and depth that no petitioner had ever displayed before.

“If I may ask,” he began. He neither answered nor argued. Instead, he posed a counter-question to the most supreme existence in all of heaven and earth: “If it were you, would you be willing to stop at nothing for the one you love, even in the face of insurmountable obstacles?”

The air grew still. Space froze. Even their gazes seemed locked by an invisible force.

After a moment, the divine light in the Abyss Emperor’s eyes intensified. That divine pressure, unique to the Abyss Emperor and powerful enough to make the heavens tremble and all living things prostrate themselves, crashed down upon Yun Che. “A mere child. What right do you have to question Us¹?”

It was like the sky collapsing upon him. His bones felt as if they would shatter, his soul as if it would snap. Yet Yun Che’s eyes remained clear, his sea of consciousness lucid. He continued to look directly into the Abyss Emperor’s eyes, without shock, without fear, without reverence—only with that persistent, mysteriously subtle depth. It was a gaze of equality, one the Abyss Emperor had not faced in millions of years.

Yun Che spoke, his expression and tone tinged with an inscrutable haze. “I am not asking the Abyss Emperor, but rather…”

“Mo Su.”

The air, space, and their gazes froze once more. This time, however, it was not followed by the overwhelming divine pressure of a boundless sea. The stillness was profound and protracted, as if time itself had silently stopped. After an unknown amount of time, the frozen world seemed to stir back to life, yet it was as if time was flowing in reverse, traveling back to a long-vanished ancient era within their still-locked gazes.

“I would…”

His voice, his answer, seemed to come from an impossibly distant time and space. “I only fear… I would not even have the chance to stop at nothing.”

He referred to himself as “I,” not “Us.”

A faint smile touched Yun Che’s lips. He had his answer, for the one standing before him was no longer purely the supreme Abyss Emperor, but the man who had “remembered” his former identity, his former name—Mo Su.

Yun Che had already considered and rehearsed the perfect posture and words to use when facing the Abyss Emperor countless times. But the final memory fragment from the Heretic God, Ni Xuan, was only revealed to him upon arriving in the Pure Land, causing all his previous efforts to collapse. It was at that moment he understood with absolute clarity that when he faced the Abyss Emperor alone, there was only one stance he needed to—and could—present.

Equality! There was no other choice.

However, already in the Pure Land and destined to face the Abyss Emperor alone at any moment, he had no time to devise and practice how to perfectly present this stance of equality. Thus, in that extremely short window, he could only apply layer after layer of mental suggestion to himself… I possess the Heretic God’s profound veins. I am Ni Xuan’s successor… Therefore, I am Ni Xuan! I am the Heretic God! In Ni Xuan’s eyes, in my eyes, the Mo Su of the past was a child filled with bewilderment… and the Mo Su of today, stripped of his Abyss Emperor mantle, is he not filled with an even deeper, darker bewilderment in his heart? And so, for today’s “reunion,” I am joyful, I meet his gaze as an equal, I sigh with emotion, I am concerned… He then condensed all these complex emotions, too difficult to put into words, into the look he directed at him.

“As I expected. If it were you, that would be your answer.” In Yun Che’s eyes, the Abyss Emperor had already given his answer long ago.

If not for the Punishment of Desolate Gnawing that the Abyss Emperor had specifically bestowed, the obstacles before him and Cai Li would not have been cleared away so easily, even transforming the world’s disdain into reverence. He had wanted to witness for himself the depth of Yun Che’s devotion to Hua Caili, to judge whether he was worthy of becoming “his” successor.

Yun Che’s voice gradually softened, laced with an irrepressible emotion. “Mo Su, I have finally found you… carrying my master’s sole final wish.”

The Abyss Emperor’s expression remained as eternally placid as it had been for ages, but no one could know that every word Yun Che spoke tugged at his emotions, stirring waves in his sea of consciousness. And no one could possibly imagine the tremendous impact Yun Che’s final words had on his soul, causing a clear crack to appear in his eternal indifference as the Abyss Emperor.

“Your master… where is he now?” A momentary tremor laced the gaps between his words.

Yun Che’s smile faded as he lowered his voice. “Five years ago, Master… passed into eternity.”

Mo Su turned to the side and slowly looked up. After a moment, he asked again, “Where has your master been all these years? And when did he arrive?”

“The Sea of Fog.” Yun Che answered, then sighed softly. “And it was not until the day he passed that he told me he had remained in the Sea of Fog for… six hundred and seventy thousand years.”

At that moment, the Abyss Emperor—no, at this moment, he was Mo Su—who would not flinch even if the heavens collapsed, felt his body tremble ever so slightly, as if this number had shattered a facade maintained for millions of years.

“So… it really was him… It really was him…” he murmured, staring into the distance. His composure gradually faded, his voice tinged with sorrow.

“I should have known… I should have known…”

“Six hundred and seventy thousand years.” This number was not a rough fabrication by Yun Che based on when the Heretic God fell. It came from the elemental seed of the Qilin God; the soul remnant upon it clearly stated it had fallen into the world of the Abyss six hundred and seventy thousand years ago. And as expected, this timeframe stirred the Abyss Emperor’s emotions profoundly.

His mind was a whirlwind of thoughts as he spoke, lost in a daze. “Six hundred and seventy thousand years ago, I happened to sense his aura. I was ecstatic, but when I found the source, it was merely one of his elemental seeds, which had already been swallowed by a Qilin God and fused with its soul crystal.”

“I tried searching for several hundred years but found no other trace of his aura. So, I brought that Qilin God to my side to soothe my longing… It later committed a grave error, but because it carried his aura, I could not bear to kill it and chose to exile it instead.”

“I thought it was just one of his elemental seeds that had fallen into the Abyssal World for some reason. But it turns out, it really was him… It really was him… I never knew. How could I have given up the search so soon?”

Yun Che said softly, “Because Master did not want to be found by you. His only choice was to remain hidden in the Sea of Fog.”

“Why…?” he asked.

Yun Che gazed at Mo Su’s profile, his voice tinged with a deep pain. “Master said… he was too ashamed to face you.”

“Heh…” Mo Su was speechless for a moment, then slowly shook his head. He looked into the void, his strained voice seeming to traverse space and time. “Elder Brother Ni Xuan², why must you be like this? I have never blamed you, nor could I ever blame you. Even with today’s consequences, being close to you, becoming your sworn brother, remains the greatest fortune of my life.”

Yun Che secretly calmed his slightly frantic heartbeat and continued his soft narration. “Master told me that after settling all his affairs in the other world, he chose to fall into the Abyss of Nothingness to atone for his sins and to be your companion. He never imagined that the world below the Abyss had become a new realm, and that you were still alive, known as the Abyss Emperor.”

“Master said he yearned for a reunion with you, but he had too many reasons not to see you. Besides his profound guilt, he could not allow himself to interfere in your life again, to disrupt the path you had already set… regardless of whether your choices were right or wrong, regardless of where that path led.”

Mo Su remained dazed, staring ahead, his voice endlessly distant. “Elder Brother Ni Xuan, you were always such a… free and unrestrained person…”

Yun Che’s voice immediately followed. “Master said he was once the most free and unrestrained person in the world. But on the matter concerning you, he made a mistake—an unforgivable one. If he had chosen to stop you back then, instead of indulging and encouraging you, you would not have been executed in the Abyss of Nothingness by your own Father God, and you would not be trapped in this abyss of suffering today.”

These words indicated that his “master” had told him much about the events of the past.

“It was also because of this great mistake that your Father God’s life ended prematurely, and a vicious war erupted between the God Race and the Devil Race, leading to the end of that era… That is why Master said he was no longer worthy of the title ‘Creation God.’ He renamed himself the ‘Heretic God’ and secluded himself from the world, spending the rest of his life imprisoned by guilt and pain, until the day he passed.”

Mo Su slowly turned back to face Yun Che. His gaze had also subtly changed, no longer the condescending look that had been ingrained in him for millions of years, almost becoming instinct.

“He… told you a great deal.”

“Yes. And he bestowed a great deal upon me as well.” Yun Che raised his hand. With a flick of his fingers, fire, frost, lightning, and wind swirled in his palm in succession. “Master granted me his profound veins, allowing me to be attuned to various elemental profound energies. He also gave me the power of Phoenix flames, Golden Crow flames, and the Ice Phoenix… To strengthen my body, he gave me the Dragon God’s blood and marrow.”

This was Ni Xuan, the former Creation God of Elements. For him, these ancient divine legacies, non-existent in the Abyss, were all perfectly reasonable.

He closed his fingers, and a withered yellow light—the light of the Qilin—shone in his palm. “Before Master passed, he guided me to find the lost elemental seed, making my originally incomplete profound veins whole again.”

“No wonder that secret realm collapsed so abnormally,” Mo Su murmured. “So, it was because it saw his successor and returned to him with endless joy.”

Yun Che changed his hand gesture again, and the phantom of a pagoda radiating a faint golden light appeared in his palm. “This is the Great Way of the Buddha Art, which Master taught me to temper my body. When I had achieved some mastery, Master told me that this divine art was created by you.”

“No,” Mo Su said, denying it to Yun Che’s surprise. “Half by me, half by him.”

Yun Che: “...?”

He looked at Yun Che, his eyes filled with reminiscence. “Back then, I traveled the many worlds with him, witnessing the myriad beings of the great chiliocosm, seeing true good and evil. One day, I had an epiphany beneath a pagoda in a mortal world.”

“And it was he who helped me comprehend that epiphany, who guided me to understand the karma of mortal life and the great dao of heaven and earth… Even the general formula of the Great Way of the Buddha Art was laid by him, which led to the subsequent twelve stages of the Buddha.”

This was something Yun Che truly did not know. He had originally thought that since the Great Way of the Buddha Art could be passed down from the ancient past to the present day, it wouldn't be too out of place for the Heretic God to know of it. He never expected it to be a joint creation of Ni Xuan and Mo Su. However, Ni Xuan, possessing the body of a Creation God, had no need to cultivate it; his involvement was solely for Mo Su’s sake.

“I see.” Yun Che nodded with genuine emotion—this time, it was not feigned. When truths from a known domain are mixed with lies from an unknown one, the lies become truth as well. Every word that left Yun Che’s mouth was undoubtedly a dance on a razor’s edge.

“Did he ask you to find me?” Mo Su asked.

“No,” Yun Che shook his head without hesitation. “Although Master saved my life, took me as his disciple, and gave me everything I have today, he taught me more than once that my life belongs only to me. I should follow my heart, be unrestrained by the world, and not be bound or swayed by the will of any other.”

“If I were to meet you, it would be the guidance of fate. If we did not meet, there was no need to force it. His only final wish was that if I did meet you, I should tell you everything without reservation… In doing so, it might perhaps ease your loneliness a little.”

“I never expected that my origin would be the Dream Weaver God Kingdom, one of the Six God Kingdoms. And because of this origin, I met you so quickly. Perhaps this, too, is a form of guidance from heaven’s will, allowing me to fulfill Master’s final wish sooner.”

“But speaking of which…” In the presence of the Abyss Emperor who looked down upon the world, Yun Che actually crossed his arms, his gaze holding a teasing and half-joking indignation. “Our meeting, in the end, was orchestrated by you.”

“Oh?” Mo Su showed his confusion.

“Alas,” Yun Che sighed dramatically. “A hundred years ago, the reason I vanished from the core of the Dream Weaver God Kingdom’s divine domain, despite being under heavy protection, with no trace of me alive or dead, was all thanks to the ‘Void-Breaking Divine Jade’ you bestowed upon the Dream Weaver God Kingdom.”

Mo Su: “…”

“That Void-Breaking Divine Jade teleported me to the depths of the Sea of Fog without a trace. If I hadn’t met Master, I would have been eroded by the Abyss until not even dust remained. So…” He tilted his head and laughed irreverently. “This thing called fate… is truly marvelous, isn’t it?”

For countless years in the Abyss, no one had ever shown such an attitude before the Abyss Emperor, nor had anyone ever made him feel an emotion other than “sorrow” so clearly. The man in his sight—his expression, his eyes, the way he spoke… became more and more like the Elder Brother Ni Xuan in his memory, the images overlapping, stirring a quiet yet deepening thrum in his heart.

He spoke, suddenly murmuring Yun Che’s name. “Yun Che… ‘Intent as faint as a cloud, soul as clear as water.’ Indeed, a name he would give.”

“Yun Che.” He called his name again, followed by a statement that would shake the heavens. “Are you willing… to become sworn brothers³ with me?”

“...!!” Yun Che’s heart leaped, and words of panic almost instinctively rose in his throat.

But in the next instant, he lowered his arms, his eyes shining brightly. A smile bloomed on his face as he declared loudly, “Alright!”

Mo Su was stunned.

Then, he began to laugh. “Hahahaha, hahahahaha!”

His laughter was followed by an even more unrestrained peal. In the world’s perception, the Abyss Emperor was nearly emotionless; the rare, faint smile never betrayed the slightest fluctuation of feeling. Neither the Abyssal Knights nor the God Venerables had ever seen the Abyss Emperor like this.

“As expected of Elder Brother Ni Xuan’s successor! Truly Elder Brother Ni Xuan’s successor, hahaha!”

“Anyone else would have been terrified, flustered, and overwhelmed. They would care about status, seniority, race, and rank. Only Elder Brother Ni Xuan… only Elder Brother Ni Xuan’s successor…”

He didn’t know how many years it had been since he could so freely express his joy and sorrow before another person. His vision blurred unknowingly, as if he were once again seeing that scene from long ago, hearing that voice from the past…

“My first lesson is this… you don’t need to acknowledge me as your master, and don’t call me ‘Senior’ anymore. Just call me Elder Brother.”

“Wh-… Ah? No, no… I can’t, I absolutely cannot!”

“What? This is the very first thing, and you’re already disobeying me?”

“No, I wouldn’t dare. But there is an order between the old and young, a distinction between the honored and the humble. You are the senior I respect most. How could I address you with such a disrespectful title?”

“Aiya, what’s all this about seniority and status? If you’re unwilling to cast off even the shackle of ‘seniority,’ then even if you are by my side, how is that any different from before? You should go. You don’t need to follow me anymore.”

“E… Elder Brother…”

“That’s more like it! From today on, you and I will travel the world together as brothers. We can talk about anything, unrestrained and joyous! All that ‘senior’ and ‘master’ stuff… it’s utterly dull just thinking about it.”

…At that moment, the Yun Che in Mo Su’s eyes truly, completely bore the shadow of Ni Xuan.
