The gentle breeze atop Eden's Cloud Top grew colder, becoming bone-chilling. So much frothy blood gathered into a stream, dripping in thick rivulets from the corners of Yun Che's lips. No one knew—or perhaps no one dared to imagine—that the spiritual torment Yun Che endured surpassed even that of his body.

It was as if endless, violent, resentful spirits were roaring and crashing within his soul sea, their sharp claws cruelly tearing at his soul amidst piercing shrieks, their fires of resentment searing his will and conviction. Such a spiritual ordeal, if inflicted upon an ordinary Divine Master, would be enough to cause a complete collapse in a single breath¹... let alone when compounded by physical torture, let alone for two hundred full breaths.

"Yun Che, focus and listen to my voice! You must hold on to your clarity! Yun Che!!" Li Suo's voice was more frantic than ever. Like Meng Kongchan in the world outside, she called out ceaselessly, using the only means she had to pull back Yun Che's soul, which was like a lone boat in a raging sea.

Amidst her panicked cries, a distorted, hoarse roar echoed from his soul sea: "Silence... How could I be... as fragile as you think!"

Li Suo's voice gradually faded.

Yet, within the turbulent, near-shattering soul sea, Yun Che's voice continued to resound: "How can this pain compare to the sorrow of the Blue Pole Star's fall, to the ashes of ten thousand hopes..."

"How can this pain compare to the calamity of my homeland on the brink of ruin, to the demise of all its souls..."

"How can this pain compare to the weight of the destiny I bear..."

"I am... Emperor Yun of the God Realm! I came here to overturn the Abyss, and I bear the safety of every soul in my homeland on my shoulders... This mere Punishment of Desolation Devouring... this trivial pain of body and soul... is it worthy of making me collapse... worthy of making me yield!?"

"What... a... joke!!"

After a long while, Li Suo's voice sounded again... gone was the earlier urgency and panic, replaced by a tone even softer and gentler than usual. "Very well. I will watch you quietly as you safely pass through this... minor setback on your abyssal path."

Fifty breaths... sixty breaths... seventy breaths... Time crawled by with terrifying slowness. Everyone could hear the distinct beat of their own heart... yet not once did they hear even a single, fleeting cry of pain from Yun Che.

The bones in all ten of Yun Che's fingers were completely exposed, and deep, bloody holes had been pierced through his palms, staining them crimson. Even the mist of sweat rising from his body had turned into a shocking blood mist. The Punishment of Desolation Devouring, according to records, was an ultimate torture that ravaged one's very "existence." Any part of one's body and soul, no matter how small, would suffer the cruelest desolation. The muscles all over his body writhed and undulated madly, and his veins bulged like dying, struggling flood dragons... but his tightly pressed lips never uttered a single sound of submission. No matter how his body trembled in agony, his spine remained proudly erect.

He was like a winter pine that could not be burned away or crushed in the searing flames of purgatory.

Eighty breaths... ninety breaths... Meng Kongchan had stopped calling out. He stared blankly at Yun Che, letting the tears of a Divine Master well up in his eyes again and again.

Such will, such pride... this was his, Meng Kongchan's, son!

A faint shadow flickered before Hua Qingying's eyes. She subconsciously reached up to touch it... it was a strand of her own black hair, which she had torn out without realizing it.

Hua Caili's body had not stopped trembling for a moment, and countless cracks had spread across her heart... But as if hearing her choked sobs, Yun Che, under the stunned gazes of all present, slowly opened his eyes.

His gaze met Hua Caili's in a silent touch. At this moment, the whites of his eyes were filled with terrifying blood vessels, the veins on his temples throbbed wildly, and his features contorted in violent spasms with every passing instant... He looked more horrifying than the most ferocious of demons.

But in Hua Caili's eyes, even if all the grace and splendor of every man in the world were gathered before her, it could not compare to this single moment from Yun Che.

"Cai... Li..."

His lips trembled, yet he managed to form a sound—extremely dry and hoarse, but clear enough to be heard.

"Don't... be afraid..."

"It doesn't... hurt... at all..."

He actually smiled... The curve of his lips was stained with blood from his broken teeth, mixing with saliva and bloody froth as it trickled down. It was a ferocious and terrifying sight, yet his eyes held a gentleness that made Hua Caili's heart and soul tremble.

Meeting his gaze, Hua Caili also began to smile softly... but in the same instant, tears streamed down her face like rain.

"Brother Yun, look at me... listen to my voice..."

Hua Caili gazed into his blood-red eyes, her tearful voice echoing across Eden's Cloud Top, in the ears and souls of everyone present. "Today's pain is one you selfishly bear for me... I will... train hard... I will quickly become as strong as Aunt² and Father God³. After today... all the hardships... obstacles... and pain... I will bear them all!"

These were not the sweet nothings of a young girl whispered in private, but a resolute oath made upon this most sacred ground, before Yun Che, and in the presence of the Abyssal Monarch and the Six God Kingdoms. With heaven and earth as witness, and the people of the world as proof, it was a vow that could not be broken.

Yun Che, enduring the punishment alone; Hua Caili, softly reciting her oath... At this moment, everyone present was deeply moved.

They should have been mocking Yun Che and Hua Caili for their audacity, scorning them for their shamelessness in abandoning a betrothal to "fall for" another, and sighing over Yun Che's world-shocking talent being wasted on a path to ruin... But now, they couldn't help but feel... that perhaps the Abyssal Monarch's bestowed marriage was truly a mistake.

Yun Che, who had defeated a God-Annihilating foe with the power of a Divine Master, was nothing short of astonishing. Hua Caili's talent in the way of the sword was enough to shake the ages, earning even the Abyssal Monarch's praise. They were the only two with perfect godhood in the current era, the first time twin stars had descended upon the Abyss in its history, and both were descendants of Divine Masters... Everything about them seemed like a match made in heaven⁴.

The Abyssal Monarch watched in silence. He had not spoken a word since the Punishment of Desolation Devouring began, and the faint divine radiance surrounding him seemed to have frozen time itself. No one knew that his vision, at this moment, was covered in a thick, blurry haze.

One hundred and ten breaths... one hundred and twenty breaths...

On the side of the Senluo God Kingdom, Dian Luohou's brow was deeply furrowed. He had been silent for a long time... and had not once laughed, cursed, or mocked Yun Che to hit a man when he's down⁵. There was only a profound gravity about him.

Dian Jiuzhi's expression had been constantly shifting—pity, shock, bewilderment... But now, hearing Hua Caili's soul-touching whisper, the corner of his mouth twitched, and he gave a faint smile.

Someone is willing to do this for you... and you have found someone for whom you are willing to do this... Caili, congratulations on finding the best person for you. I am genuinely happy for you... and for myself. My waiting and protection are no longer needed for the rest of your life. What I can still do is gradually quell my father's anger and shield you from the storms that lie beyond your happiness.

Beside him, Dian Sansi stood frozen, his earlier madness and glee long gone, replaced by an ever-deepening sense of confusion.

In the distant sky, a red figure had appeared at some unknown time, gazing at the scene on Eden's Cloud Top. She wore a long, fiery robe, and her snow-white hair was unbound. Powerful cultivators were supposed to be immune to the erosion of time, yet time seemed to have poured all its cruelty upon her, leaving her face as wrinkled as withered wood. In her sunken sockets, a pair of eyes that in her youth could have captivated countless souls were now nothing but a dull, gray turbidity.

"To think such a will, and such a devoted man, exists in this world... Cough... cough cough!" She coughed violently, unable to stop for a long time.

The attendant Sushang, standing quietly by her side, reached out and gently patted her back. "Master, the lingering affliction in your body has not yet cleared. Since you have seen what you came to see, it is time to go back."

"Alright." She did not resist. Her final gaze fell upon the Abyssal Monarch, lingering on him for a long while.

"He... must be deeply moved by this scene." Sushang supported the red-robed woman as they departed in silence, as if they had never been there at all.

At this moment, a strange quiet fell over Eden's Cloud Top, broken only by the sound of Yun Che's blood and sweat dripping to the ground.

All eyes were fixed on Yun Che, silently counting the passage of time.

One hundred and sixty breaths... one hundred and seventy breaths...

"To have such a son, what more could one ask for in this life," Qi Heng Divine Master murmured.

Beside him, Pan Buzhuo had lost all trace of his earlier sneer. The gaze he now cast upon Yun Che reflected a sense of humility he had never felt before. All his previous malice, harsh words... and even jealousy, now made him seem pathetic and laughable.

One hundred and eighty breaths... one hundred and ninety breaths!

Suddenly, a shrill scream pierced the air.

"Absurd! Absurd!! Men are the most hypocritical and wretched things in this world! How could any man do this for a woman... It's fake... just a filthy act, a hypocritical lie! Fake... It's all fake!!"

The Wuming Divine Master, who had been quiet for so long, shrieked as if she had suddenly gone mad. Her black palanquin⁶ was torn apart by the uncontrolled power in her voice, the dark curtains fluttering wildly. A series of pained cries followed as most of the Daughters of Eternal Night around the palanquin were thrown to the ground, clutching their ears in agony.

"No... How could such a man exist in this world! Impossible... Impossible! It's all a hypocritical lie... Hypocrisy... Lies... LIES! Ahahahahaha!!"

Bang!

The shattered palanquin suddenly shot into the sky, carrying the emotionally shattered Shenwu Yanye away from Eden's Cloud Top, disappearing to an unknown destination.

"Divine Master!" Shenwu Youluan cried out in alarm. She quickly grabbed Shenwu Yi's wrist and led the others in hurried pursuit. In the instant before she leaped off Eden's Cloud Top, Shenwu Yi inexplicably glanced back... Her final gaze, as if guided by an unseen force, fell upon Yun Che. A complex, unreadable emotion flickered in her eyes before she vanished into the clouds.

Two hundred breaths!

The High Priest abruptly withdrew his hands, and thousands of withered-yellow profound lights flew away from Yun Che's body... but his divine eyes remained fixed on Yun Che, a great wave, the likes of which he had not felt in a million years, surging through his heart. He asked himself if he could have endured such a punishment from start to finish without a single sound, as Yun Che had. He could not.

What kind of will, what kind of conviction...

"Yuan'er!!"

"Brother Yuan!"

"God Child Yuan!!!"

"Brother Yun!"

...

The pain receded like a tide, replaced by a cacophony of shouts, each more urgent than the last. Yun Che's spirit relaxed, and his upper body, which had remained proudly erect throughout the Punishment of Desolation Devouring, lost all feeling. He fell backward limply and landed in a gentle embrace.

Meng Kongchan gently held his body, his robes instantly stained with blood... This Wumeng Divine Master, who had led the Dreamweaver God Kingdom for ten thousand years, was at a complete loss. His hands, which could shatter heavens and sunder mountains, now dared not exert the slightest force. He simply knelt there woodenly, not daring to move for a long time.

Amidst the shouts, Yun Che opened his eyes, but it was a long while before his vision could capture even a few blurry images.

He grinned, revealing a seemingly triumphant smile. "See... the Punishment of Desolation Devouring... is nothing... special..."

Hua Caili buried her face in his chest, sobbing uncontrollably. Her clenched fists wanted to strike him hard, but she could never bring herself to let them fall.

Hua Qingying turned her gaze back to Hua Fuchen and said, "Well? The man Caili chose for herself is far better than the one you picked for her, isn't he?"

Hua Fuchen smiled. "This boy... he just makes one worry too much."

As he spoke, the smile on his lips did not fade.

No one knew that the Abyssal Monarch, who had remained calm and unperturbed throughout, had only just now had his vision return to focus.

He turned his back and said coolly, "Since the punishment has been endured, the engagement between Hua Caili and Dian Jiuzhi is hereby annulled."

Yun Che laboriously turned his head to face the Abyssal Monarch. "Thank... you... Abyssal Monarch... for your... grace..."

With his last word spoken, he could hold on no longer, and his consciousness sank completely into darkness.

Dian Luohou suddenly spun around and let out a sharp roar: "Let's go!"

No one from the Senluo faction said a word, silently following behind Dian Luohou.

Hua Fuchen took a step forward, but was immediately stopped by Hua Qingying.

"He is in a towering rage right now and won't listen to a single word... We can talk about it later."

Hua Fuchen remained silent for a moment before finally retracting his foot and letting out a long sigh.
