"Are they the Divine Guards of the Pure Land?" Yun Che whispered. These three were not wearing armor, but brocade clothes, clearly not Abyss Knights.

"Yes," Meng Jianxi responded via voice transmission, "They have no right of judgment and almost never leave the Pure Land in their entire lives. They manage everything in the Pure Land and are not as well-regarded as the Abyss Knights in the eyes of the world. However, you must not underestimate them because of this."

"Those profound practitioners who fail the Pure Land trial and are not qualified to become Abyss Knights will be expelled from the Pure Land. However, if they pass the character trial, they will have another choice besides leaving, which is to stay in the Pure Land and become Divine Guards of the Pure Land."

"If they become Divine Guards of the Pure Land, they will likely never be able to step out of the Pure Land again in their entire lives, which is equivalent to giving up their previous lives and being bound to their future lives."

"Most of the Divine Guards of the Pure Land come from this. Once they become Divine Guards, they almost never appear outside the Pure Land, and the world naturally knows very little about them. Their freedom, power, and status are all lower than those of the Abyss Knights."

"However, Yun Che learned from Hua Caili long ago that there is a small number of extremely special Divine Guards in the Pure Land."

"The Divine Guards personally trained by the Four Divine Envoys of the Pure Land."

"Below the True God of the Abyss, there are eleven people at the pinnacle of the Divine Limit Realm, which is also the pinnacle of humanity."

"Six are in the Six Divine Kingdoms, and the Pure Land alone has five."

"Among these five Divine Limits at the pinnacle in the Pure Land, one is an Abyss Knight, and the other four are all Divine Guards of the Pure Land."

"Under the Great Divine Envoy: Dong Huang;"

"Under the Myriad Paths Divine Envoy: Chang Ying;"

"Under the Spirit Immortal Divine Envoy: Su Shang;"

"Under the Six Smiles Divine Envoy: Yuan Ying."

Yun Che couldn't help but sigh, "Even the most insignificant person in the Pure Land is someone no one dares to look down upon."

"Even the most ordinary Divine Guard of the Pure Land is a quasi-knight who failed the trial... and to obtain the qualification to participate in the Pure Land trial, a necessary condition is that one's cultivation must have entered the Divine Extinction Realm."

"In other words, the cultivation of the Divine Guards of the Pure Land is no lower than the Divine Extinction Realm, and in any land, they are qualified to establish a sect."

"Just this concept alone is enough to make people think deeply."

Stepping into the Light Realm, the world suddenly changed.

At first glance, the Pure Land gave Yun Che a feeling of only two words: simple and plain.

There was no imperial splendor as expected, nor was there the natural majesty of a supreme place. At a glance, even the buildings were sparse. Instead, there were various green trees and flowers everywhere.

All the auras here flowed gently, and there was no anxiety or restlessness from any living beings. The light here was so gentle that it seemed to penetrate one's heart, easily soothing all negative emotions.

Yun Che looked around and clearly felt that everyone's breathing had unconsciously slowed down. Those young disciples were amazed, and all showed expressions of intoxication.

Because this was the Pure Land, a world completely free of abyssal dust, a dream realm endlessly revered and yearned for by the creatures of the Abyss.

Meng Jianxi took a long breath in and then a long breath out, followed by an irrepressible sigh, "Although this is not the first time I have come, I still feel like I have stepped into a fairyland... a world completely free of abyssal dust."

"I heard that in the 'Eternal Pure Land,' the entire vast world does not have a trace of abyssal dust. It's simply unimaginable. What a beautiful world that must be."

"Living in such a world, no creature needs to worry about the invasion of abyssal dust at any time. All plants grow naturally, all beasts roam freely, countless races multiply, and even a newborn baby can cry freely... In such a world, creatures must be unimaginably peaceful and harmonious."

"There would be no fear, struggle, or sorrow. Even evil thoughts would be purified and soothed, and there would be no cruel fighting and killing."

Yun Che remained silent.

Meng Jianxi continued, "During this Pure Land audience, the Abyssal Emperor will likely mention the Eternal Pure Land. Are you looking forward to it, Brother Yuan?"

Yun Che showed a look of longing, "Who wouldn't yearn for a world without abyssal dust?"

"It will come true."

Meng Kongchan suddenly spoke faintly, "That once-dreamed-of place is now within reach. Perhaps, in just a few decades, you will be able to stand on that Eternal Pure Land and re-establish and continue our dream-weaving future there, hahahaha."

Amidst Meng Kongchan's laughter, Yun Che and Meng Jianxi had the same expression, but their hearts were surging with completely different emotions.

At this moment, Yun Che's expression suddenly froze, and his footsteps stopped dead in their tracks.

"Brother Yuan, what's wrong?" Meng Jianxi stopped and asked.

"It's nothing," Yun Che shook his head, his expression calm, "I just felt a bit dazed for a moment."

Meng Jianxi understood, "That's normal. Accustomed to the existence of abyssal dust, suddenly entering a world without any abyssal dust can shake one's perception. When I first entered the Pure Land, I also felt dazed several times."

"For profound practitioners of the Abyss to step into the Pure Land is like a fish suddenly entering a clear spring from a long-accustomed foul-smelling mud. It will indeed have a huge impact on their perception."

"However, setting aside the level of the heavenly and earthly auras, the Pure Land, which is like a fairyland and holy land in the eyes of profound practitioners of the Abyss, is just an ordinary world in Yun Che's perception."

Just now, a divine sense had enveloped him.

In that instant, his five senses seemed to sink into an endless sea, not knowing where he came from, where he was going, or where the end was.

That single divine sense seemed to be enough to cover the heavens and earth and devour all worlds.

That divine sense lingered on him for a moment, but it made Yun Che feel as if he had experienced a long period of time.

"Just now... was that?" Li Suo's voice was extremely soft, carrying the deepest and heaviest worry since she woke up.

When she asked, she already knew the answer.

"He discovered me," Yun Che was very calm, both in tone and emotion.

"You... are you really sure how to face him?" Li Suo asked, each word filled with an indescribable worry.

"Yes, don't worry," Yun Che's voice was faint, his heart calm, speaking to Li Suo and also to himself.

A stinging pain came from the depths of his soul sea and gradually intensified.

Fragments.

They were the last two memory fragments from the Evil God Ni Xuan.

They were unexpectedly triggered and shattered when touched by "his" existence.

And this stinging sensation also told Yun Che that the emotional fluctuations carried by these last memory fragments were far greater than before.

The Divine Guards of the Pure Land led them to a courtyard. The furnishings were extremely simple, without any proper guest items. There were only a few profound formations for calming the mind. The most eye-catching things were still the green trees and flowers.

However, the noble people from the Divine Kingdoms did not dare to touch the flowers and trees here, as if they were afraid of desecrating them.

A Divine Guard of the Pure Land said gently, "It is still early. I ask the Dreamless God Child and all the distinguished guests to rest here for a while. When the time comes, the Abyssal Emperor will summon you. In addition, the Pure Land is strictly divided, and there are many forbidden areas. Please do not wander around."

"Okay," Meng Kongchan nodded, "Have the other Divine Kingdoms all arrived?"

The Divine Guard of the Pure Land said, "Currently, only the Weaving Dream and the Heaven Smiting have arrived. The other four Divine Kingdoms and the guests from the Dragon Race are still on their way."

The Divine Guard of the Pure Land left, leaving no attendants behind.

However, no one would think that the Pure Land was being rude.

The stinging pain in Yun Che's soul sea became more and more intense, and he showed this sense of unease on his face.

Meng Kongchan had noticed it long ago and said with concern, "When you first enter the Pure Land, it's easy to feel uneasy, especially since your cultivation is still shallow. If you can't bear it, go and calm your mind for a while to adapt to the aura here."

"Alright," Yun Che obediently agreed, and then said very softly, "If Caili comes, please help me cover it up a little"

"Oh?" Meng Kongchan looked surprised, and then laughed loudly, "You're really a stubborn boy, not wanting to show any weakness to the person you admire. Don't worry, I'll cover for you."

Yun Che didn't say any more, quickly went to a profound formation, sat down, and then opened an isolation barrier, allowing his consciousness to sink into the newly shattered memory fragment.

A vast world, swirling with a catastrophic storm.

The sky was shifting, the earth was trembling, and countless cracks appeared in space every moment, as if countless lightning bolts were raging between heaven and earth.

Even though it was separated by a distant era, Yun Che could still tell from the unique grayish-white color of the sky that this was the world of the Primordial Divine Realm.

But what was presented in the Primordial Kingdom of the Gods was an ancient catastrophe that ordinary people could not even imagine.

Ni Xuan's long hair was disheveled, his once handsome face was now only gray and defeated, covered with overlapping terrible wounds. His outer clothes looked like they had just been pulled out of a blood pool, stained with a bloody red.

He slowly moved his upper body, the action of getting up as difficult as that of a withered old man. But soon, he heavily knelt on the ground again, the blood of the God of Creation dripping from the countless wounds on his body, soaking the Primordial Earth beneath his feet.

He was the Elemental God of Creation, the supreme existence of the current era. No one could imagine... even he himself had never imagined that he would one day be so seriously injured, so wretched, so painful.

In front of him was a tall man in golden clothes.

His facial features gave an extremely clear impression of being carved by a sword.

The first time one looked at his face, the word "upright" would appear in their mind.

As if in front of this face, no law could be violated, no rule could be trampled, no mistake could be forgiven, and no evil could exist.

He was the head of the Four Gods of Creation, the most supreme existence of the current era:

The Heaven Punishing God Emperor - Mo E.

In his hand, he held a wide sword.

The sword was bronze in color, the blade ordinary, blunt and without sharpness, and without any sword pressure. Even if it fell into the mortal world, it would be an ordinary iron that even mortal profound practitioners would not look at.

However, it had a world-shaking name.

The Heaven Punishing Ancestral Sword.

The head of the Seven Great Profound Heavenly Treasures; the first sword of the Primordial Chaos, the ancestor of all weapons in the Primordial Chaos.

He held the Ancestral Sword and stood quietly between heaven and earth. Even if the sky collapsed and the earth cracked, and the storm filled the world, he remained as motionless as a mountain supporting the sky.

He looked indifferently at the blood-stained Elemental God of Creation Ni Xuan, his expression never changing, not even for a moment.

"To defeat me, you did not hesitate to use the power of the Ancestral Sword a second time."

Ni Xuan's voice was so dry that it was hard to believe it was the voice of a God of Creation, "Is this also for the so-called 'righteous path' in your heart!"

If a mortal used the power of the Ancestral Sword, they would die instantly; if a True God used it, their lifespan would be reduced by ninety percent.

Even as strong as a God of Creation, using the power of the Ancestral Sword would consume thirty percent of their lifespan.

This was the second time he had used the Ancestral Sword, and his lifespan as a God of Creation had been greatly reduced by sixty percent.

But he did not hesitate, nor did he have any regrets.

He could not understand Mo E's obsession.

Just as he could not understand why he had to kill Mo Su.

That was clearly his most beloved son! He was his Heaven Punishing Crown Prince, the successor he had chosen for his power and will.

Even if Mo Su had violated the taboo, he did not deserve to die... let alone be executed by him personally.

"You killed Mo Su, harmed Jie Yuan, and took my daughter... Now, it should be my turn."

Ni Xuan smiled miserably, his gray and defeated face showing a hopelessness, "Do it."

Mo E spoke, his voice as light as a cloud, "Although I hate you, I have no reason to kill you."

"Heh!" Ni Xuan laughed softly, "Those who defy your 'righteous path,' even your own son, whom you poured all your love and hope into, you can execute without hesitation, let alone someone like me who defies you."

The storm moved a few strands of Mo E's long hair, hitting his face and revealing a hidden sadness.

Mo E did not raise his sword, nor did any aura emanate from his body.

After a long time, he slowly spoke, but in a tone completely unfamiliar to Ni Xuan, "Ni Xuan, do you know how much I have always envied you?"

Ni Xuan: "............?"

"The name given to you by the Ancestral God contains the word 'Ni' (rebellious), and your personality is so free and unrestrained. You never want to be bound by any existing rules, and you repeatedly rebel against and change those rules and situations that you see as rigid, absurd, unfair, and wrong."

"The world needs a God of Creation like you. Because the evolution of the world and the change of eras require constant change, the breaking of old rules, and the elimination of the filth and shackles of each era."

"The world, from a desolate void to the prosperity of all spirits and all worlds today, has undergone countless corrections and changes."

Ni Xuan looked at Mo E. Perhaps he could not believe that these words were coming from Mo E.

"The world needs someone to constantly change," Mo E also looked at Ni Xuan, "But it also needs someone to hold fast."

"So," Ni Xuan said deeply, "Gods and devils cannot coexist, is that the rule you must hold fast to, and not allow anyone to touch? Even Mo Su, even the Gods of Creation and the Devil Emperors, even if you have to damage your origin so severely, you must eliminate them!?"

Compared to Ni Xuan's sorrow, anger, soul pain, and confusion... Mo E's eyes remained calm, like still water.

Or perhaps, it was a wound so deep that there was no sorrow.

He spoke, "The world is divided into life and death, life is divided into yin and yang, yin and yang are balanced, and all worlds are peaceful."

"The creation of the Ancestral God was based on 'balance,' starting with balance. Without balance, a person stumbles, and without balance, the world will inevitably collapse."

"Therefore, at the beginning of the world, there were Four Gods of Creation and Four Devil Emperors, not Eight Gods of Creation or Eight Devil Emperors."

The Heaven Punishing God Emperor spoke without expression, almost mechanically, saying words he had never said before.

"Since ancient times, the God Race and the Devil Race have been the supreme existences of this world, easily determining the fate of all heavens and all worlds. A small disaster for the God and Devil Races is a catastrophic disaster for all worlds."

"The God and Devil Races are on opposite sides, repelling and restraining each other, forming a long-standing balance. Everything in the world can change, but this balance... must... not... be... touched... or... harmed."

The disaster gradually subsided, and the hissing of space slowed down. Between heaven and earth, only the souls of the two Gods of Creation trembled the winds and clouds of the world.

Ni Xuan's voice pushed the storm towards Mo E, "You only know repulsion and restraint. But integration, is it not another, better balance?"

"You're right, integration may be a better balance."

Mo E, who was always stubborn in Ni Xuan's perception, actually gave him an echo of agreement.

"But any major change should start with a small test, let alone the touch between two races that involves the safety of the world."

"It could be the mortals of the God-Created World and the Devil-Created World, or it could be the gods and devils of the lowest plane... but it cannot be you, Ni Xuan, it cannot be the Heaven Sealing Devil Emperor, and even more so, it cannot be... my son, Mo Su!"

Ni Xuan's pupils paused for a moment.

He realized that his soul was actually moved by it.

"Even so..." These four short words showed that he did not completely reject Mo E's words, "Why did you have to be so cruel to Mo Su, to yourself!"

Mo E finally made a move. He bent his arm, and the Heaven Punishing Ancestral Sword, which was hanging down, slowly moved horizontally in front of him.

"The Four Gods of Creation and the Four Devil Emperors are the beings of the highest plane of the world, but they do not bear the power of the highest plane."

"The ultimate power of the world is carried by the Heaven Punishing Ancestral Sword and the Evil Infant's Wheel of Myriad Tribulations."

"Ni Xuan," he called the name of the Elemental God of Creation, without sorrow or hatred, without resentment or harm, "Do you know why they, who possess the ultimate power, were given such ominous names as 'Heaven Punishing' and 'Myriad Tribulations'?"
