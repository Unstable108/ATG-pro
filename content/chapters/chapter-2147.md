After the initial shock faded, the flames of fury in Dian Sansi’s eyes actually subsided somewhat. As his lips twitched, they even pulled into a slightly twisted smile.

Absurd. Utterly absurd. The Yun Che before him, at the mere fourth level of the Divine Master Realm, intended to fight him in his peak condition… He had never heard such a ridiculous joke in his entire life. A sliver of doubt even arose in his heart… Could it be that Yun Che’s previous actions weren’t a calculated provocation born of malice, but rather that he was simply unhinged?

His lips moved slightly. Mimicking Yun Che’s earlier gesture, he silently mouthed four words.

Idiot… courting… death.

Unfortunately, he lacked Yun Che’s sharp and profound cunning. Though he believed his actions were subtle enough, who among the audience wasn’t a figure of great stature? At least thirty percent of them saw it with perfect clarity.

To secretly taunt and insult an opponent in such a manner during a battle on the sacred Eden Cloud Summit—especially as the second-ranked expert of the younger generation from the Samsara Divine Nation—was undoubtedly a despicable act that invited contempt. Many gazes directed at Dian Sansi turned peculiar, and Dian Luohou’s brow furrowed deeply.

“That little brat!”

Dian Luohou was not one to hold back. He cursed under his breath, his disappointment palpable, “No matter how furious he is, he should never take it out on others. After this battle, I’ll have to drag him over to apologize.”

“…” Dian Jiuzhi maintained a calm facade and nodded in agreement.

Just then, on the battlefield, Dian Sansi made a jaw-dropping gesture. He placed his right hand behind his back and slowly raised his left, holding it horizontally before him. It was the very same ten-breath “courtesy” stance Dian Jiuzhi had used against Shen Wuyi.

The difference was, his gesture was even more extreme than Dian Jiuzhi’s. From his raised left hand, he slowly extended only his little finger.

Although Dian Jiuzhi had ultimately lost to Shen Wuyi, his ten breaths of pure defense were a display of gentlemanly conduct, born from the knowledge that he held a clear advantage. But Dian Sansi’s reenactment of it now only caused brows to furrow deeply. The single, extended pinky was an act of the most naked, extreme contempt.

Veins bulged on Dian Luohou’s forehead. “That little brat! Did he get his brains kicked by a donkey today?! This is just… a clumsy, ugly display!”

He was already enraged, wishing he could just drag his son off the battlefield and slap him hard across the face a few times.

“Your Reverence, please calm your anger,” a Samsara elder advised. “Sansi’s character is by no means like this. This time… Jiuzhi’s defeat has hit him the hardest. He is young, after all, and prone to emotional instability. It’s somewhat understandable. We can simply discipline him more upon our return.”

Dian Sansi’s emotional state was indeed one he believed to be relatively calm, but in reality, it was already half out of control. When reason is overwhelmed by a torrent of negative emotions that can only be suppressed and not released, it is not surprising for one to act contrary to their usual self.

He stared at Yun Che and spoke in a voice that was still somewhat detached, “My Samsara Divine Nation has never deigned to bully others with our strength. I grant you ten breaths. I will only defend, not attack!”

Yun Che smiled. “I am most grateful for Brother Sansi’s generosity. In that case, it would be more respectful to accept than to decline.”

As his words fell, he shot into the air, charging straight for Dian Sansi. The profound energy around him surged violently as he threw a simple punch.

The aura of a fourth-level Divine Master was unmistakable, dashing the hopes of those who had secretly anticipated some kind of “surprise.” There were no more flukes to be had.

And to Dian Sansi, the power of a mere Divine Master posed no threat whatsoever. He stared fixedly as Yun Che approached, the contempt and disdain on his face now completely undisguised.

He bent his extended pinky halfway before slowly moving it to meet Yun Che’s seemingly full-powered right fist. The profound energy flowing from his body didn’t even amount to ten percent of his strength.

The instant his finger and the fist made contact, however, Dian Sansi caught a flicker of mockery in Yun Che’s eyes, which were now just inches away.

Heaven Smiting!

In that single moment, Yun Che’s aura exploded with a magnitude that no one had anticipated, a magnitude beyond their wildest imagination. A turbulent wave of air instantly blasted away the atmosphere within the battlefield barrier, creating a sky full of explosive ripples.

In Dian Sansi’s pupils, which had dilated tenfold in an instant, he saw his own pinky finger snap at a horrifying angle. The fist, carrying immense power, shattered his finger but lost none of its momentum, slamming directly into his chest and sinking half its length deep.

BOOM!!

A blast of profound energy, far louder than expected, erupted, accompanied by Dian Sansi’s instinctive, guttural scream.

His body tumbled backward, flying for several dozen zhang¹ before he finally regained his senses. He hastily released his profound energy and landed heavily. He clutched his violently trembling left hand, his broken pinky dangling limply. His face was a mask of bewildered shock… and terrifying ferocity.

The surroundings fell into a stunning, deathly silence, which was then shattered by an even more astonishing uproar.

One by one, the powerful experts who stood proudly atop the Abyss contorted their faces in extreme shock, their mouths agape or their eyes bulging. Divine Sovereign Jue Luo’s eyes were wide, Divine Sovereign Xing Yue’s gaze was frozen, and Divine Sovereign Qi Heng leaned forward. Even Divine Sovereign Wu Meng’s eyes twitched fiercely.

“This… this… this…” Meng Jianxi, who thought she was considerably prepared, was still so shocked she could barely speak.

Behind the High Priest, the East Radiance Divine Attendant, unable to contain his surprise, whispered, “Master, his cultivation… is it concealed?”

The High Priest’s voice was grave. “No matter how brilliant the concealment, it cannot escape my eyes. He is indeed at the fourth level of the Divine Master Realm. But in that instant, with that cultivation, he unleashed power comparable to the first level of the Divine Extinction Realm.”

This scene completely defied his understanding of the profound way as the High Priest. The East Radiance Divine Attendant opened his mouth but was at a loss for words.

The High Priest seemed to be muttering to himself, “I just don’t know if that power was merely for an instant, or if…”

His gaze fell upon Yun Che, more focused than it had been at any point during the Battle of the Divine Children. A storm of shocked cries filled the air, but all that could be seen of Dian Sansi was a pathetic figure… both in expression and in body.

“You…” Shock, fury, and humiliation warred within Dian Sansi. His only answer was Yun Che’s figure closing in on him once more.

This time, how could Dian Sansi dare to be so arrogant? The Myriad Manifestations of Samsara Art circulated at high speed, cloaking his body in a thick layer of silver brilliance… He had directly unleashed fifty percent of his profound energy.

Three breaths ago, he would never have dreamed that he would need to use half his strength to deal with a fourth-level Divine Master.

Bang!

With a dull thud, Yun Che’s fist once again slammed into Dian Sansi’s chest. This time, however, his power was completely blocked by the formidable Samsara energy, failing to push him back even half a step.

But this stalemate lasted only for a moment before Dian Sansi saw an even deeper mockery in Yun Che’s eyes.

Hades!

BOOM!

Like a volcano suddenly awakening from its slumber and erupting in his chest, the silver brilliance flowing around Dian Sansi’s body instantly disintegrated. His chest caved in even more grotesquely than before, and the sound of his ribs breaking was as loud as a landslide.

“Wh-what!?” In that instant, countless experts, known for their composure, cried out in shock.

Some of the younger profound practitioners nearly dropped their jaws to the floor.

Amidst the horrifyingly clear sound of shattering bones, Dian Sansi, who had already unleashed fifty percent of his power, was sent flying once again. Yun Che’s figure followed like a shadow, closing the distance in a flash.

While still flying backward, Dian Sansi let out a cathartic roar. The scattered silver brilliance around him suddenly flared, carrying an endlessly frenzied pressure… This time, it was the Myriad Manifestations of Samsara Art operating at its full, unrestrained power.

The astonishing wave of air and spiritual pressure visibly slowed Yun Che’s advance. At that moment, Dian Sansi flipped over in mid-air, the silver brilliance in his hand forming a blade that stabbed straight toward Yun Che’s heart.

“Brother Yuan!”

Meng Jianxi cried out subconsciously, and the entire Dreamweaver contingent gasped in horror, their faces pale. Dian Sansi, who had arrogantly declared he would grant ten breaths and only defend, had suddenly counterattacked… and with a sudden burst of his full power at that.

Even if the power Yun Che had unleashed completely transcended the Divine Master Realm… his body was still that of a Divine Master. How could it possibly withstand a full-powered strike from a demigod?

Shhhlick!

The blade of light left a trail of spatial ripples in its wake, but it only tore through Yun Che’s afterimage. Dian Sansi’s assault did not stop there; the silver brilliance instantly transformed into a thousand-zhang-long blade that swept horizontally forward without reservation.

Cries of alarm overlapped with an even more terrifying sound of something breaking. A horrifying, thousand-zhang-long silver scar was carved into the battlefield. Meanwhile, Yun Che, using Moon Splitting Cascade, executed several ghostly flashes and reappeared at the other end of the battlefield, completely unharmed.

“Phew…”

Meng Jianxi finally let out a long sigh of relief, then gritted her teeth. “Is Dian Sansi insane?!”

“Hah!”

Dian Luohou also let out a great breath before roaring, “You bastard! Have you lost your mind?!”

Dian Luohou’s roar was like a bucket of cold water poured over his head, jolting Dian Sansi from his emotional spiral and back to a semblance of clarity. He froze on the spot. If he had been careless just now and killed Yun Che in front of everyone, the consequences… At this thought, a chill ran down his spine.

But how could Yun Che allow him to truly regain his composure?

The warm smile on his face had transformed into a cold sneer, three parts icy and seven parts mocking. “I have often heard that the profound practitioners of Samsara value righteousness and honor above all, that their word is their bond. Brother Sansi just unequivocally declared a courtesy of ten breaths, to only defend and not attack. Not even three breaths have passed, and you’ve already broken your promise… and launched a sudden sneak attack! Heh, Brother Sansi’s integrity is truly an eye-opener!”

No one found Yun Che’s change in demeanor strange, nor would anyone blame him for this merciless rebuke.

Dian Sansi’s various antics had come first. The ten-breath courtesy was his own proposal, and his nearly frenzied, vicious counterattack had been witnessed by all. Even someone with the best temperament would have flown into a rage on the spot.

“That bastard!” Veins popped on Dian Luohou’s forehead. He wasn’t angry at Yun Che, but at Dian Sansi… In his fury, he felt too ashamed to even look Meng Kongchan in the eye.

Dian Sansi turned his head and met the contemptuous gazes from all around.

The emotions that had just cooled by a fraction were instantly swallowed by a humiliation several times greater. His breathing became extremely heavy, his chest heaving as if it would explode.

It was all Yun Che’s fault… Yun Che’s private demeanor and words were so ugly and vicious… Why am I the one enduring these looks? Why have I become the villain who is looked down upon?!

Why is such a despicable person the Dreamweaver Divine Son? Why could he make the Zhe Tian Divine Maiden abandon Brother Jiuzhi for him? Why can he, as a Divine Master, unleash such unbelievable power… Why… On what grounds…

Meeting his chaotic gaze, Yun Che slowly raised a hand, his voice cold and hard. “Brother Sansi could have gone all out from the very beginning. Since I, Yun Che, dared to fight, then victory, defeat… even life and death are determined by fate alone. But for Brother Sansi to act in such a manner is simply too despicable, too shameful.”

“Heh… hehe.”

Dian Sansi began to laugh, but the sound was foreign even to his own ears. “Good… very good. All out, determined by fate alone. You… said that yourself!!”

The moment his voice fell, he swiped his right hand through the air. Five silver arrows of light shot out, piercing through space toward Yun Che. At the same time, the silver brilliance on his body slowly gathered toward his right arm, until it bloomed into an incredibly deep silver profound light on his right hand.

The five light arrows traveled at different speeds, arriving one after another. Yun Che’s figure flickered, leaving behind five afterimages that dodged all five arrows… but as the last afterimage dissipated, Dian Sansi’s figure had already lunged forward, carrying a crushing pressure like a collapsing mountain.

“Myriad Manifestations of Samsara… Great Desolation Star Devourer!”

The incomparably tyrannical Samsara energy condensed in his right arm as he aimed a punch straight at Yun Che’s chest, clearly intending to repay the two punches Yun Che had landed on him a hundredfold.

The might unleashed by Dian Sansi’s full power seemed to pin Yun Che in place, making it difficult for him to move. He made no attempt to retreat. Instead, he swung his own right hand forward, and a golden flame exploded in his palm to meet the attack head-on.

BOOM!!

It was as if a thousand thunderclaps had exploded over the Eden Cloud Summit. The Samsara energy and the golden flames detonated simultaneously, and the dense silver brilliance and blazing light completely engulfed the two figures.

Everyone’s pupils were filled with the glare of silver and gold. Already wide with shock, their eyes dilated even further, almost to the point of bursting from sheer astonishment.

This was Dian Sansi’s full-powered Samsara energy, with not a single shred held back. And yet, it was completely blocked head-on by Yun Che… with the power and body of a fourth-level Divine Master, without him being pushed back even half a step!!

The impact of this scene was so great that no words in the world could describe it.

Shen Wuyi defeating Dian Jiuzhi while being two minor realms lower had already left the Divine Sovereigns in a state of prolonged shock. But what they were experiencing now was a complete and utter collapse of their cognition.

Gulp!

An abnormally loud swallowing sound came from both Cha Xing and He Yue at the same time.

Dian Jiuzhi himself was completely stunned where he stood… He had personally witnessed Yun Che in action and had even estimated his limits to the greatest extent possible, yet now he was too shocked for words.

“This… can’t be real, can it?” Pan Buzhuo muttered, his spirit shaken.

In Shen Wuyi’s moon-like eyes, there was only golden flame, no silver brilliance. Her vision, because of this golden flame, once again fell into that strange haze… This time, it took a full breath before she regained her cold clarity.

The High Priest uttered in a low voice, “Golden Crow’s Flame…”

Amidst the silver brilliance and golden flames, Dian Sansi and Yun Che’s fists were locked, their gazes meeting at close range. One’s face was ferocious, veins bulging, while the other wore a faint, leisurely smile, calm and composed.

Dian Sansi’s eyes were filled with terrifying blood vessels. His arm trembled as his Samsara divine power surged madly, yet he was unable to force Yun Che back even a fraction of an inch.

At that moment, a strange silver light suddenly flashed in Yun Che’s pupils.

This fluctuation of soul energy was easily detected by the powerful experts. They instantly recognized it as the core profound art of the Dreamweaver Divine Nation, the “Dreamweaver Divine Tome’s” first stage—Fleeting Dream of Youth.

As the Dreamweaver Divine Son, it was perfectly normal and reasonable to use the Dreamweaver Divine Tome in battle. However, this first-stage soul technique was ultimately too weak. It was difficult to exert soul suppression on a profound practitioner of the same realm, let alone with the soul of a mere Divine Master.

Or could it be… that his soul, like his unbelievably powerful profound energy and body, could also unleash soul might comparable to the Divine Extinction Realm??

Under normal circumstances, Dian Sansi would have immediately noticed and defended against the Dreamweaver Divine Tome.

But in his current state, Dian Sansi could barely control himself, let alone be on guard. The Fleeting Dream of Youth Yun Che cast entered his soul sea like a tiny spark being silently dropped into a wildly boiling pot of oil.

Under the cover of the Golden Crow’s flames, his lips moved slightly: Idiot, go on being the worthless coward you are.

Dian Sansi’s pupils instantly shattered.

And the flames on Yun Che’s body erupted violently.

God… Ash!

BOOM-WMMMM!

The Golden Crow howled, its flames covering the heavens. In a mere instant, the silver brilliance was completely devoured by the flames, and a figure engulfed in fire shot out from the inferno, letting out a sky-rending, miserable scream.

“Waaaaahhhhhh!!”

The scream was so wretched that the hearts of the younger profound practitioners clenched. The burning figure streaked across the sky for several thousand zhang before finally flying out of the barrier.

Dian Luohou raised his hand, and a wave of profound energy caught him mid-air, slamming him heavily onto the ground. The golden flames on his body were extinguished in an instant. His actions were rough, clearly showing his immense anger, but as the flames died down, the miserable state Dian Sansi was in caused the rebuke in his throat to get stuck, unable to come out.

His clothes had been reduced to ashes, his exposed skin was covered in scorched black marks, half his hair was gone, and his face was a ghastly sight. Although these were not severe injuries, to be displayed in such an ugly state in public, coupled with his performance today, his reputation, even if not completely ruined, would be forever stained.

“Father… cough… cough cough…” He opened his mouth, only to choke out a mouthful of black smoke, a sight both ugly and comical. It was clear that even his throat had been burned by those terrifying flames.

He could feel the gazes from the surroundings, which had shifted from the earlier contempt to… pity, a feeling a thousand times more dreadful than contempt.

Just then, the High Priest’s announcement rang in his ears: “Dian Sansi of the Samsara Divine Nation has left the barrier. Meng Jian Yuan of Dreamweaver is victorious.”

An uproar immediately followed—cries of shock, gasps of amazement… rising and falling in waves, forming a tragic contrast to his miserable plight.

The world spun before his eyes. He heard the sound of his own soul-string snapping.

He pushed himself up, all his beliefs and willpower transforming into a heart-wrenching roar: “Your Reverence! Father God! Yun Che, he…”

“Sansi!!” Dian Jiuzhi, utterly horrified, lunged forward and clamped his hand tightly over his mouth.

But Dian Sansi, who usually obeyed Dian Jiuzhi’s every word, erupted with astonishing strength. He violently shook off his hand and continued to shriek in a voice so hoarse it sounded like a despairing ghost: “Yun Che and Zhe Tian Huacai Li are having an affair! I saw it with my own eyes! With my own eyes!!”
