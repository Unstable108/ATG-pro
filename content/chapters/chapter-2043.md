"Your thoughts are in turmoil..." Li Suo's reminder came.

"Mm."

Yun Che did not deny it. "I can't help but wonder what happened to her during all these years in the Abyss."

Li Suo sighed softly. "I know too little about her. But regarding the Daughter of Glazed Glass... as I said before, although she can conjure Glazed Glass Ice, she completely lacks the limpid aura a Daughter of Glazed Glass should possess. At the very least, the Daughters of Glazed Glass I have known would never exhibit an emotion like 'indifference'."

"However, these abnormalities are not something we can find answers to by investigating now. Moreover... a flicker of killing intent arose in you just now, and Meng Kongchan was right beside you. If everyone's attention hadn't been focused on Shen Wuyi and Shen Wuyanye, it's highly likely he would have noticed... This is the first time you've made such a lapse since entering the Abyss."

"Don't worry," Yun Che said. "Even if it were discovered, I have plenty of excuses to explain it away."

At this, he calmed his emotions once more, no longer trying to argue or make excuses. He admitted, "Alright, you're right. I was indeed a bit... unseemly today."

"Not unseemly. On the contrary, the you of today is more like Yun Che, rather than the 'Emperor Yun' you force yourself to be countless times every day."

Li Suo's voice was as gentle as an immortal's cloud, no different from usual, yet it left Yun Che stunned for a moment before he shook his head and chuckled.

"Those are certainly heartwarming words, probably very effective for coaxing a girl new to the world. A pity... with the burdens I carry, indulging in my own feelings in this world is an unforgivable sin. I will be more vigilant."

Li Suo fell silent for a long while before speaking again. "There is one more thing I must remind you of. While you were gazing at Shen Wuyi, Hua Caili was gazing at you."

Yun Che's heart skipped a beat... Damn it! No matter how much he admonished himself or fortified his mental defenses, he was not a soulless Abyssal Beast. In this world, there were always things that could create a breach in his willpower... such as Xia Qingyue. Fortunately, Hua Caili's disposition was exceedingly simple. To Yun Che, she was one of the easiest types of people to handle in the Abyss.

He closed his eyes for a moment, as if pondering something, then suddenly opened them. His gaze, as if by instinct, turned first toward Hua Caili, meeting hers at that exact moment. A faint, hazy mist seemed to veil her eyes, reflecting a young girl's chaotic, unspoken emotions and hesitation. Yun Che blinked, the corners of his lips tilting up ever so slightly. Then, his gaze shifted away naturally, moving toward Dian Jiuzhi.

That single, fleeting glance and faint smile were enough to involuntarily disperse the turbulent currents coiling in Hua Caili's heart. The icy mist in her beautiful eyes melted away, returning them to their flawless, starry brilliance.

Hua Qingying, who had been sensing the changes in Hua Caili's emotions, turned her lovely eyes and said softly, "The abnormalities Shen Wuyi has displayed are far too shocking. Neither your Royal Father nor I could help but be shaken. It is perfectly normal for Yun Che to fix his gaze on her. There is no need to be so sensitive or concerned."

Caught off guard, Hua Caili's snowy face flushed with embarrassment. She quickly retorted, "Th-that's not it! I... I know best how Big Brother Yun feels about me. I wasn't concerned at all. Auntie, you're talking nonsense."

"...It seems my senses were mistaken."

"They were!"

"..."

Beside them, Hua Fuchen shook his head with a helpless smile. The corner of his eye caught sight of Dian Luohou dispelling the cold energy for Dian Jiuzhi, and he sighed inwardly again.

As the foremost God-Venerate of the Six God Kingdoms, Dian Luohou's Samsara¹ power was immensely formidable. The cold energy on Dian Jiuzhi's body had already been completely dispelled. Though his face was still a bit pale, he had managed to recover his ability to move. With Dian Jiuzhi's cultivation, it wouldn't take long for his frostbitten body to heal, but Dian Sansi was still supporting him carefully.

Just then, Dian Sansi suddenly felt a gaze pierce him like a needle. This gaze made no attempt to hide its aggression; in fact, it didn't mind at all... rather, it seemed intentional that he should notice it. As the second strongest of the Samsara God Kingdom's younger generation, second only to Dian Jiuzhi, how could Dian Sansi tolerate such a provocation? His eyes sharpened instantly, and he shot a glare back toward the source, his gaze colliding with Yun Che's in mid-air.

Yun Che narrowed his eyes slightly, the corner of his mouth twitching almost imperceptibly, before he casually looked away.

Dian Sansi's hands suddenly clenched... He had clearly seen the mockery in Yun Che's eyes and, even more clearly, the words his lips formed in silence: Useless... trash...

Dian Jiuzhi, still weak from his injuries, felt a sharp pain from Dian Sansi's tightening grip. He turned his head and asked, "Sansi, what's wrong?"

Dian Sansi hastily loosened his fingers and forced a smile. "It's nothing. It's just... I just... can't accept this."

As he spoke the last few words, he couldn't stop himself from gritting his teeth.

Dian Jiuzhi, however, thought Dian Sansi was referring to his defeat. He smiled and comforted him, "When your skills are inferior, you must accept defeat. As for the insults... that was the Unnamed God-Venerate. Pay her no mind."

Dian Sansi opened his mouth... On the Pure Land, before the Abyssal Emperor, with all the God-Venerates present, he could not explain. But that heart-stabbing gaze fell upon him once more.

Dian Sansi's eyes filled with fury as he stared straight at Yun Che. But faced with his terrifying glare, Yun Che was neither startled nor afraid. Instead, the curve of his lips widened... Though no words were spoken, the disdain, mockery, and contempt crashed into the depths of his soul like a surging tide.

Look, I stole Hua Caili, the one betrothed to Dian Jiuzhi, and he doesn't even dare to act out... Useless trash!

Look, the so-called number one God-Child was beaten into a "frozen dead dog"... Useless trash!

Look, you know everything, yet you don't even dare to let out a fart... Useless trash!

The number one God-Child, hahahaha... In my eyes, you're just a massive joke! The biggest coward in the God Kingdoms!

You're seething with impotent rage... Oh, but trash like you is only capable of impotent rage! You're worse than a stray dog that can at least still bark!

...Darkness swam before Dian Sansi's eyes. Though it was only a momentary exchange of glances, the look from Yun Che was too soul-piercing, too derisive... It wasn't even the look of someone gazing down on the weak, but more like pity for a pathetic, miserable bug... The fire of hatred that had always been coiled in his heart, suppressed with nearly all his willpower, was agitated to the brink of boiling over once more.

"Hm?" Dian Luohou suddenly turned his head, his gaze falling on Dian Sansi, whose aura was clearly in disarray.

Dian Sansi took a deep breath and lowered his head. "Royal Father, no one has ever dared to humiliate Brother Jiuzhi like this. I... I really..."

Dian Luohou looked away and said in a deep voice, "The defeated should have the awareness of the defeated. If you cannot accept it, then use it as motivation and repay it tenfold in the future. As for that madwoman from Eternal Night, ignore her."

Dian Sansi acknowledged him, then kept his head bowed for a long time without another word, his jaw clenched so tightly it could not relax.

Why... On what grounds... My Samsara God Kingdom is clearly the strongest... Even though Brother Jiuzhi was defeated, he was once the number one God-Child... He did nothing wrong... He was the one being tolerant, the one enduring, the one considering the bigger picture... That was a betrothal personally bestowed by the Abyssal Emperor... The fault clearly lies with Yun Che, with Hua Caili, with the Dream-Weaving and Heaven-Rending God Kingdoms... Why is it Brother Jiuzhi, why is it us who must suffer this humiliation...

Crrk... crrk... He could faintly hear the sound of his own teeth cracking.

At this moment, Shen Wuyi's figure had returned to the center of the barrier, but for a long time, no one challenged her.

Her eyes, like tranquil pools in the darkest night, fell directly upon the Dream-Weaving God Kingdom.

"Dream-Weaving God-Child, Meng Jianxi, please enlighten me."

As expected, Meng Jianxi was neither surprised nor flustered. He took a step forward and announced frankly, "Though I have always considered myself extraordinary, in a battle between peers, I am no match for the Samsara God-Child. Thus, I am even less likely to be a match for the Eternal Night Divine Maiden."

"Therefore, I can only shamelessly admit defeat."

Meng Jianxi's response truly surprised no one. That unsolvable Exquisite Profound Realm, that perception-shattering, bizarre ice... not fighting was the most rational choice, and not one that would invite ridicule.

"Hahahahaha!"

That ear-piercing laughter rang out, just as expected. "Is this the God-Child of the Dream-Weaving God Kingdom? He doesn't even have the guts to accept a challenge. Are you all prepared to hand the next generation of your God Kingdoms over to this bunch of useless trash?"

Meng Kongchan spoke coolly, "For a God-Venerate to publicly utter such humiliating words to a junior, one must say... you truly live up to your title as the Unnamed God-Venerate! With your guidance, the Eternal Night God Kingdom must surely be flourishing and prosperous, a source of pride for all its people."

Shen Wuyanye sneered. "A God Kingdom whose very dreams are rotten and foul, a successor who doesn't even dare to fight. Your Dream-Weaving God Kingdom is destined only to grovel at the feet of my Eternal Night. What right do you have to comment on my God Kingdom!"

Meng Kongchan gave a faint, cold snort and did not reply, showing no anger whatsoever.

With Meng Jianxi choosing to forfeit directly, the only God Kingdom that had not yet entered the field was Heaven-Rending. Just as everyone thought Hua Caili would also choose to avoid the battle, a beautiful white light streaked across the air. The young woman's figure had already landed gracefully within the barrier, directly facing Shen Wuyi.

"..." Hua Fuchen subconsciously raised a hand.

"Let her try," Hua Qingying said calmly. "Caili's sword is enough to deal with the Exquisite Profound Realm."

Hua Fuchen frowned slightly, then, as if suddenly realizing something, his eyes revealed an undisguisable shock. "You mean, Caili... she..."

Meeting Hua Fuchen's clearly turbulent gaze, Hua Qingying nodded slightly. "This was the surprise she had prepared for you, and the trump card she painstakingly practiced to earn a reward from the Abyssal Emperor."

She suddenly let out a soft sigh, looking at the two in the barrier with a touch of melancholy. "She was originally almost certain she could defeat a Dian Jiuzhi of the same realm. She just never expected such a dazzling and bizarre Eternal Night Divine Maiden to appear. Caili is already fated not to get her wish."

"Since she is fated not to get her wish, why still..." Hua Fuchen stopped mid-sentence, understanding dawning on him. He sighed, half amused and half helpless. "In the end, it is still the whim of a young girl."

"Heaven-Rending Divine Maiden, Hua Caili. It is a pleasure to meet you. Please enlighten me!"

In the center of the barrier, the two women stood a hundred paces apart. Before a single move was made, the entire audience held its breath, mesmerized. Even the gentle breeze and thin clouds seemed to pause for them.

Shen Wuyi was clad in ink-black robes, a cold mist seeming to linger around the hems as they fell. Her battle with Dian Jiuzhi had left her hair slightly disheveled, a few strands falling beside her cheeks, which only served to accentuate the jade-white translucence of her exquisite face.

Her eyes were like frozen pools, beautiful as an immortal's dream, yet devoid of any gentle charm, holding only a distancing indifference. The Glazed Glass Ice aura circulating slowly around her bestowed upon her a halo of sacred, aloof light, making her seem like a goddess of ice and snow descended from the nine heavens—beautiful in her sharp, solitary pride.

Hua Caili wore the snow-white cloud robes unique to the Heaven-Rending Divine Maiden. Embroidered upon her skirt were seven distinctly different sword radiances, interwoven with complex and magnificent divine star patterns: Dubhe, Merak, Phecda, Megrez, Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid... The seven stars of the Dipper shone together, symbolizing not only the adoration of the Seven Heaven-Rending Sword-Venerates, but also their eternally present protection. As she moved, her skirt swayed, instantly resembling a cascading river of stars, shimmering with brilliant light.

Her beauty was a heaven-sent treasure, long famed throughout the Abyss and known to all. Her skin was as fair and smooth as fine jade, her cheeks naturally blushed with a faint rosy hue, as if untouched by the Abyssal dust of the Fog Sea or the vanities of the mortal world. Her brows were slender and curved like a rising crescent moon, and her beautiful eyes still reflected the brightest stars of the Abyss, carrying with them the fragile purity unique to a young maiden.

Two peerlessly beautiful women, each with a completely different temperament, appeared in the same frame. It was a magnificent tableau that no one in the Six God Kingdoms had ever been fortunate enough to witness.

Outside the barrier, some stared blankly, others were lost in a daze, and some struggled to maintain their composure... but the sound of their collective breathing was almost inaudibly low. Every pair of eyes seemed to have forgotten how to reflect the light, as if the world atop the Eden Cloud Summit had suddenly lost all its color.

AI Translation Notes:
1:
Samsara (森罗 - Sēnluó): The original term means "all-encompassing" or "myriad things," often used in Buddhist contexts to describe the vastness of the universe or the cycle of reincarnation (samsara). "Samsara" is chosen here to maintain consistency with established translations for this series and to give the God Kingdom a suitably grand and profound name.

2:
Dubhe, Merak, Phecda, Megrez, Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid (天枢、天璇、天玑、天权、玉衡、开阳、摇光 - Tiānshū, Tiānxuán, Tiānjī, Tiānquán, Yùhéng, Kāiyáng, Yáoguāng): These are the Chinese names for the seven stars of the Big Dipper constellation. The English translation uses their internationally recognized astronomical names to convey the celestial theme.
