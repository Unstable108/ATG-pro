At this moment, a silver figure suddenly descended from the sky, instantly dispelling the oppressive aura that enveloped Yun Che. Meng Kongchan's figure appeared from above, standing in front of Yun Che, and he spoke with a faint smile, "I was just about to pay a visit, but I didn't expect to encounter you here. It's been a long time since we last met, Grand Divine Official, I hope all is well?"

In response to God Venerable Wumeng's words, the Grand Divine Official remained unresponsive, his gaze still fixed on Yun Che.

Meng Kongchan frowned slightly, then said, "This is my humble son, Jianyuan. He was lost for a hundred years and only recently found, thus he has been neglected in his upbringing. This is also his first time in the Pure Land¹, so he is bound to be ignorant and reckless. If he has offended the Grand Divine Official in any way, I hope the Grand Divine Official will be magnanimous and overlook it for now. Once this matter is settled, I will certainly bring Jianyuan to apologize to the Grand Divine Official."

The Grand Divine Official, however, remained deaf to his words, his eyes like bottomless black abysses.

He spoke again, his might and pressure several times greater than before: "Answer me, where did your Buddhic Power² come from!"

The space between the Grand Divine Official and God Venerable Wumeng suddenly twisted. As the terrifying divine voice fell, the corner of God Venerable Wumeng's robe was slightly lifted, fluttering erratically.

"Buddhic Power?" Meng Kongchan turned to look at Yun Che, his eyes clearly showing shock. Even with God Venerable Wumeng's protection, the overwhelming divine pressure still made Yun Che's head throb. Yet, his mind remained incredibly clear and rapidly processed, re-organizing the answer he had already prepared.

This answer was originally intended for when he would directly face the Abyss Emperor³. The memory fragments left by the Evil God Ni Xuan⁴ clearly informed him of the Abyss Emperor's true identity. They also clearly told him that the Great Dao Buddhic Art⁵ he cultivated was created by the Abyss Emperor. And the Desolate God⁶ was a god "created" by the Abyss Emperor during the Age of Gods⁷ using the Great Dao Buddhic Art. Therefore, if the Abyss Emperor's identity was correct, he would certainly easily detect the Buddhic Power within Yun Che's body. However, he hadn't expected to encounter the Grand Divine Official before facing the Abyss Emperor. He had to quickly re-evaluate whether this answer would also be "applicable" to the Grand Divine Official within this extremely short time. Yun Che looked up, meeting the Grand Divine Official's gaze, and only then did he clearly see his appearance. His face, and indeed his entire body, were etched with dominance and fortitude, so intense that it almost overshadowed everything else, making it impossible to discern his age.

The sharpness of his features seemed keen enough to cut through time, and the darkness in his eyes was so profound it seemed capable of devouring the entire Abyss World⁸. The moment before Yun Che spoke, a voice drifted down from beyond the heavens.

"Huang⁹, step down." The voice was like light rain, like a gentle breeze, seemingly real yet dreamlike. Though devoid of any emotion, it brought a sense of peace to the heart, like bathing in a clear spring. The divine pressure covering Yun Che instantly dissipated. The Grand Divine Official's gaze lingered on Yun Che for another moment, then he moved away without hesitation, leaving not a single word.

Meng Kongchan looked puzzled, but clearly let out a sigh of relief, and said loudly, "Farewell, Grand Divine Official."

Slowly retracting his external aura, Meng Kongchan turned around and asked in a gentle voice, "Yuan'er, do you truly possess the 'Buddhic Power' that the Grand Divine Official spoke of?"

Yun Che hesitated for a moment, but then nodded and explained, "Among the teachings my master imparted, there is a body-tempering profound art called the 'Great Dao Buddhic Art'. The power derived from it, which resides within me, should be what the Grand Divine Official referred to as 'Buddhic Power'."

"My master instructed me not to reveal anything about him to outsiders, and I don't know why the Grand Divine Official was able to perceive it with a single glance..."

He murmured to himself, "Could it be that my master has some connection with the Grand Divine Official?"

"..." Meng Kongchan frowned, deep in thought.

"Senior God Venerable, was that voice just now..."

Yun Che's voice faltered slightly, as if he dared not easily utter that supreme name.

"Voice?? What voice??"

As the question left his lips, Meng Kongchan instantly understood: "No wonder he suddenly left after just making trouble, it was actually..."

His gaze became somewhat complex, but being in the Pure Land, he dared not make wild guesses or rash inferences for the time being.

"Yuan'er, your master's background is probably far beyond imagination."

"Perhaps he doesn't want to be involved with the mortal world anymore, but in the eyes of the Supreme Pure Land, no secret in the world can remain hidden."

Meng Kongchan didn't press further, but instead sighed with emotion, "However, this is by no means a bad thing for you. From what just happened, it might even... bring unimaginable benefits to your future."

"Mm."

Yun Che's eyes reflected emotion: "My master's protection is always with me, in my body and in my heart."

Meng Kongchan smiled, "Come back with me. Although your safety is absolutely assured in the Pure Land, I always feel uneasy when you're not by my side."

"Yes." Meng Kongchan took Yun Che and had just ascended when a gust of sword wind pierced through the air, followed by that cold and stunningly beautiful immortal figure.

Meng Kongchan's originally solemn expression instantly blossomed into a smile as the corners of his mouth curved: "Qingying..."

Hua Qingying's gaze swept over Yun Che's entire body in an instant, her voice chilling: "You were just locked onto by the Grand Divine Official's divine sense¹⁰??"

Clearly, she had sensed something and rushed over in worry.

"Thank you for your concern, Aunt."

Yun Che quickly said, "The Grand Divine Official might have sensed something unusual about my aura, so he merely inquired a bit, with no other intentions."

Hua Qingying's tightly furrowed crescent eyebrows, however, did not relax. Yun Che didn't know that outside the Pure Land, Hua Qingying was the one who understood the Grand Divine Official best and had the most frequent contact with him, even more so than the God Venerables of the Six Nations¹¹. The Abyss Emperor's temperament was extremely gentle, while the Grand Divine Official's was extremely cold and indifferent.

He almost never showed a pleasant expression to anyone outside the Pure Land. Even towards Hua Caili, who possessed world-toppling beauty, a pure heart like jade, and was beloved by everyone in the Pure Land, he would only regard her with cold eyes. In Hua Qingying's memory, the Grand Divine Official had never before focused his divine sense so thoroughly on a junior from a divine nation.

Glancing in the direction where the Grand Divine Official's aura had departed, the coldness in Hua Qingying's eyes finally eased a bit: "That's for the best. Before this, did you go to see Dian Luohou and Dian Jiuzhi?"

"I was just about to ask about that myself," Meng Kongchan said.

Yun Che honestly replied, "Yes. Caili and I will eventually have to face God Venerable Jueluo and Divine Son Senluo. At a time like this, I felt I should try to understand them as much as possible."

Meng Kongchan sighed softly, half-relieved and half-admonishing, "Yuan'er, your father knows you have a sense of responsibility far beyond your age and..."

"Leave this matter to God Venerable Wumeng and God Venerable Huaxin."

Hua Qingying stared at Yun Che, her voice icy but not harsh: "Yun Che, with the change in your identity and your perfect divine core revealed to the world, the obstacles between you and Caili are already much smaller than they were initially. I know your heart for Caili is one of deep affection born from unwavering devotion, and you want to do as much as you can with your own strength, but the entanglements involved are not something you can directly face right now."

"Acting too hastily might backfire."

Yun Che lowered his head, saying with a hint of guilt, "Aunt's lesson is right; I was indeed a bit too eager, causing Aunt to worry."

"Uh... yes... that's right."

God Venerable Wumeng, completely ignored, could only offer an awkward smile, like a simple and taciturn old father.

"Deep affection is not a fault; there's no need to blame yourself. Just knowing is enough."

Hua Qingying turned around and continued to instruct, "This Pure Land Assembly¹² is of extraordinary significance, and there will surely be competition among divine sons and divine daughters. It's best to stay close to your father at all times, so you won't be affected by any stray energy."

"Yes, I've noted it. Farewell, Aunt."

Meng Kongchan watched Hua Qingying depart until she was far away, then reluctantly withdrew his gaze. He wasn't jealous of Yun Che's obedience in front of Hua Qingying; instead, he was quite pleased.

"Your aunt is right. Just leave the matter between you and Caili to us elders."

Yun Che suddenly asked, "Senior God Venerable, there's something I've always wanted to ask, but never dared to."

Meng Kongchan chuckled, "Between us, father and son, there's nothing that can't be said."

"What I want to ask is..."

Yun Che's gaze showed a hint of worry and apprehension: "If the best outcome is achieved, then how will your relationship with God Venerable Huaxin... and God Venerable Jueluo change?"

Meng Kongchan's faint smile showed a momentary crack.

He didn't prevaricate or try to gloss over it, but instead sighed softly: "Huaxin and I understand Dian Luohou¹³ best. Regardless of the final outcome, it will inevitably create an irreparable rift."

"The best outcome is that while a rift forms between us and Dian Luohou, our friendship still remains. However, this outcome requires sufficient patience and careful groundwork, and Huaxin and I will also have to humble ourselves sufficiently before him. Nevertheless, it is true that Huaxin and I were at fault first, and we should do this; Dian Luohou deserves it from us."

"The ordinary outcome is that our friendship with Dian Luohou dissipates, leaving only indifference. Given Dian Luohou's unyielding nature... this is also the most likely outcome Huaxin and I foresee."

After a brief pause, he continued, "The difference between these two outcomes only concerns the friendship among the three of us. But you and Caili can then be together without any further obstacles, working hand in hand without hindrance... both are excellent outcomes."

Yun Che's face showed emotion, his gaze lowered, and his voice became much softer: "The friendship among you three God Venerables spans over ten thousand years, how precious it is, yet for Caili and me..."

"Hahahaha!"

Meng Kongchan burst into laughter, interrupting his words filled with guilt: "Yuan'er, you and Caili love each other, have gone through life and death together, both possess perfect divine cores, and are both descendants of God Venerables. In the entire history of the Abyss, I doubt there's a 'match made in heaven' like you two."

"And the most important point..."

He reached out and gently placed a hand on Yun Che's shoulder: "You are my son, Yuan'er. When it concerns your future and your life, anything your father does for you is right and I do it gladly. Huaxin feels the same way about that girl Caili. You absolutely don't need to feel bothered by this."

"You'll understand this feeling when you become a father yourself someday."

Yun Che's lips quivered, and after a long while, he softly asked, "Then... what about the worst-case scenario?"

Meng Kongchan's smile gradually faded, and his gaze turned towards the empty distance: "If we were to have a direct showdown, the consequence would certainly be a complete severing of ties. What kind of repercussions his fury would unleash is hard to predict."

"And an even worse outcome would be if Dian Luohou were to learn of it prematurely from elsewhere, before we've had enough time for guidance, groundwork, buffering, and compensation... In his eyes, that would be a complete deception, concealment, betrayal, and even humiliation from Huaxin and me towards him."

He slowly closed his eyes: "The consequences then would not be as simple as just anger; there would likely be hatred... bone-deep hatred."

"For the loyal, he would die for them; for traitors, his hatred would surpass that for his enemies, wishing them to suffer rather than die."

Yun Che whispered, "The rumored temperament of God Venerable Jueluo... is indeed as Senior God Venerable described."

Noticing Yun Che's worry and apprehension, Meng Kongchan withdrew his gaze, and his expression relaxed: "Heh heh, this is also why Huaxin and I have visited the Senluo Divine Nation¹⁴ multiple times over the past few years, while you and Caili could not meet. However, you can rest assured; Huaxin and I have made multiple plans, and as long as no major accidents occur, that so-called worst outcome is unlikely to happen."

"It's just that you and Caili must control yourselves as much as possible. After this Pure Land Assembly, you will still have to return to your respective divine nations and must not meet easily before the dust settles. But I imagine someone as intelligent and rational as you doesn't need me to remind you of this."

"Furthermore, before leaving the Pure Land, Huaxin and I will take you and Caili to privately meet the Abyss Emperor."

Yun Che looked surprised: "Take Caili and me?"

Yun Che had fully expected that Meng Kongchan and Huaxin would quietly go to meet the Abyss Emperor during this trip to the Pure Land to confess his and Hua Caili's matter to him beforehand. However, he hadn't expected that they would bring him and Hua Caili along.

"Yes."

Meng Kongchan nodded: "Huaxin and I made this decision a year ago. As for the reason..."

"A small part of the reason is that the Abyss Emperor dotes on Caili greatly; when facing him directly, he might calm down a bit of his anger out of reluctance to upset her. The larger part of the reason..."

At this point, his eyes held a smile: "Huaxin and I both feel that you might have the ability to win some favor from the Abyss Emperor."

"This..."

Yun Che humbly said, "The Abyss Emperor is such a figure; you're truly overestimating me."

"Hahahaha!!"

Meng Kongchan laughed loudly: "That girl Caili is so obedient, never overstepping boundaries, yet for you, she broke off her engagement and even dared to contend with her father, whom she never defied; Jianxi is someone I watched grow up, and I know his capabilities well, yet you completely subdued him in such a short time."

"Your capabilities are probably far greater than we imagined, hahahaha!" Amidst his laughter, Meng Kongchan had already led Yun Che back to the courtyard. Yun Che did not go out again, but honestly remained by Meng Kongchan's side, quietly meditating and concentrating, awaiting the moment to meet the Abyss Emperor. As his five senses withdrew, the outside world completely fell silent, leaving only countless strands of thought constantly intertwining and calculating various possibilities within his soul sea.

Until a certain moment, a surge of profound energy¹⁵ descended from the distant sky, accompanied by a dull, majestic hum. Throughout the Weaving Dream Divine Nation¹⁶, everyone opened their eyes, stood up, and assumed a solemn demeanor.

"Brother Yuan, the time has come."

Meng Jianxi's voice sounded in his ear. Yun Che stood up, his face displaying the most appropriate expressions of nervousness, anticipation, and excitement.

"No need to be nervous, just act as usual."

After transmitting a message to Yun Che, Meng Kongchan stood proudly, a divine pressure belonging to a True God surging around him: "The time has come! To Eden Cloud Peak¹⁷!"

————Undoubtedly, the Pure Land was the purest place in the Abyss World. And this place was the ultimate purity of the Pure Land. The color was pure, unblemished white; clouds were underfoot, and the sky was connected to the clouds. As far as the eye could see, apart from the figures from outside, there wasn't a single trace of impurity or flaw.

The aura, moreover, felt as if it had been cleansed by the purest, most immaculate spring water in the world, devoid of the abyss dust of the mist sea, and even the mortal dust of the secular world. Even in the God Realm¹⁸, which Yun Che was most familiar with, such a pure place barely existed. This place was named — Eden Cloud Peak.

It was the highest point of the Pure Land, the supreme land of the Abyss. It was also the residence of the Abyss Emperor. Beyond the layers of clouds lay the place of audience revered by the entire world, which even the God Venerables of the Six Nations dared not look upon directly — the Eden Holy Temple¹⁹.

"What a strange place, its purity makes one uncomfortable." This was actually the evaluation given by the Life Creation God²⁰, who symbolized the ultimate sanctity of the world.

Yun Che, whose contemplation had been interrupted, replied, "Such a space is clearly not naturally formed. Creating such extreme purity and immaculateness... it's as if it reflects a certain obsession in one's heart."

"Obsession?" Lisuo²¹ asked, puzzled.

"This... it's hard to explain clearly to you right now. For now, I need to focus on dealing with this important matter." His gaze swept forward, meeting one gaze after another. Soon, the core forces of the Six Great Divine Nations and the only surviving beast race, the Dragon Clan, would gather here. However, none of these beings who ruled the Abyss World and stood at its apex knew that among them, deeply hidden, was a demon god who had sworn to destroy the Abyss at all costs.
