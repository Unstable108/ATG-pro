"It's a little strange. Why did she agree to fight? It's a battle she's destined to lose, and after what happened with Meng Jianxi, I can't see any point in her accepting." Li Suo voiced her confusion.

Yun Che's lips curved slightly as he sidestepped the question. "To a certain extent, Caili's Heaven-Shattering Sword Intent actually counters... or rather, it isn't particularly intimidated by the Exquisite Profound Realm. But with the addition of Glazed Ice, Caili has no chance of victory."

He gazed at the two women facing each other within the battlefield barrier, his heart a tangle of indescribable complexity. One in black, one in white. One was as cold and aloof as an immortal of the frozen moon; the other, as ethereal and exquisitely beautiful as an epiphyllum¹ from an ancient painting. Perhaps in the eyes of the world, to win the favor of either one would be the greatest fortune a man could ever hope for, an absurd fantasy that countless souls wouldn't even dare to dream of. Yet no one knew—not even Shen Wuyi and Hua Caili themselves, who were facing each other for the first time—that one was his lawfully wedded wife, and the other had devoted her body and soul to him, her heart unwavering for this lifetime.

Yun Che forcefully dispelled the tangled thoughts in his mind and said with focus, "This battle is destined to be short. Next..."

"It will be my turn." He wasn't worried that Shen Wuyi would be heavy-handed with Hua Caili. After all, the Illuminationless Divine Sovereign's malice had only ever been directed at men.

"You?"

Li Suo was puzzled. "Although you've made a name for yourself in the Abyss, you are not, after all, a God Child of Dream Weaving. On what grounds will you participate in this Battle of the God Children?"

"Besides, why would you want to... fight her?"

"You're overthinking it. Of course, I'm not fighting her."

From the corner of his eye, Yun Che's gaze silently brushed past the Abyss Monarch's location for a moment.

"I have experienced true loneliness before—that terrifying feeling of having people by your side, yet feeling utterly empty inside. And the Abyss Monarch... the loneliness he has endured is likely countless times heavier than what I suffered back then."

"It's like walking alone through an endless night, year after year, for a million years... If a brilliant light that tears through that loneliness were to suddenly appear in this endless night, he would never be able to ignore it or remain silent."

Li Suo seemed lost in thought.

"Shen Wuyi of the Eternal Night Divine Nation, cultivation at level six of the Divine Extinction Realm. Hua Caili of the Heaven-Shattering Divine Nation, cultivation at level two of the Divine Extinction Realm. For this battle, Shen Wuyi must be granted the Profound Desolation Seal to balance her profound energy realm to match Hua Caili's." The Grand Divine Official's palm once again shone with that bronze profound light. The light shot out, passed through the barrier, and landed on Shen Wuyi.

The moment it made contact, the profound light inexplicably paused for an instant, causing the Grand Divine Official's brows to furrow slightly. But this pause was so fleeting it was almost imperceptible. It then bloomed upon Shen Wuyi's body, forming a small sealing formation before quietly vanishing. Instantly, Shen Wuyi's profound energy aura weakened rapidly. In just three short breaths, it had plummeted to level two of the Divine Extinction Realm, achieving a near-perfect balance with the profound energy Hua Caili was releasing.

"Begin!" With a clear cry of a sword, the Glazed Cloud Sword was unsheathed. A sword glow like flowing fireflies poured forth, reflecting upon Hua Caili. In that same instant, the young girl's entire demeanor changed.

The faint trace of childishness in her eyes vanished, and her spirit-clear, moon-like pupils sharpened into cold stars that one hardly dared to meet directly. Her figure remained slender and delicate, yet it was now wreathed in a formidable sword intent that warned all things to keep their distance. Her snow-white, cloud-like robes danced without wind, and the Seven Luminaries Sword Crest² and the Star God Crest on her skirt flowed with her sword intent, bursting with fine, brilliant light. At that moment, everyone present felt a strange sense of恍惚... The Heaven-Shattering Divine Maiden, who in their memories was as beautiful as a celestial star but had yet to fully mature, now faintly possessed the bearing of the Sword Immortal, Hua Qingying.

"..." The light in the Abyss Monarch's eyes shifted slightly for a moment.

Shen Wuyi raised her hand, pointing her Heartless Sword diagonally toward the ground, but she neither released an attack nor condensed her Glazed Ice, clearly intending for Hua Caili to strike first.

The sword intent in Hua Caili's eyes had already condensed into soul-piercing cold stars. The fingers gripping her sword were long and fair, and the aura coiling around them had seamlessly merged with the glow of the Glazed Cloud Sword, spreading out to form an invisible field of pure, transcendent energy.

Seven pale white sword lights circled silently around her... More than half the people present hadn't even noticed when these seven sword lights had formed.

Hua Caili raised her gaze slightly. Where her eyes fell, it was as if the very air was being sliced by her sword's presence, creating faint ripples. Without any visible movement or change in her aura, one of the sword lights shot out, trailing a thin white streak as it stabbed directly at Shen Wuyi.

Shen Wuyi didn't move. The sword light passed through her body... and then suddenly froze the instant it did. The afterimage dissipated, and Shen Wuyi's true form appeared to Hua Caili's left... close enough to touch. A spatial shift of the Exquisite Profound Realm!

But, in the very instant Shen Wuyi's true form appeared, a sword light abruptly filled her vision, barely half a foot from her brow. It was an unpredictable, instantaneous spatial shift that should have made it impossible for her opponent to re-lock onto her with spiritual sense. Yet this sword light seemed to have been lying in wait, striking almost simultaneously with her appearance.

At such a close distance, the sudden sword light caught Shen Wuyi off guard. With no way to evade, she could only execute a second spatial shift.

Swish!!

The sword light struck empty air, leaving behind a pale white gash that lingered for a long time. Shen Wuyi's true form appeared above and to the right of Hua Caili... and just as she appeared, two sword lights converged on her from the left and right.

With no time to build her sword's momentum, Shen Wuyi barely managed to twist her body. Both sword lights grazed past her, but two more immediately followed... The two that had just missed also turned sharply, attacking from behind. Two in front, two in back, sealing all her escape routes.

Screech—

Shen Wuyi's afterimage shattered as all four sword lights missed, leaving only the piercing sound of tearing air. A thousand feet away, Shen Wuyi's true form materialized. She glanced sideways at her right arm.

A gash several inches long had been torn in the black fabric on her right shoulder, revealing jade-like skin as white as snow and a bleeding sword wound.

A brief silence was followed by an uproar.

No one had expected that in the very first exchange between the two women, it would be Shen Wuyi who was injured. Even Dian Jiuzhi, until his defeat, had failed to inflict so much as an external wound on her.

"Could that be... the legendary Heaven-Shattering Sword Intent?"

Meng Jianxi said with no small amount of surprise, "I heard that three years ago, when the Heaven-Shattering Divine Maiden finished her training, she not only broke through to a new realm but also comprehended the Heaven-Shattering Sword Intent. But Uncle was convinced it was a baseless rumor, because not even Senior Sword Immortal was able to grasp the Heaven-Shattering Sword at that age."

"I never thought... not only is it true, but it seems... she wields it so naturally and skillfully. It doesn't look like she's just scratched the surface at all."

"..." Yun Che watched the barrier without a word.

Meng Kongchan said faintly, "The world only knows that the Heaven-Shattering Sword Intent of the Heaven-Shattering Divine Nation can make an opponent's profound energy as brittle as thin paper, easily shattered. But few know that the greatest strength of the Heaven-Shattering Sword Intent is that the sword lights it condenses possess their own spiritual sense."

As someone who had fought Hua Fuchen many times, Meng Kongchan was naturally one of the people in the world who understood the Heaven-Shattering Sword Intent best. "Ordinary profound practitioners perceive their enemies with spiritual sense, but the Heaven-Shattering Sword's spiritual sense pursues the heart and locks onto the soul... This outcome was to be expected."

The seven sword lights had all returned to circle around Hua Caili. She hadn't moved an inch, yet the hearts of every profound practitioner present trembled. As people of the Six Divine Nations, none could forget the shocking evaluation the cold and strict Grand Divine Official had once given Hua Qingying... the greatest sword talent in the history of the Six Divine Nations, and the only person in the current era who could potentially achieve the realm of a True God on her own, without an inheritance. Even such a peerless Sword Immortal had taken seventy-seven years to comprehend the first wisp of Heaven-Shattering Sword Intent.

And Hua Caili...

Ding!

A soft chime, carrying a bone-chilling cold that instantly dispelled the stray thoughts in everyone's minds, rang out. A faint icy glow had condensed on Shen Wuyi's Heartless Sword, and around her, that bizarre, almost demonic Glazed Barrier had appeared. Even when facing Dian Jiuzhi, she had not condensed her Glazed Ice this early.

The clamor died down completely. Everyone held their breath, waiting to see if the Heaven-Shattering Divine Maiden's sword intent, at the same cultivation level, could sever the Glazed Barrier that Dian Jiuzhi couldn't break even with a two-level advantage.

But Hua Caili spoke softly, "I am not your match."

Her words sounded like a concession, but her voice was as crisp as a mountain spring, without a trace of shame or weakness. On the contrary, her expression and aura suddenly surged with an intense resolve... one that bordered on desperation.

"My only chance of victory... lies in a single strike!"

"If you can withstand this sword, I will concede."

Zheng... Zheng!!

The Glazed Cloud Sword suddenly began to tremble, letting out a series of slightly frenzied hums. Hua Fuchen's gaze solidified. He was about to witness the great surprise Hua Caili had prepared for him... the Third Sword of Heaven Shattering she had comprehended in the Seven Stars Heaven-Shattering Formation. What magnificent splendor would it unleash in her hands?

Shen Wuyi remained expressionless and did not attack immediately.

Zheng!!!

The Glazed Cloud Sword trembled violently, emitting a heavy clang powerful enough to shatter stone. Hua Caili's snowy face tensed, and the sword light in her eyes flared like an exploding star, tinged with a finality that seemed capable of extinguishing all things. The profound energy and sword qi around her began to roil. Her snow-white robes whipped about, and the Seven Luminaries Sword Crest and Star God Crest on her skirt all lit up with an unusual glow, flashing in and out of existence, their brilliance carrying a faint sense of unease.

"...?!?" Shen Wuyi's brow suddenly furrowed. She felt as if a sword was pressed against her heart and soul, carrying an indescribable, almost absurd soul-binding sensation. It made her feel, inexplicably yet with absolute clarity, that under this sword, her heart was pursued and her soul was locked; there was nowhere to run. And with every breath, this sword's edge grew more intense, its power skyrocketing with every passing moment, gradually growing so strong that a deepening chill began to bloom in her heart and soul.

She raised her sword horizontally, and layers upon layers of Glazed Ice rapidly condensed upon the Heartless Sword.

"...?" Hua Qingying's brow furrowed in confusion, and then her expression changed drastically.

"Caili, stop!!" This sudden, alarmed cry made everyone turn their heads, only to see that it was the Sword Immortal, Hua Qingying.

A streak of azure light flashed, and Hua Qingying was already before the battlefield barrier, her voice filled with an urgency that was foreign to all who knew her. "Caili, don't be willful! Stop at once! Caili!!"

Everyone stared, stunned. Those who knew the Sword Immortal's name also knew that Hua Caili was her sole vulnerability. The only thing that could make her, a woman who had been as aloof as a distant immortal her entire life, lose her composure like this was Hua Caili's safety.

Hua Fuchen had also realized something. He too forgot his surroundings, instantly appearing beside Hua Qingying, his pupils constricting rapidly as Hua Caili's sword light intensified.

That was not the momentum of the Third Sword of Heaven Shattering. It was clearly... the Fourth Sword of Heaven Shattering!

If they were outside the battlefield, he would have been overjoyed to learn that Hua Caili had already gained a preliminary understanding of the Fourth Sword. But right now, sensing the turbulence of her sword aura and the abnormal ferocity of her sword intent, he felt only terror. She had not yet mastered the Fourth Sword; otherwise, she would have excitedly told Hua Qingying long ago. Furthermore, the power of the Fourth Sword required an immense expenditure of profound energy. With her cultivation at only level two of the Divine Extinction Realm, even a single strike was a great strain. To forcibly unleash it would inflict ten parts of damage on the enemy at the cost of twelve to herself!

Hua Caili did not react to her aunt's shouts... It wasn't that she was turning a deaf ear, but that her heart, will, and soul were all focused on her sword intent, with no spare capacity for anything else.

The Grand Divine Official looked up. An incomparably powerful barrier instantly appeared before Hua Qingying and Hua Fuchen, and his inviolable warning rang across the summit of Eden. "Stand down! No one is to interfere with the battlefield!"

The white light radiating from the Glazed Cloud Sword grew ever more brilliant, gradually giving off specks of shattered, crystalline white light, which then gathered into a sky full of star-like motes resembling fireflies. The motes of light, driven by the ferocious sword aura, slowly and arduously converged... gradually forming a seven-foot-long, pale white sword beam³ on the Glazed Cloud Sword.

The moment the sword beam formed, the surrounding space twisted violently, and then fine cracks rapidly began to appear.

This scene made the crowd of profound practitioners gasp. The space at the summit of Eden was incredibly resilient, yet Hua Caili, with the profound energy of a level-two Divine Extinction Realm cultivator, had created visible spatial tears. One could only imagine how the power of this sword strike had completely transcended the limits of her realm.

But the horrified expressions of Hua Fuchen and Hua Qingying made it clear even to the most ignorant observer... although Hua Caili's attack was terrifyingly powerful, the moment she unleashed it, she would surely pay a heavy price. Their hearts shook, and they were filled with confusion... In past Pure Land Assemblies, the Heaven-Shattering Divine Maiden had always disliked fighting. Today was her first meeting with Shen Wuyi; there was no possibility of any grudge between them. The Battle of the God Children ultimately only concerned a bit of a divine nation's pride and the Abyss Monarch's promise; it didn't involve any core interests of the divine nations or their inheritors. Why... was she so determined, so desperate?

Dian Jiuzhi's expression was one of ill-concealed panic. He broke free from Dian Sansi's support, his lips parting and closing several times, on the verge of crying out uncontrollably.

"..." Yun Che's face was calm, but his chest was rising and falling with slightly quickened breaths.

Glazed Ice was also rapidly condensing on Shen Wuyi's sword. By the time she pointed the Heartless Sword forward, its slender blade was already adorned with dozens of small, translucent ice lotuses... each releasing a terrifying icy aura that seemed to freeze even one's gaze.

Amidst the chaotic sword light, Hua Caili's beautiful eyes finally opened slowly. Within them was the pure, flawless, translucent light of a young girl, yet also a pure resolve that others could not comprehend. Countless sword lights and sword stars intertwined, breathtakingly beautiful yet carrying a world-destroying chill.

The Glazed Cloud Sword, carrying the sword beam, thrust forward. In that instant, heaven and earth fell silent.

Hua Qingying sighed in anguish... She knew that the moment the sword's power erupted, Hua Caili would be gravely injured. But this was the summit of Eden. She was destined to be unable to stop it. All she could do was wait for the moment the battle concluded and rush to protect her.

Shen Wuyi's sword thrust out at the same instant. Following the straight trajectory of the blade, the ice lotuses bloomed with endless, brilliant, and tragically beautiful ice flowers.

The world fell completely silent. Everyone forgot to breathe. The flow of time itself seemed to slow. In every pair of widened eyes, the figures of the two women were clearly reflected, along with the ever-approaching sword beam and ice flowers... until, at a certain moment, they finally collided and overlapped.

Yet the world remained deathly still. There was no explosion of ice crystals, no severing of space by the sword beam, not even the slightest sound of profound energy tearing through the air.

Between Hua Caili and Shen Wuyi, a white figure had appeared.

His hands were outstretched. His left hand reached out, a single finger touching the Glazed Cloud Sword, while his right hand's finger tapped the Heartless Sword... The sword beam and the ice flowers, along with all the profound energy they had released, vanished completely.

It was as if they had been instantly erased from existence by an unseen hand, leaving not a single trace of their obliteration.
