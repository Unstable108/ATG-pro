Yun Che was in a terrible state. To crush Dian Sansi in a single instant and shatter his spirit with the most humiliating defeat possible, he had been forced to activate God's Embers for a fleeting moment. Though it lasted but an instant, the immense strain caused his vision to go black, nearly snapping his bones and tendons. A surge of blood rushed up his throat, but he forced it back down.

But when Dian Sansi's crazed roars echoed across the entire venue, even the searing pain in his body became strangely gratifying. The first, most crucial piece in this grand chess game of the Abyss had finally been placed.

It was as if a great cauldron had descended from the sky, instantly extinguishing the chaotic tide of astonished cries.

The expression on every face froze solid. Eden Cloud Top fell into a dreadful, oppressive silence, with only the swirling clouds carrying the fading, hoarse echoes of Dian Sansi's voice.

Meng Kongchan and Hua Fuchen, both True Gods, possessed immensely powerful souls, yet at this moment, their minds reeled with shock. They could only struggle to maintain a calm facade.

Dian Luohou's raised hand froze in mid-air. Then, he whipped his head around, his gaze turning fierce as he swung his palm.

Slap!!

A vicious slap sent Dian Sansi—his most favored son after Dian Jiuzhi—flying dozens of yards away in front of the entire crowd, accompanied by a furious roar: "You bastard! How dare you utter such beastly words!"

From the side of the Heaven Breaker Divine Kingdom, the head of the Seven Sword Sovereigns—the Tianshu Sword Sovereign¹—roared in anger, "Utterly preposterous! You Senluo brat, how dare you slander the Divine Maiden of my Heaven Breaker Divine Kingdom in such a manner!"

The Yaoguang Sword Sovereign² chimed in furiously, "The name Meng Jian Yuan was restored a mere three years ago, and for these three years, Caili has remained within the Seven Star Heaven Breaker Formation without leaving for even a moment! How could there be any 'illicit affair'? Senluo brat, this is the Pure Land! How dare you make such slanderous accusations! If you do not give us a proper explanation, we of Heaven Breaker will not let this matter rest!"

"That's right!" Meng Zangji, the Grand Hall Master of the Dream Weaver Divine Kingdom, declared in a deep voice. "Since his return, Meng Jian Yuan has remained within our divine domain. Before arriving at the Pure Land, aside from personally escorting Pan Buwang out of our territory, he never once took a single step outside. Countless people in our divine domain can attest to this! When would he have had the opportunity for this so-called 'illicit affair' of yours?"

"Such a ridiculous claim is not only absurd but also falls apart with the slightest scrutiny. It is the greatest joke under the heavens!"

The sharp pain on his face, the rebukes ringing in his ears, and the endless humiliation did nothing to calm Dian Sansi. Instead, they fueled his madness. Sprawled on the ground, he let out a roar that nearly tore his throat apart. "I'm not lying! Outside the Spirit Immortal Divine Official's residence, I saw it with my own eyes—"

His following words were cut short as a hand clamped down hard over his mouth. Dian Jiuzhi had thrown himself on top of him, his right hand gripping his jaw so tightly that his trembling fingers warped, nearly crushing Dian Sansi's mandible.

"Shut up... Shut up!" he roared. But his only response was the prolonged, deathly silence around him.

Suddenly, as if waking from a dream, his fingers went limp. He froze, his soul seemingly having fled his body. As Hua Caili's betrothed, he should have been more desperate than anyone to know the truth, and this was absolutely not how he should have reacted. His frantic attempt to silence his brother did not conceal anything... On the contrary, it was a self-defeating confirmation.

Dian Luohou's fury froze on his face. He stared at Dian Sansi, then at Dian Jiuzhi, and his lion-like beard began to tremble violently.

Dian Sansi crawled forward. Now that the words were out, he no longer needed to hold back. The long-suppressed rage, humiliation, and resentment in his chest erupted with his voice. "Abyssal Emperor... Father God... It wasn't just me... Brother Jiuzhi saw it with his own eyes too!"

"Brother Jiuzhi's engagement to the Heaven Breaker Divine Maiden was personally bestowed by the Abyssal Emperor... The whole world knows this! Yun Che's actions... are a contemptuous disregard for the Abyssal Emperor! A disregard for the Pure Land! An insult to us of Senluo! How can such a shameless and despicable person be worthy of the Abyssal Emperor's praise... worthy of standing upon this Pure Land!"

"If a single word of this is false, may I be devoured and annihilated by the Abyssal Dust... cast out by heaven and man alike..."

"Cough... cough, cough, cough..."

Dian Sansi's throat was completely shredded, and he coughed up mouthfuls of scorched blood. But this time, Dian Luohou did not stop his screaming. Aside from Dian Sansi's pained, bloody coughs, the surroundings remained silent for a long time... This matter concerned the Senluo, Heaven Breaker, and Dream Weaver kingdoms, and more importantly, the Abyssal Emperor. They knew all too well the immense repercussions if this were true. Who would dare to speak rashly?

Even the Sword Sovereigns of the Heaven Breaker Divine Kingdom and the Soul Hall Masters of the Dream Weaver Divine Kingdom suddenly fell silent, no one uttering another rebuke for a long while. They had all noticed the Divine Sovereign's strange reaction. The anger on their faces gradually morphed into a terrifying unease in the dreadful silence.

Dian Luohou's head turned, but the movement was so stiff and sluggish it was like that of a stooped old man with a broken neck.

It took several full breaths, his neck seeming to catch and jerk multiple times, before his gaze finally shifted toward the Heaven Breaker Divine Kingdom. The first person he looked at was not Hua Fuchen, but Hua Caili.

Such a drastic turn of events, such a shock, was far beyond what Hua Caili's mental defenses could bear. Although Hua Qingying shielded her, the small part of her face that was visible was a deathly, sickly pale.

His gaze shifted again, landing on Hua Fuchen. This man, his childhood friend and closest confidant, avoided his eyes, his face contorting in a pained and conflicted grimace.

"Brother Fuchen," Dian Luohou began, his voice seemingly calm as usual, though tinged with a slight hoarseness. "This matter... is it true, or false?"

Dian Luohou was known for his fiery temper, yet at this moment, he was so calm. He suppressed his emotions with such force because he, more than anyone, hoped it was all false. He, more than anyone, wanted Hua Fuchen to give him a denial.

Hua Fuchen's mouth opened, and with great difficulty, he finally managed to speak. "Old Dian, this matter..."

"Tell me, is it true, or false!" Dian Luohou's voice rose, laced with extreme restraint, yet it still carried a soul-shaking fury.

Hua Fuchen tilted his head back and closed his eyes. Things had come to this; any attempt to hide the truth was futile.

"...True."

BOOM—

That single word was as shocking as a thunderclap. It was like a ten-thousand-ton boulder had been dropped into a dead-still lake. The ensuing gasps of shock were deafening, and the expressions on everyone's faces became... absolutely spectacular.

"Your Holiness... This... this..." The Seven Sword Sovereigns of Heaven Breaker, along with everyone else from their divine kingdom, were utterly stunned. The members of Dream Weaver were equally dumbfounded. They looked from Meng Kongchan to Yun Che, who still stood in the center of the battlefield, their expressions and emotions more complex than they had ever experienced in their lives.

Meng Jianxi took two steps forward to stand beside Meng Kongchan, trying his best to regulate his breathing. Before they had arrived at the Pure Land, when the profound warships of the two kingdoms had met, such a guess had crossed his mind. But the speculation was so terrifying and absurd that he had instantly crushed it. He never imagined that it was actually... But when did all this happen? What was the opportunity? What was the reason...

"Alas, this is truly... an unexpected drama," Wu Shenxing sighed deeply.

Wu Shenyue said, "In that case... I fear the unbreakable alliance between Senluo, Heaven Breaker, and Dream Weaver is about to collapse overnight."

"No, it may be even more serious," Wu Shenxing replied. "All of this erupted here, in the Pure Land, right under the Abyssal Emperor's watch."

"So that means..." Wu Shenyue's eyes narrowed with a strange light. "The Heaven Breaker Divine Maiden's reckless sword strike earlier wasn't to vent Dian Jiuzhi's anger at all. It was... an attempt to use the boon granted by the Abyssal Emperor to annul her engagement to Dian Jiuzhi."

"A pity... she was too late." After speaking, he shook his head and repeated those two words, "A pity..."

"Hahahaha! Hahahahahaha!" Shen Wuyanye let out a wild laugh, laughing so hard her entire palanquin trembled. "So this is love between a man and a woman... How filthy... how pathetic... Hahahaha... A joke... What a colossal joke... Hahahaha!"

She laughed uncontrollably, even more wildly than when Shen Wuwang had swept Dian Jiuzhi aside... but the end of her laughter seemed to carry a faint trace of sorrow.

Yun Che stood motionless, his face deathly pale from forcibly activating God's Embers... but in the eyes of others, it undoubtedly looked like a state of immense terror.

Dian Luohou's gaze now turned to Meng Kongchan. He seemed to be searching for confusion, for anger on Meng Kongchan's face... but there was none. There was only the same pained struggle as Hua Fuchen.

"So," he began, "you... also knew all along?"

All eyes fell upon Meng Kongchan.

"Yes," he answered.

The color drained from Dian Luohou's face at a terrifying speed. The muscles on his face twitched, and his lion-like body swayed, on the verge of collapse several times.

"Heh... heheh..." He began to laugh, a particularly hoarse sound, which then grew into a loud, wild laugh... "Haha... hahaha... Hahahahahaha!"

His laughter was as thunderous as ever, but it no longer held a trace of its usual might and boldness. Instead, it was filled with a bone-chilling sorrow.

Hua Fuchen's hands clenched tightly as he spoke in a pained voice, "Old Dian..."

"Shut up!" A heaven-shaking roar drowned out Hua Fuchen's voice. "Are you worthy of calling me 'Old Dian'?! Are you?! Are you?!"

Dian Luohou's pupils were as red as blood, his eyes filled with countless shocking, crimson veins. Hua Fuchen's lips moved, but he closed his eyes again in pain. He and Meng Kongchan had envisioned many possible outcomes, good and bad... and the worst of them was Dian Luohou finding out before all the groundwork had been laid.

To avoid this disastrous outcome, Yun Che and Hua Caili had stayed in their respective kingdoms for the past few years, unable to meet. After the gathering in the Pure Land, no matter how reluctant they were, they would have had to separate by force. But they never expected such a lapse to occur during this brief meeting.

Even more unexpected... the situation was a thousand, a hundred thousand times worse than the worst outcome they had imagined.

If Dian Luohou had found out in private, he would have been furious, but he would have absolutely suppressed the news to preserve the dignity of the Senluo Divine Kingdom and its Divine Son, Dian Jiuzhi, to the greatest extent possible. What followed would have been a matter between the three of them and their divine kingdoms.

But now... this was all being exposed so suddenly, with the six kingdoms and the Dragon Clan present, and right in front of the Abyssal Emperor and the Grand Divine Official. What was inflicted upon Dian Luohou was betrayal and humiliation magnified to the absolute extreme.

"Hua Fuchen, Meng Kongchan!" He called out the names of his once-closest friends, each word a mournful, teeth-grinding cry. "One has a daughter who betrayed my son's love, the other has a son who stole my son's wife!"

"You both knew... You both knew!! Yet not only did you not stop it, you treated me like a stupid pig, played me like a clay dog! Hehe... hahahaha... You truly are my good brothers, my good brothers! Hahahahaha!"

Dian Luohou had lived a glorious life. He was born into nobility, his innate divine constitution making him the Senluo Divine Son, unmatched by any man of his generation. After succeeding as the Divine Sovereign, he became the most powerful of the six Divine Sovereigns, his might shaking the Abyss, the number one figure beneath the Pure Land.

But his greatest pride in life was not the title of First Divine Sovereign, but the two closest friends he had made in his youth, who eventually became Divine Sovereigns alongside him. Such a friendship, so close and intertwined, a shared destiny that persisted even after they became sovereigns—how precious, how incredible it was.

And yet, it was these two very people who had dealt him the greatest betrayal and humiliation of his life.

Hua Caili clutched Hua Qingying's robes tightly, her eyes blurred with tears of panic. She bit her lip, not daring to look at her father's eyes, only letting out repeated, soft sobs. "Father... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."

Touring the Pure Land with Yun Che was something she had initiated, unable to suppress her longing for him. They had maintained their distance and restraint the entire time, except for that brief, uncontrollable moment of a few breaths before the Spirit Immortal Divine Residence...

Hua Qingying raised a hand to protect her, comforting her softly, "What's done is done. There's no need to blame yourself."

"Hua Caili!!" Dian Luohou's furious roar was directed straight at her. He pointed at Hua Caili, his fingertip trembling violently. "What a Heaven Breaker Divine Maiden, what a daughter of Hua Fuchen! The depth of my son Jiuzhi's love for you, how well he treated you, the whole world knows, and the heavens can see!"

"For you, he did not let a single woman near him for a full fifty-two sixty-year cycles! For you, he swore that even as the Senluo Divine Sovereign, he would have only you in his life! And for you..."

"Father God." Dian Jiuzhi walked over and gently pressed down Dian Luohou's outstretched hand. "I know Father God must be furious right now, but... please listen to your son for a moment."

He took a deep breath and said in the calmest, most sincere voice he could muster, "Actually, Caili and I had already mutually broken off our engagement long ago."

Hua Fuchen and Meng Kongchan both turned their heads, their expressions stunned.

"..." Dian Luohou slowly turned his gaze. "What did you say!?"

Facing Dian Luohou's unprecedentedly terrifying gaze, Dian Jiuzhi remained composed. "I once thought that what I felt for Caili was romantic love. But as time passed, I suddenly realized one day that my feelings for her were actually the brotherly affection we formed in our youth."

"And Caili is innocent and pure; she never knew what romantic love was. She simply, in her ignorance, obeyed the engagement arranged for her by the Huaxin Divine Sovereign. Therefore, both Caili and I have long wished to end this engagement, but we never had the chance to say so."

"This gathering in the Pure Land, before the Abyssal Emperor, would have been the most appropriate time, but we never expected..."

SLAP!!!!

An incredibly heavy slap landed viciously on Dian Jiuzhi's face. The horrifying crack made it clear that his cheekbone had been shattered. Dian Jiuzhi was sent tumbling to the ground, his body convulsing in pain.

The Senluo elders were aghast and rushed forward. "Your Holiness, calm your anger..."

"Get lost!" Dian Luohou roared, and everyone who approached was violently blasted away, spitting blood.

Under everyone's horrified gazes, Dian Luohou walked over to the collapsed Dian Jiuzhi, his eyes filled with a terrifyingly sinister gloom. "I have always been strict with you, but I have never struck you before. Do you know why I did today!?"

Dian Jiuzhi opened his mouth, but only a gush of bloody foam came out.

"Do you believe your own words?! Are you taking me for a fool, or are you taking the Abyssal Emperor and the entire world for fools!"

"I... I..." Dian Jiuzhi dared not rise, let alone look up.

"Tell me," Dian Luohou's chest heaved as if it would burst, "what is a man's greatest hatred, and what is a man's greatest humiliation!"

Dian Jiuzhi's gaze was unfocused as he struggled to speak. "A man's greatest hatred is the murder of his father; a man's greatest humiliation is... having his wife stolen."

"Heh... heheh..." Dian Luohou let out a sad and furious sneer. "Do you know that from this day forward, everyone in this world will know that you, the dignified Senluo Divine Son, had your betrothed stolen from you!"

"Everyone will mock you, pity you! Even the lowliest person in this world can use you as gossip, as a colossal joke!"

"Even if you become the Divine Sovereign in the future, even if your future achievements surpass mine tenfold, this brand of shame will always exist, never to fade! When anyone sees you, the first thing they will think of is that you are a pathetic wretch whose wife was stolen... and the Senluo Divine Kingdom will be shamed along with you!"

"And that Yun Che... even if he amounts to nothing in the future, you will forever be the loser in his presence, forever a joke, do you understand?! Do you understand!!"

Dian Jiuzhi buried his head deep, his breathing ragged and heavy.

"And yet, you are still trying to make excuses for them, still trying to defend them! I... Heh, I, Dian Luohou, am a joke, and my son is an even bigger joke... Hahahaha, hahahahaha!"

"Old Dian..." Meng Kongchan could no longer remain silent and spoke with difficulty. "You are not a joke. The fault lies with us..."

Dian Luohou whipped his head around, his terrifying gaze like poison-laced steel needles, stabbing Meng Kongchan into silence.

"Meng Kongchan, Hua Fuchen," his gaze trembled, his lips parted, every word laced with sorrow. "What did I, Dian Luohou, ever do wrong? In what way did I ever fail you, for you to treat me like this..."

Meng Kongchan and Hua Fuchen's lips moved, but neither could find the words to reply, nor could they find it in themselves to face him.

BOOM!!!

With an explosive sound, Dian Luohou's figure appeared before Hua Fuchen, his terrifying aura instantly forcing the Seven Sword Sovereigns back. He shot out a hand, grabbing Hua Fuchen's collar and hauling his Divine Sovereign's body off the ground. His enraged eyes looked ready to burst. "What did I do wrong for you to treat me like this... Speak! Speak!!"

Hua Fuchen did not resist in the slightest, allowing Dian Luohou's furious aura to seep into his flesh and bones, his heart filled with nothing but endless guilt and despair.

"Release His Holiness!" the Seven Sword Sovereigns roared in unison, but before they could act, a beam of ancient bronze profound light descended from the sky.

Zheng!

An irresistible force flung Dian Luohou far away. The bronze profound light did not dissipate but remained between Dian Luohou and Hua Fuchen, as if completely isolating the space they occupied.

The Grand Divine Official's judgmental voice rang out at that moment. "Private battles are forbidden in the Pure Land. Divine Sovereign Jue Luo, considering your soul is trapped in an abyss of rage and you did not truly strike, this will not be pursued for now. Reflect and control yourself. Whatever grievances you have, they shall be dealt with after you leave the Pure Land!"

Dian Luohou looked up at the Abyssal Emperor, forcibly suppressing the rage that was about to spiral out of control, but his clenched fists would not stop trembling.

Just then, the Abyssal Emperor's voice echoed across Eden Cloud Top. "Huang, for defying an imperial command, what crime should be bestowed?"

The Grand Divine Official replied impassively, "The Punishment of Huang's Devouring."

"The Punishment of Huang's Devouring."

The moment these four simple words were spoken, the faces of the immeasurably powerful Divine Sovereigns Huaxin and Wumeng instantly lost all color, their features contorting with a terror that should never appear on the face of a Divine Sovereign.

"Donghuang." The Grand Divine Official raised his eyes and commanded, "Apprehend Yun Che and Hua Caili!"
