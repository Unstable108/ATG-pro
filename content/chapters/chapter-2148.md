Yun Che was in a wretched state. In order to crush Dian Sansi in an instant, thereby making his soul thoroughly collapse in the most unsightly posture of defeat, he had no choice but to activate **God Ash** for a split second. Though it was only an instant, the immense load still made his vision go black, his tendons and bones nearly snapping apart; a stream of blood surged up his throat, only to be ruthlessly swallowed back down.
 
But when Dian Sansi's maniacal roar resounded through the entire venue, even the agonizing pain racking his body instantly became immensely gratifying.
 
In this Abyssal chess game, the most crucial piece of the early stage had finally fallen.
 
Like a giant cauldron capping the sky, the development instantly annihilated the tide of exclamations that was surging wildly through the crowd.
 
Everyone's expression froze dead on their faces. Atop Eden's Crown, there was a deathly silence so oppressive it was terrifying; only the clouds rolled with the gradually fading, hoarse echoes of Dian Sansi.
 
How powerful were the True God Divine Souls of Meng Kongchan and Hua Fuchen? Yet at this moment, their minds buzzed with a dull roar, and they could only barely maintain a facade of calmness.
 
Dian Luohou's raised palm froze in mid-air. Then, he jerked his head around, his gaze turning fierce, and lashed out.
 
*PA!!*
 
A vicious slap sent Dian Sansi... this son he loved most besides Dian Jiuzhi, flying over a hundred meters away in public, accompanied by a furious curse: "Bastard thing! You dare utter such beastly words!"
 
Over at the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God, the head of the Seven Sword Sovereigns—Sword Sovereign Tianshu—said angrily: "Simply ridiculous! Boundless brat, how can my Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God's Divine Daughter tolerate such slander from you!"
 
Sword Sovereign Yaoguang followed up in rage: "The name of Meng Jianyuan has only returned for three years. And in these three years, Caili has always been within the Seven Stars Heaven Breaker Formation, never leaving for even half a moment; where does this 'affair' come from! Boundless brat, this is the Pure Land. You dare to utter such slanderous words; if you do not give an explanation, my Heaven Breaker will absolutely not let this go."
 
"Correct!!"
 
Dreamweaver Kingdom of God's Chief Hall Master Meng Cangji said in a deep voice: "Since Meng Jianyuan's return, he has always been within the Divine Region. Before coming to the Pure Land this time, aside from personally sending Pan Buwang out of the Divine Region midway, he has never taken half a step away; countless people in my Divine Region can testify! Where is the opportunity to commit your so-called 'affair'!"
 
"Such absurd words are not only ridiculous but can be pierced with a single poke; it is simply the greatest joke in the world!"
 
The severe pain on his face, the reprimands in his ears, and the endless humiliation did not restore a shred of calm to Dian Sansi, but instead stimulated his madness even more. He lay on the ground, letting out a roar that almost tore his throat: "I didn't! Outside the Ling Xian's Divine Dwelling, I saw with my own eyes..."
 
His subsequent words were ruthlessly crushed by a palm. Dian Jiuzhi pounced on his body, his right hand firmly seizing his jaw; his five trembling fingers gripped with such force they contorted, almost crushing Dian Sansi's jaw.
 
"Shut up... SHUT UP!!" He roared... but what responded to him was a long, deathly silence in his ears.
 
Suddenly, he woke up as if from a dream, weakly loosening his fingers, his entire person frozen there soullessly.
 
As Hua Caili's betrothed, he should have wanted to know the truth or falsehood more than anyone, and absolutely shouldn't have had this reaction. His panicked attempt at prevention not only failed to cover it up... but instead served as evidence that only made it more conspicuous.
 
The rage on Dian Luohou's face froze. He stared at Dian Sansi, stared at Dian Jiuzhi, his lion-like beard clearly beginning to tremble violently.
 
Dian Sansi's body shifted forward; since the words were spoken, he no longer needed to endure. The anger, humiliation, and unwillingness that had been squeezed in his chest for so long vented madly along with his voice: "Abyssal Monarch... Father God... Not only me... Brother Jiuzhi also saw it with his own eyes!"
 
"Brother Jiuzhi's engagement to the Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter was personally bestowed by the Abyssal Monarch... known to all under heaven! Yun Che’s conduct like this... is contempt for the Abyssal Monarch!! Contempt for the Pure Land! Insulting my Boundless! How is such a shameless and despicable person worthy of the Abyssal Monarch's praise... worthy of standing on the Pure Land!"
 
"If there is half a word of falsehood, I am willing to be devoured by abyssal dust... abandoned by heaven and man..."
 
"Cough... *Cough cough cough*..."
 
Dian Sansi's throat tore completely, coughing up large patches of scorched blood.
 
But this time, Dian Luohou did not stop his roaring throughout the entire process.
 
Aside from Dian Sansi's painful coughing sounds, the surroundings remained silent for a long time...
 
It concerned Boundless, Heaven Breaker, Dreamweaver, and even more so the Abyssal Monarch; they knew incomparably well that if this matter were true, the implications would be enormous. Who dared to make a sound lightly?
 
Even the Sword Sovereigns of the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God and the Soul Hall Masters of the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God suddenly fell silent, no one scolding for a long time.
 
Because they all sensed the abnormality in the Divine Regents.
 
The anger on their faces, in this terrible silence, gradually turned into an increasingly terrible unease in their hearts.
 
Dian Luohou's head was turning, but it turned so sluggishly and stiffly, like a hunchbacked old man with a broken neck.
 
It took a full several breaths, a full several jerks of his neck bones, before he turned his gaze toward the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God.
 
In the first instant, his line of sight did not fall on Hua Fuchen, but on Hua Caili.
 
Such a drastic change, such a fright, was simply not something Hua Caili's mental defenses could withstand. Although she was hidden behind Hua Qingying, the sliver of cheek that was revealed was sickly pale.
 
His gaze turned again, looking at Hua Fuchen.
 
This close friend whom he had known since childhood, who was inseparable from him, avoided his gaze; on his face were waves of twitching pain and struggle.
 
"Brother Fuchen,"
 
Dian Luohou spoke; his voice seemed calm as usual, only carrying a hint of hoarseness: "Is this matter... true, or false?"
 
How fiery was Dian Luohou's temperament? Yet at this moment, he was so calm.
 
He suppressed his emotions so strongly because he hoped more than anyone that everything was false, he hoped more than anyone that Hua Fuchen would give him a negative answer.
 
Hua Fuchen opened his mouth, finally emitting an exceptionally difficult voice: "Old Dian, this matter..."
 
"Tell me, TRUE, OR FALSE!" Dian Luohou's voice rose, carrying extreme suppression, yet a rage that still shook the soul.
 
Hua Fuchen looked up and closed his eyes; things had come to this point, trying to conceal it any further was futile.
 
"...True."
 
*Whoosh—*
 
A single word, yet it was earth-shattering.
 
It was as if a ten-thousand-ton boulder had been hurled into a still lake; the gasps that rang out were deafening, and everyone’s expressions became… incredibly vivid.
 
“Your Majesty… this… this…”
 
The Seven Sword Sovereigns of Heaven Breaker, and in fact everyone from Heaven Breaker present, stood dumbfounded on the spot. The Dreamweaver side was also stunned; they kept glancing between Meng Kongchan and Yun Che, who still stood at the center of the battlefield, their expressions and emotions more tangled and complicated than anything they had ever experienced in their lives.
 
Meng Jianxi took two steps forward, standing beside Meng Kongchan, trying hard to steady his breathing.
 
Before arriving at the Pure Land, back when the profound arks of the two kingdoms had connected, he had briefly entertained such a conjecture. But that conjecture was too terrifying, too absurd, and he had instantly suppressed it.
 
Yet he never expected that it would actually... be true.
 
But when, by what chance, for what reason had all of this happened...?
 
“Alas, this is truly an... unexpected grand drama,” Wu Shenxing sighed deeply.
 
Wu Shenyue said, “This… I fear the rock-solid alliance of Boundless, Heaven Breaker, and Dreamweaver will crumble overnight.”
 
“No, perhaps it’s even more serious.”
 
Wu Shenxing said, “All of this is happening upon the Pure Land, under the very eyes of the Abyssal Monarch.”
 
“So that means…”
 
Wu Shenyue’s eyes narrowed, a strange light flickering within: “That Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter’s earlier sword strike—casting aside all consequences—was not to vent anger for Dian Jiuzhi at all, but rather… to use the favor bestowed by the Abyssal Monarch to dissolve her engagement with Dian Jiuzhi.”
 
“What a pity... it's too late.”
 
After speaking, he shook his head and repeated those two words, “What a pity…”
 
“Hahahahaha! Hahahahahahaha!”
 
Shenwu Yanye suddenly let out a wild, manic laugh, laughing so hard her entire palanquin trembled.
 
“This is what romantic love is… how filthy… how tragic… hahahahaha… a joke… truly a monumental joke… hahahahaha!”
 
She laughed without end, even more madly than when Shenwu Yi had brushed Dian Jiuzhi aside… but the lingering echo of her laughter carried a faint trace of sorrow.
 
Yun Che stood quietly in place, his face presenting the pallor after forcibly activating **God Ash**... but in the eyes of others, it was undoubtedly a state of huge panic.
 
Dian Luohou's gaze, at this time, was cast toward Meng Kongchan.
 
He seemed to try to find confusion, anger... on Meng Kongchan's face. But there wasn't any, only painful struggle like Hua Fuchen.
 
"So,"
 
He spoke: "You also... knew long ago?"
 
All gazes fell on Meng Kongchan.
 
"Yes." He answered.
 
Dian Luohou's face turned ashen at a terrible speed. The muscles on his face twitched, his lion-like body swaying, teetering several times.
 
"Heh... Hehehe..." He laughed, laughing exceptionally hoarsely, then big laughter, wild laughter... "Haha... Hahaha... Hahahahahaha!"
 
His big laughter was still so ear-shaking, but it no longer had a shred of his usual majesty and boldness, instead carrying a bone-piercing sorrow.
 
Hua Fuchen clenched his hands tight, speaking painfully: "Old Dian..."
 
"SHUT UP!!"
 
A heaven-shaking angry shout drowned out Hua Fuchen's voice: "Is 'Old Dian' something you are worthy of saying!? Are you worthy!? ARE YOU WORTHY!!!"
 
Dian Luohou's eyes were red like blood, his eyeballs covered with countless shocking blood streaks.
 
Hua Fuchen moved his lips, closing his eyes painfully again.
 
He and Meng Kongchan had anticipated many outcomes, good or bad... and the worst outcome among them was being known by Dian Luohou in advance before all preparations were made.
 
To avoid this evil result, Yun Che and Hua Caili were in different countries these years, unable to meet. After the Pure Land, no matter how reluctant, they had to be forcibly separated.
 
But they didn't expect that such an omission would occur in this short Pure Land Conference.
 
Even less did they expect... the situation was actually a thousand, ten thousand times worse than the worst outcome they anticipated.
 
If Dian Luohou learned about it privately, although he would be furious, he would absolutely seal the news, preserving the dignity of the Boundless Kingdom of God and the Boundless Divine Son Dian Jiuzhi to the greatest extent. The matters afterwards would be the internal affairs of their three people and three Kingdoms of God.
 
But at this moment... when all this was caught off guard and revealed, the six kingdoms and the Dragon Clan were all present, and it was even before the Abyssal Monarch and the Chief High Priest.
 
What was inflicted on Dian Luohou was undoubtedly betrayal and humiliation magnified to the extreme.
 
"Hua Fuchen, Meng Kongchan!"
 
He called the names of his former close friends directly, yet every sound was shrill, every word gnashing teeth: "One daughter, betraying my son's affection; one son, stealing my son's wife!"
 
"You clearly knew... YOU CLEARLY KNEW!! Yet not only did you not stop it, but you treated me like a stupid pig, played me like a clay dog!
 
Hehe... Hahahaha... You truly are my good brothers, GOOD BROTHERS! Hahahahaha!"
 
How glorious was Dian Luohou's life? He was incredibly noble from birth; his innate Divine Essence made him the Boundless Divine Son, unmatched by any male of his generation. After succeeding as the Divine Regent, he became the Foremost Divine Regent of the six Kingdoms of God, shaking the Abyss, the number one person under the Pure Land of the Abyssal World.
 
But what he was most proud of in this life was not the title of the Foremost Divine Regent, but the two close friends he made since childhood and who eventually became Divine Regents together. Such friendship, such close connection, a fate that relied on each other even after becoming Divine Regents, how precious, how inconceivable.
 
But, it just had to be the two of them who gave him the greatest betrayal and shame in this life.
 
Hua Caili's small hand tightly grasped Hua Qingying's lapel, panicked to the point of tears. She bit her lip, daring not look at her Father God's eyes, only emitting low sobs time and again: "Father God... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."
 
Traveling the Pure Land with Yun Che was her active invitation because she really couldn't suppress her longing.
 
They maintained distance and restraint the whole time, only that short few breaths of uncontrollability in front of Ling Xian's Divine Dwelling...
 
Hua Qingying raised her hand to protect her, comforting softly: "Things have come to this, no need to blame yourself."
 
"HUA CAILI!!" Dian Luohou's furious roar actually fell directly on Hua Caili.
 
He pointed at Hua Caili, his fingertip trembling violently: "What a Heaven Breaker Divine Daughter, what a daughter of Hua Fuchen! My son Jiuzhi's deep affection for you, treating you so well, is known to the world, visible to the heavens!"
 
"For you, for a full three thousand one hundred and twenty years, he didn't let half a woman near him! For you, he swore that even as the Boundless Divine Regent in this life, he would only have you alone! Even more for you..."
 
"Father God."
 
Dian Jiuzhi walked over, gently pressing down the palm Dian Luohou extended: "I know Father God must be angry at this moment, but... please listen to a word from your child for now."
 
He took a deep breath, using an extremely peaceful, extremely sincere voice to say: "Actually, between Caili and me, we have long severed the engagement."
 
Hua Fuchen and Meng Kongchan looked sideways simultaneously, their expressions astonished.
 
"..."
 
Dian Luohou slowly turned his eyes: "What did you say!?"
 
Facing Dian Luohou's unprecedentedly terrible gaze, Dian Jiuzhi still maintained a calm demeanor: "I originally thought my feelings for Caili were romantic love, but as time passed, suddenly one day, I was startled to realize that what I have for Caili is actually the sibling friendship formed in our youth."
 
"And Caili is innocent and naive, never knowing what romantic love is, merely simply obeying the engagement set for her by the Heart Painter Divine Regent in her ignorance. Therefore, whether for me or Caili, we have long hoped to break this engagement, just never had the chance to say it."
 
"Originally, meeting the Abyssal Monarch at this Pure Land Assembly was the most appropriate time, but I didn't expect..."
 
**PA!!!!**
 
An incredibly heavy slap ruthlessly struck Dian Jiuzhi's face; that terrible cracking sound clearly meant his frontal bone was shattered.
 
Dian Jiuzhi tumbled far away onto the ground, his body twitching in pain.
 
A group of Boundless elders turned pale with fright, rushing forward in panic: "Your Reverence, quell your anger..."
 
"SCRAM!!"
 
With a furious roar from Dian Luohou, all those approaching were ruthlessly blasted away, vomiting blood.
 
In everyone's horrified gazes, Dian Luohou walked to Dian Jiuzhi who was paralyzed on the ground, his eyes filled with terrifying gloom: "Although I am strict with you, I have never beaten you. Today, do you know why!?"
 
Dian Jiuzhi opened his mouth, but only gushed out large patches of bloody froth.
 
"Do you believe your own words! Do you take me for a fool, or take the Abyssal Monarch, take everyone in the world for fools!"
 
"I... I..."
 
Dian Jiuzhi dared not get up, dared not even look up.
 
"Tell me,"
 
Dian Luohou's chest heaved as if about to split: "What is a man's greatest hatred, what is a man's greatest shame!"
 
Dian Jiuzhi's gaze lost focus, speaking with difficulty: "A man's greatest hatred is the hatred of killing his father; a man's greatest shame is... the shame of having his wife stolen."
 
"Heh... Hehehe..."
 
Dian Luohou emitted a sorrowful and angry sneer: "Do you know that starting from today, everyone in this world will know that you, the dignified Boundless Divine Son, had your betrothed wife stolen by someone!"
 
"Everyone will sneer at you, pity you! Even the lowliest person in this world can treat you as conversation fodder, as a huge joke!"
 
"Even if you become a Divine Regent in the future, even if your future achievements surpass mine ten times over, this brand of shame will always exist, never fading! Everyone seeing you will first think that you are a pitiful worm whose wife was stolen... dragging the Boundless Kingdom of God down into humiliation with you!"
 
"And that Meng Jianyuan... even if he accomplishes nothing in the future, before him, you will forever be a loser, forever a joke, do you understand! UNDERSTAND!!"
 
Dian Jiuzhi buried his head deeply, only panting extremely heavily.
 
"And you, are actually still trying to exonerate them, actually still trying to defend them! I... Heh, I, Dian Luohou, am a joke, and my son, Dian Luohou's son, is an even bigger joke... Hahahaha, HAHAHAHAHA!"
 
"Old Dian..."
 
Meng Kongchan could no longer remain silent, speaking with difficulty: "You are not a joke, the fault lies with us..."
 
Dian Luohou jerked his head around; that excessively terrible gaze was like a poisoned steel needle, stabbing Meng Kongchan into speechlessness instantly.
 
"Meng Kongchan, Hua Fuchen,"
 
His gaze trembled, his lips opening and closing, every word sorrowful: "I, Dian Luohou, what exactly did I do wrong, where exactly did I let you down, for you to treat me like this..."
 
Meng Kongchan and Hua Fuchen's lips moved, but both were speechless facing him, even more ashamed to face him.
 
**BOOM!!!**
 
With a loud explosion, Dian Luohou's figure appeared before Hua Fuchen; that terrible aura forced the Seven Sword Sovereigns away in an instant.
 
He suddenly reached out, firmly grabbing Hua Fuchen's collar, hauling his Divine Regent body off the ground, his glaring eyes nearly exploding: "What exactly did I do wrong, to make you treat me like this... SPEAK! SPEAK!!"
 
Hua Fuchen did not resist in the slightest, allowing Dian Luohou's furious aura to seep into his flesh and bones, his heart filled only with endless guilt and defeat.
 
"Release His Reverence!" The Seven Sword Sovereigns shouted in unison, but before they could act, a bronze profound light descended from the sky.
 
*Clang!*
 
An irresistible force repelled Dian Luohou far away. The bronze profound light did not dissipate but lay across between Dian Luohou and Hua Fuchen, as if completely isolating the space they were in.
 
The Chief High Priest's voice of judgment also rang out at this time: "Above the Pure Land, private fights are forbidden. Boundless Divine Regent, considering your soul is trapped in an abyss of rage and you didn't truly attack, I will not pursue it for now; reflect and control yourself. No matter what grievances, wait until leaving the Pure Land to deal with them!"
 
Dian Luohou looked up at the Abyssal Monarch, forcibly suppressing the anger about to lose control, only his clenched hands were still trembling uncontrollably.
 
And at this time, the Abyssal Monarch's voice rang out atop Eden's Crown: "Rage, breaking This Monarch's command, what punishment should be bestowed?"
 
The Chief High Priest responded faintly: "The Punishment of Desolate Devouring."
 
"The Punishment of Desolate Devouring."
 
As soon as these five extremely short words came out, the incomparably powerful Heart Painter and Dreamless Divine Regents instantly had all the blood in their faces drain, their features presenting a terror that absolutely shouldn't appear on a Divine Regent.
 
"Donghuang."
 
The Chief High Priest raised his eyes to give the order: "Take down Yun Che and Hua Caili!"
