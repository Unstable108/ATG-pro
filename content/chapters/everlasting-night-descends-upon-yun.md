Yun Che's expression froze for a moment, and he quickly said, "Senior Liu Xiao, you flatter me. Cookbooks are, in the end, inanimate objects. The same recipes, the same ingredients, yet in the hands of different people, they can bloom with distinct colors, aromas, and flavors. Although they are gifts from a junior, to be able to fall into Senior's hands is undoubtedly the greatest fortune for them."

As his words fell, he took a step back and bowed respectfully. "I take my leave."

Divine Official Liu Xiao watched the two leave, his gaze complex. Once they were far away, when his gaze fell back onto the jade slip, it once again regained an undeniable fervor.

Divine Attendant Yuan Ying, neatly dressed, walked in from outside and said with a bitter expression, "Oh, my Master, my liver is still trembling¹. Please, in the future, never do such frightening things again."

Divine Official Liu Xiao completely ignored him, his gaze still fixed solely on the jade slip, as if immersed in a sea of dreams from which he didn't wish to awaken.

"However..." Divine Attendant Yuan Ying was clearly accustomed to this, and he continued on his own, "This matter with Cai Li... it can only be big, not small². Once it's revealed, it will certainly be difficult to end peacefully."

Divine Official Liu Xiao finally reacted. He finally brought himself to lift his head and murmured, "Yun Che, Meng Jian Yuan... This young man is far from simple."

"Oh?" Divine Attendant Yuan Ying's interest greatly increased. "It's the first time I've heard Master speak such words of praise about a junior. I imagine... it's not just about his culinary skills, right?"

"Of course not."

"When the Divine Inheritors of the Six Divine Nations first meet a Divine Official, they are all invariably nervous and fearful. To be able to force themselves to be calm, and maintain a humble yet not servile demeanor, is already rare. But this young man, his composure, comes from within. Even every flattering remark he made was perfectly appropriate³."

He raised the jade slip in his hand. "This thing was taken out after I agreed to help, not before... Between the two, the difference is immense."

"Just now, I asked him what he wanted me to exchange for it. His reply was humble and polite; every word was filled with respect and flattery towards me, as if my not accepting it would be burying its worth. But in reality, he did not deny the words 'exchange'."

He narrowed his eyes. "One must know that the most expensive things in this world are often those that are 'free of charge'."

Divine Attendant Yuan Ying seemed thoughtful. Then he said, "Since Master already knows this clearly, why didn't you refuse?"

Divine Official Liu Xiao, however, glared at him. "Refuse my ass⁴! You've followed me for so many years, yet you're not even as clear-sighted as that young Yun. Is this something I could refuse?! This is a divine object, a truly divine object!"

Divine Attendant Yuan Ying pressed his nose, speechless.

"I don't know what kind of old monster his master is, to actually teach such a little monster in just a mere hundred years. And then that rascal Meng Kong Chan picked him up. This generation of the Weaving Dream Divine Nation has truly hit the jackpot⁵, tsk tsk."

"Not necessarily, oh." Divine Attendant Yuan Ying slowly said, "Cai Li's engagement to Dian Jiu Zhi was personally sanctioned by His Highness Abyss Emperor, and it is known and witnessed by all under heaven. Dian Luo Hou's fierce temperament is also known to everyone. And most seriously... Lord Abyss Emperor possesses a profound magnanimity, but his greatest, perhaps his only taboo, is betrayal of affection."

He shook his head. "It's difficult, ah. Could this be what they call 'fortune and misfortune are intertwined'⁶?"

"None of your damn business⁷, scram, scram, scram!" Divine Official Liu Xiao couldn't be bothered to listen to him any further. He directly waved him away with a slap. "Don't delay me from studying this divine object."

"Uh, there's one more thing." Divine Attendant Yuan Ying quickly said, "Master must have also noticed that Yun Che's ability to control flames is extremely strange. Such an anomaly, even for Lord Ling Xian..."

"Get out, now!!"

Divine Official Liu Xiao impatiently kicked out. Divine Attendant Yuan Ying's vision blurred, and he was instantly sent flying a thousand zhang⁸ away. His scolding voice poured into his ears: "How many times have I told you, don't bother with worldly affairs, keep your mind free from the dust of the world⁹! No matter how strange he is, even if he's a reincarnated Creation God, it has nothing to do with you!!"

Divine Attendant Yuan Ying got up. The first thing he did was still meticulously brush off the dust from his clothes. Only then did he slowly say, "Yes, yes, yes, I respectfully obey Master's teachings."

He looked in the direction Yun Che and Hua Cai Li had departed, sensing the changes in the aura of the Pure Land, and leisurely murmured to himself, "This time's Pure Land gathering, I'm afraid there's going to be a big show to watch¹⁰."

Inside the divine dwelling, Divine Official Liu Xiao, hunched over, read the jade slip in his hand again and again, murmuring to himself.

"This young man, his name is actually so flashy. It's more like a woman's preference."

"This young man's eyes are like a deep abyss, his heart like a bright flame. But I was wrong about one thing: imprisoned in this illusory world, how can one speak of being unrestrained...? Only delicious food will never betray me. Huo ha ha ha ha... hic!"

"Elder Brother Yun, you're truly amazing. I originally thought you only surpassed Uncle Liu Xiao by a little. I didn't expect Uncle Liu Xiao to be so shocked he almost turned silly! He even wants to take you as his master, hee hee hee!"

Her joyful laughter was even more refreshing and flawless than the dome light of the Pure Land. Even the gentle breeze seemed softened by her smile, quietly brushing past the curve of her lips.

Yun Che's gaze unconsciously avoided her smiling face. He looked ahead and said, "So, you brought me to visit the various Divine Officials for this purpose. Aren't you worried that our matter will be revealed too early because of this, and instead catch your Divine Father and Divine Venerable Wu Meng off guard?"

Hua Cai Li said without any worry, "Uncle Liu Xiao is obsessed with the culinary arts. He absolutely refuses to interfere in any external affairs. Even if it's a secret ten times bigger, he wouldn't bother to say a single word more. And the only thing that can move him is the culinary arts. It just so happens that Elder Brother is most skilled in this art, so I definitely had to try. Even if it failed, he would absolutely not want to meddle."

"Grandma Ling Xian dotes on me the most; she definitely wouldn't do anything bad to me. And besides..." She secretly glanced at Yun Che, her voice dropping a few notches. "Actually, back then, after Uncle Abyss Emperor bestowed the engagement, Grandma Ling Xian once said that I was too young to be engaged when I knew nothing about romantic love. It was hard to say whether it would be a blessing or a curse, and she worried that I would have a day of regret. And once that regret arose, it would likely bind me for life."

Yun Che: "..."

"Back then, I was ignorant and naive. Only after meeting Elder Brother Yun did I truly understand Grandma Ling Xian's words. I think, since Grandma Ling Xian already had foresight and worries, she will definitely be the one who understands my feelings and current situation the most, and will definitely be the most willing to help us. Unfortunately, she just happened to have a relapse of an old illness... I hope Grandma Ling Xian can recover safely soon."

Yun Che smiled, his face filled with emotion. "This misfortune arose because of me; this matter, in fact, should be handled by me..."

"Between us, there's no need to distinguish between 'yours' and 'mine'," Hua Cai Li interrupted him, half-joking, half-serious, she said.

Yun Che stopped speaking. Then he also nodded firmly. "Mm! Between us, there's long been no distinction. Plus, we have the backing of your Divine Father and Divine Venerable Wu Meng, and Divine Official Liu Xiao has also promised to lend his aid. The future will definitely be smoother than we anticipated."

"Of course." The young girl smiled brightly, her eyes shimmering like flowing rosy clouds¹³. Her body unconsciously leaned a little closer to Yun Che, but then she rationally moved slightly away. For her, compared to worries about the future, the joy and lack of regret from meeting and falling in love with Yun Che far outweighed them.

Divine Official Wan Dao managed the core resources of the Pure Land. He was extremely cautious and upright, so Hua Cai Li naturally wouldn't try to seek his help.

The Grand Divine Official, needless to say, was the only being Hua Cai Li feared in the Pure Land.

To be able to receive Divine Official Liu Xiao's promise of aid, she was already overjoyed. She walked alongside Yun Che, lingering for a long time, only then did she reluctantly part with him and returned to Hua Fu Chen's side.

Yun Che's steps remained slow. His gaze was calm, sensing the changes in every wisp of aura around him. The direction he was heading, however, was not towards the Weaving Dream Divine Nation.

"What are you thinking about?" Li Suo, sensing Yun Che's thoughts, suddenly spoke.

Yun Che's steps did not stop. He murmured softly, "Laugh at others, laugh at oneself, laugh at ancient and modern times; laugh at heaven, laugh at earth, laugh at the stupa¹¹."

"Laughing at others, laughing at oneself, laughing at heaven and earth, laughing at ancient and modern times—all convey a carefree and unrestrained attitude that dismisses everything. Only 'laughing at the stupa'... when Cai Li first mentioned it to me, I felt an indescribable strangeness, or rather, a mismatch."

"Today, having met Divine Official Liu Xiao, I somewhat understand what 'laughing at the stupa' means."

Li Suo listened quietly for the answer.

Yun Che, however, did not explain directly. Instead, he spoke words with a hidden meaning: "Laughing at the worldly dust¹² perhaps isn't necessarily the unrestrained freedom after seeing through everything. It could also be... extreme despondency and reclusion after seeing through everything."

Li Suo pondered for a long time, then softly said, "Are you saying that Divine Official Liu Xiao's temperament isn't unrestrained and free, but rather despondent and reclusive? As a Divine Official, looking down upon heaven and scorning the world, there seems to be no reason for him to be like this... And how does this relate to the three words 'laughing at the stupa'?"

Yun Che smiled faintly. "The three words 'laughing at the stupa,' which sound the most profound and mysterious, could actually be the most straightforward three words; their meaning is exactly what they say. Of course, it's more likely that I'm wrong. After all, it was just a very superficial encounter; how dare I make a rash judgment."

Li Suo, however, said, "If it truly were a 'rash judgment' made without any certainty, your mind wouldn't be so deeply immersed in it. Clearly, you have a strong grasp of this conjecture, and there's a high probability that it can be used by you."

"Oh..." Yun Che slightly narrowed his eyes, not quite praising. "Little Li Suo, should I say you're getting smarter, or that you understand me better and better?"

Li Suo faintly let out a very faint sigh, offering no response. After a while, she once again emitted her ethereal, dream-like celestial voice: "At the very least, do not try to exploit beings like True Gods too early. Playing with fire easily leads to self-immolation¹⁴. For people at the level of Divine Officials, you are merely a wisp of insignificant grass dust. No flame is even needed; a single spark carelessly splashed out could burn you into ashes with no return."

"Don't worry, I understand." Yun Che's voice carried a seriousness that Li Suo could clearly perceive. "To reiterate... and to assure you once more, I cherish my life very much."

At this moment, the gentle breeze of the Pure Land suddenly stagnated. The world ahead suddenly dimmed by a fraction.

That was not the fading of light, but a sudden obstruction of perception.

Yun Che raised his head and fixed his gaze, looking at a line of figures slowly passing by in the distant sky.

That was a divine might aura unique to a Divine Nation, yet it cast down a heavy oppression that the Heaven-Folding Divine Nation and Weaving Dream Divine Nation had absolutely never possessed.

Although they were far away, Yun Che still recognized at a glance that this group of a hundred people were all women.

The name of a Divine Nation instantly appeared in Yun Che's mind.

That Divine Nation, which could be called the most special, most mysterious, and most infamous among the Six Divine Nations, and was also the Divine Nation that Meng Kong Chan, Hua Cai Li, and Hua Qing Ying had all warned him never to approach lightly:

The Everlasting Night Divine Nation!
