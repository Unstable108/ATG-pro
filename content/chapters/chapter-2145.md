No one dared to defy the rules of the Pure Land, including the Divine Regents of the six Kingdoms of God.
 
But there was one exception, for his very existence stood above all the rules of this world.
 
The Abyssal Monarch.
 
The Heaven Breaker sword into which Hua Caili had poured her entire will, and the glazed cold light with which Shenwu Yi had utterly defeated Dian Jiuzhi... before him, they were like fragile bubbles that shattered at a touch, vanishing without a sound or trace.
 
His hands slowly lowered, and amidst the stunned daze of the crowd, he spoke faintly: "A body harboring the Exquisite, a heart deriving the Glazed Glass... this is unprecedented in all of eternity, truly a divine miracle bestowed by the heavens."
 
"Caili, though merely just past the age of twenty, you have already glimpsed the true meaning of the fourth sword of Heaven Breaker. In terms of talent in the Sword Dao alone, you have not only surpassed your aunt, but are also not far from Us in Our youth."
 
The Abyssal Monarch’s intervention not only astonished the six great Kingdoms of God, but even the Chief High Priest was surprised.
 
And the evaluations he gave Shenwu Yi and Hua Caili undoubtedly shook their hearts like thunderclaps.
 
To Shenwu Yi, from the mouth of the Abyssal Monarch, came the two words "Divine Miracle."
 
To Hua Caili, he actually compared her to himself!
 
"If either of you were to suffer even the slightest injury, it would be a colossal loss to this world. Therefore, let this battle cease here. How about it?"
 
Though the Abyssal Monarch phrased it as a question, once the words left his mouth, they were a Divine Decree.
 
Shenwu Yi calmly sheathed her sword, bowing in respect: "Wu Yi strictly obeys the Abyssal Monarch’s command."
 
Hua Caili’s ability to adapt was ultimately slightly weaker, and she did not harbor the same reverence for the Abyssal Monarch in her heart as others did. After being dazed for a good while, she stammered, "But... then... Uncle Abyssal Monarch’s promised favor..."
 
The Abyssal Monarch’s gaze seemed to tilt slightly toward Hua Caili, containing a hint of a smile: "The grace and elegance of you two are naturally enough for Us to make an exception and grant a favor to both."
 
The Abyssal Monarch’s words did not move Shenwu Yi in the slightest, yet they caused infinite, brilliant starlight to suddenly flare in Hua Caili’s eyes: "Re... really!? Thank you, Uncle Abyssal Monarch! Uncle Abyssal Monarch is truly the best!"
 
Atop Eden’s Crown, beside the Abyssal Monarch, amidst the battlefield... her jubilation was displayed so plainly, intensely, and genuinely.
 
"..."
 
Dian Jiuzhi closed his eyes, concealing the loss within them, and sighed faintly in his heart.
 
At this moment, he suddenly understood why Hua Caili’s actions had been so contrary to common sense and her temperament.
 
She did not hesitate to reveal such a decisive side, did not hesitate to heavily injure herself, did not hesitate to give her all... all to obtain the Abyssal Monarch’s favor. Only because this favor concerned her and Yun Che’s future.
 
Hua Fuchen let out a long sigh of relief, only then realizing that his back was cold, completely soaked in cold sweat.
 
Hua Caili’s joy still did not recede. Her entire aura was completely different from when she held the sword; she had transformed completely from a little Sword Immortal releasing biting might into a peerlessly beautiful young girl who had been spoiled and pampered.
 
She turned her eyes to look at Shenwu Yi and said very frankly, "As for this battle with the Eternal Night Divine Daughter, there’s no need to just stop it. I concede. Because even if I used my full strength, I would only have a one‑in‑a‑hundred chance of victory. The remaining ninety‑nine parts belong to the Eternal Night Divine Daughter."
 
The Abyssal Monarch smiled and offered no comment.
 
The Chief High Priest wasted no words and immediately announced: "Heaven Breaker's Hua Caili concedes. Eternal Night's Shenwu Yi wins!"
 
"And in this Battle of the Divine Sons, both Eternal Night's Shenwu Yi and Heaven Breaker's Hua Caili displayed outstanding grace, truly stunning. Having gained the Abyssal Monarch’s favor and praise, a special exception is granted: both Shenwu Yi and Hua Caili may request a boon from the Abyssal Monarch."
 
With the Abyssal Monarch’s promise and the Chief High Priest’s proclamation, the dust settled on the results of this Battle of the Divine Children.
 
In this Battle of the Divine Children, counting the unexpected Pan Buwang, a total of six Divine Sons and two Divine Daughters took the field. In the end, however, both Divine Daughters emerged victorious, while the six great Divine Sons were all reduced to foils. Especially Dian Jiuzhi, who was once the Foremost Divine Son; all his former glory was almost completely eclipsed by Shenwu Yi’s icy radiance.
 
This result caused the multitude of Kingdoms of God to sigh endlessly.
 
Hua Caili put away the Glazed Cloud Sword. As she turned around, her vision suddenly blurred, and she nearly collapsed softly to the ground on the spot.
 
Amidst a flash of green shadow, she had already fallen onto Hua Qingying’s body. Only then did she realize she had completely lost her strength; even lifting her arm was quite a struggle.
 
Hua Fuchen also hurried over. Looking at his daughter’s pale cheeks that were nonetheless filled with a satisfied smile, the words of reprimand he had prepared were ultimately too harsh to speak. He could only fiercely mutter: "It’s all that brat’s fault!"
 
Hua Qingying’s profound energy meticulously flowed through Hua Caili’s entire body before she completely set her mind at ease. The Abyssal Monarch’s timely intervention meant the might of that sword was ultimately not released, so naturally, there was no backlash.
 
But the consumption to condense that sword was truly too great. At this moment, Hua Caili was in a state of severe exhaustion in both body and spirit.
 
One could imagine that if she had suffered a backlash in such a state, the consequences would have been simply...
 
Hua Qingying did not dare to think about it. She lifted Hua Caili and returned to the Heaven Breaker Kingdom of God’s location.
 
The Seven Sword Sovereigns of Heaven Breaker quickly approached, and seven gentle sword auras immediately gathered around Hua Caili, allowing her aura to recover at an astonishing speed.
 
"In the future, you are forbidden from doing this," Hua Fuchen finally reprimanded her with a sentence.
 
"I know, Father God. I promise I won’t do it again." Hua Caili put on an obedient appearance of humbly accepting the lesson, then said without losing her pride, "But, precisely because of this sword, I succeeded."
 
First admitting her mistake, then undermining him in the next breath... Hua Fuchen raised his hand to cover his face, and could only glare fiercely at Yun Che in the distance again.
 
Hua Qingying said faintly, "Acting so recklessly regardless of the consequences... other than winning the Abyssal Monarch’s favor, did you have no other thoughts?"
 
"None!" Hua Caili looked away, absolutely refusing to admit it.
 
Sha Xing returned at this precise moment, looking at the situation before him, momentarily dumbfounded.
 
Xian Yue said methodically: "The Battle of the Divine Children has ended. Dian Jiuzhi was defeated by Shenwu Yi. Meng Jianxi avoided battle and conceded. The battle between Shenwu Yi and Hua Caili was personally stopped by the Abyssal Monarch, who specially granted favors to both, after which Hua Caili voluntarily conceded."
 
These words caused layers of shock to stack upon Sha Xing’s face, leaving him unable to recover for a long time.
 
Only then did Xian Yue unhurriedly take out a Profound Imagery Stone: "I have engraved all the scenes from after you left for you. As expected, I have foresight; otherwise, you would have regrettably missed too many wondrous sights that could be called world-shocking."
 
Over at the Boundless Kingdom of God, Dian Luohou stroked his long beard, wearing a smile of approval, appearing to have completely forgotten the anger of Dian Jiuzhi’s defeat and humiliation.
 
"That girl Caili usually looks delicate and weak. I never expected that for Jiuzhi’s sake, she would have such a fierce side. Coupled with this Sword Dao talent that even surpasses Qingying... she is truly worthy of being my daughter-in-law! Hwahahahaha!"
 
Speaking to the end, he laughed heartily in satisfaction.
 
However, he failed to notice that behind him, Dian Sansi’s face was pitch black.
 
"Brother Jiuzhi..." He looked at Dian Jiuzhi cautiously, wanting to offer comfort but not knowing what to say.
 
Dian Jiuzhi, however, shook his head, then revealed a faint smile. That smile... seemed to be a kind of relief.
 
But the more he acted like this, the more Dian Sansi’s heart twitched with uncontrollable pain.
 
Involuntarily, he turned his gaze toward Yun Che, only to once again "coincidentally" meet the other party’s gaze.
 
Their gazes collided.
 
Yun Che’s eyebrows curved downward, the corners of his mouth hooked up. He was smiling—it was mockery, it was smugness, and even more so, it was contempt.
 
Immediately following that, he listlessly turned his face away, as if he felt disdain even looking at him for one more second.
 
And the moment he turned his gaze, Dian Sansi clearly saw the slight movement of Yun Che’s mouth.
 
*Pa... thetic...*
 
"~！@#￥%……"
 
All the blood in his body rushed to the top of his head in an instant. Dian Sansi turned crimson from his neck to his face as if dyed in blood, and even his vision blurred.
 
The urge to explode and let everything out, to make his Father God furious, to make the Abyssal Monarch send down punishment, to make Yun Che and Hua Caili ruined and shamed... rolled frantically in his heart like madness. But following closely behind was the dread of the consequences and Dian Jiuzhi’s almost pleading admonition...
 
It took a full several breaths before he clenched his teeth, forcefully suppressing the surging humiliation, rage, hatred, and unwillingness... bit by bit.
 
But even exhausting his entire will, he could only suppress it to his throat. Although he forcibly endured not exploding, he could not swallow it completely no matter what. It was stuck raw in his throat, and every breath was so filled with anger, humiliation, and discomfort that he felt he would burst.
 
This was a torturous suffering he had never imagined in his life.
 
"Mn, it’s just about the critical point of the critical point," Yun Che muttered leisurely in his soul.
 
"Dian Sansi?" Li Suo asked.
 
"Yes." Yun Che said: "Now, just a casual poke and there’s a possibility he'll explode. And if he’s given another big stimulus... his clear-headedness will be completely destroyed. No matter what situation he is in, he will undoubtedly explode."
 
Li Suo whispered softly: "The Battle of the Divine Children has ended. The opportunity you need..."
 
"This opportunity, the Abyssal Monarch will naturally give to me. Perhaps, he is even more anxious than I am."
 
Li Suo: "......??"
 
Waiting until Hua Caili had recovered to a sufficient condition, the Abyssal Monarch slowly spoke: "Caili, what reward do you desire?"
 
Hua Caili bowed with a graceful smile, speaking without the slightest timidity: "The reward Caili wants is rather special. I wish to tell Uncle Abyssal Monarch privately, may I?"
 
The Abyssal Monarch smiled: "Naturally, there is no objection. It is just that with no one to witness it then, are you not afraid that We will go back on Our word?"
 
"Uncle Abyssal Monarch wouldn’t do that. Thank you in advance, Uncle Abyssal Monarch." Hua Caili bowed again, then retreated behind Hua Qingying with a smile.
 
The Abyssal Monarch’s gaze shifted to Shenwu Yi: "Shenwu Yi, what reward do you seek?"
 
Shenwu Yi’s response was concise and clear: "Answering the Abyssal Monarch: Wuyi wishes to enter the **Forbidden Realm of Divine Slumber**."
 
As soon as these words came out, everyone was astonished.
 
From the pitch-black palanquin where the Lightless Divine Regent sat, a burst of abnormal profound energy fluctuation suddenly transmitted out, wrapped in all-too-obvious anger.
 
Clearly, what Shenwu Yi sought deviated from her expectations.
 
"The Forbidden Realm of Divine Slumber? What is that place?" Yun Che frowned and whispered.
 
During his three years in the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God, although his focus in gathering information was on the Divine Sons of the various Kingdoms of God, he knew about seventy to eighty percent of the important information regarding the Abyss. Yet, this was the first time he had heard this name.
 
Meng Jianxi also lowered his voice to answer: "Before the Abyssal World was formed, it was the place where the ancient gods fell after dropping into the Abyss. It is also... the place where the Abyssal Monarch fell into the Abyss."
 
"It is rumored that a large portion of those True Gods and Devil Gods who first fell transformed into Abyssal Ghosts under the erosion of the primordial abyssal dust... Later, when the Abyssal Monarch pioneered the Abyssal World, that land of buried gods was sealed off, becoming the 'Forbidden Realm of Divine Slumber'."
 
"I have never been to the Forbidden Realm of Divine Slumber, so I know very little about it. But according to the records of Xuanji Hall, although the Forbidden Realm of Divine Slumber is not located in the Endless Fog, the concentration of abyssal dust inside is comparable to the depths of the Endless Fog. The number of Abyssal Ghosts wandering within far exceeds that of Abyssal Beasts, and every Abyssal Ghost encountered could possibly be the ancestral deity of people of this era."
 
"Likely out of respect for the multitude of ancestral deities, the Abyssal Monarch sealed that area and listed it as a forbidden realm. I remember that since it became a forbidden realm until now, the recorded number of openings has not exceeded a dozen times."
 
Yun Che asked: "Since that is the case, why would Shenwu Yi waste the opportunity of such a precious reward to go to such a place?"
 
Meng Jianxi thought for a moment and said: "Too many ancient True Gods once stayed in that area. With their divine bodies, even under the primordial abyssal dust, they wouldn’t perish immediately. Thus, perhaps they left behind some legacies, extraordinary treasures, or the like before they died... Perhaps that is the reason?"
 
Meng Jianxi’s answer was full of hesitation and doubt; clearly, it was just a guess.
 
The Abyssal Monarch fell silent.
 
But he was only silent for two breaths before nodding slightly: "Good. As you wish."
 
"However," his tone shifted: "Since the Forbidden Realm of Divine Slumber is rarely opened, would it not be a pity for only one person to enter?"
 
"Zhuyuan."
 
The First Knight, Dugu Zhuyuan, stepped forward, bowing to receive the order.
 
"Ten hours from now, open the Void-Breaking Formation leading to the 'Forbidden Realm of Divine Slumber'. The six great Kingdoms of God may each select one junior to enter."
 
This order from the Abyssal Monarch caused the other five Kingdoms of God to be jolted in spirit, overjoyed.
 
This was not only the Abyssal Monarch’s grace extending to the five kingdoms, but it also made the five Kingdoms of God invisibly owe Shenwu Yi a favor.
 
"Wu Yi thanks the Abyssal Monarch for his grace."
 
Shenwu Yi naturally had no objection, nor did she show joy, retreating indifferently.
 
The Abyssal Monarch had announced the major events. The "Eternal Pure Land" was close at hand, and the Battle of the Divine Children had concluded. At this moment, it should have been time for the Abyssal Monarch to depart and for the Chief High Priest to announce the end of this Pure Land Conference.
 
But at this moment, the Abyssal Monarch cast his gaze toward the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God.
 
"Kongchan, We heard that after Caili, another Perfect Divine Essence descended from the heavens into the Dreamweaver Kingdom of God. Is there such a thing?"
