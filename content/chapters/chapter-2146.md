Stunned surprise and a hint of confusion flashed through Meng Kongchan's eyes. Everyone else was just as astonished and bewildered. Meng Kongchan stepped forward and bowed. "Replying to the Yuan Emperor, it is indeed my humble son, Jian Yuan. Jian Yuan once suffered a calamity and was lost for a century, but the heavens pitied Dreamweaver and protected him, allowing him to return to life and later awaken a Perfect Godhead."

"Yuan'er, come and greet the Yuan Emperor," Meng Kongchan said. Beyond his surprise, he couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement. If Meng Jian Yuan could make a good impression on the Yuan Emperor now, the resistance to his affair with Hua Caili would lessen, and it would only benefit his future.

Yun Che stood beside Meng Kongchan, matching his bow. "Yun Che of Dreamweaver pays his respects to the Yuan Emperor."

"..." Meng Kongchan's eye twitched, and the others wore strange expressions. His insistence on calling himself Yun Che was known throughout the six kingdoms. But in this situation, especially after Meng Kongchan had just introduced him as "Meng Jian Yuan" to the Yuan Emperor, for him to remain so adamant was three parts persistence... and seven parts foolishly failing to read the situation.

The Yuan Emperor, however, didn't seem to mind at all. His face, veiled in a faint divine light, even held a hint of wistfulness. "A Perfect Godhead is a rarity seen once in ten thousand years. For two to appear in the same era is simply unprecedented."

"The Son of Darkness, the Nine Profound Icy Heart, the twin stars appearing in the Abyss... This era is rife with portents. Perhaps they are all omens of our imminent arrival in the 'Eternal Pure Land'." Everyone listened intently to the Yuan Emperor's words. An emperor does not speak idly; his words must hold deep meaning.

"The 'Eternal Pure Land' is near. This Son of God Battle may be the last of this age. How could such a heaven-sent, brilliant star remain silent in this battle?" The Yuan Emperor's meaning was clear, surprising and yet seemingly logical. In what might be the final Son of God Battle of this age, the two history-making perfect stars should indeed display their brilliance before the world upon this Pure Land.

Joy filled Meng Kongchan's heart, though his face remained humble. "It is an unparalleled honor for my humble son Jian Yuan and for Dreamweaver to receive such praise from the Yuan Emperor. Kongchan is deeply humbled. However, Jian Yuan has been wandering for the past century without the benefit of any of Dreamweaver's resources. His cultivation is only at the Divine Sovereign Realm. I fear such a dim light is unworthy of the Yuan Emperor's and everyone else's notice."

"Hahahaha, Divine Master Wu Meng, you are mistaken."

Dian Luohou's thunderous, hearty voice boomed. "To reach the fourth level of the Divine Sovereign Realm at the age of two Jiazi¹ without the backing of a God Kingdom... if he had spent the last century safely in Dreamweaver, imagine how far he would have come!"

Dian Luohou continued, "I won't hide it from you all. After my humble son, Jiuzhi, spoke with Meng Jian Yuan, he couldn't stop praising him. He has mentioned him many times these past few years, and always with admiration. In his fifty-two Jiazi of life, this is the first time he has praised someone so highly. Based on that alone, even I wish to see for myself what this boy is capable of."

Dian Luohou was known for his straightforward temperament and never indulged in false praise. Dian Jiuzhi offered a faint smile, expressing his agreement.

Hua Fuchen also spoke with a smile, "Yun Che is only two Jiazi old, still a tender age for a God Inheritor. His cultivation realm is not important. Possessing a Perfect Godhead, he must have something astonishing and world-class about him. This is a miracle for the entire world, and it should naturally blossom in the Pure Land and shine upon the Abyssal World."

With his two close friends having paved the way for him, Meng Kongchan naturally set aside his "reluctance" and said solemnly, "In that case, we of Dreamweaver will naturally comply."

He turned his gaze to Yun Che, his eyes filled with deep meaning. "Yuan'er, this is a personal decree from the Yuan Emperor, an ultimate honor and fortune. Here, upon this Eden Cloud Summit, you shall display the might of a Perfect God Inheritor to the Yuan Emperor and the world... There is no need to be nervous; just act as you normally would. As for how you display it, that is entirely up to you."

He had no worries at all about Yun Che's "might"; in fact, he was more worried about scaring the Divine Masters. This sudden, heaven-sent opportunity was undoubtedly a tremendous and pleasant surprise at this Pure Land gathering. Hua Caili half-hid her face behind Hua Qingying, but it couldn't conceal her eyes and brows, which curved like crescent moons.

"Yes," Yun Che replied respectfully. He then straightened up and, meeting the varied gazes of the crowd, walked calmly and composedly into the still-active battlefield barrier. He could feel countless eyes focused on him, and the gaze from Dian Sansi, deeply hidden yet sharp with extreme hatred, was especially clear.

For the first time, Shen Wuyi's gaze truly fell upon Yun Che. A strange sense of a daze floated before her eyes, like a self-forming mist of ice. Startled back to her senses, her gaze quickly returned to its usual cold condensation, replaced by a fleeting flicker of doubt and confusion. To stand on the battlefield of the Son of God Battle without being a Son of God himself... this was likely a first for the Pure Land gathering.

His expression was nonchalant, his steps leisurely, as if strolling through a peaceful courtyard. From the highest Divine Masters to the youngest generation, no one could detect even a trace of nervousness or apprehension. It was not a feigned calm, but a composure that radiated from within. This point alone left the experts of the God Kingdoms astonished and impressed.

Reaching the center of the battlefield, Yun Che stopped. He scanned his surroundings but did not release his profound energy. Instead, he announced in a loud voice, "I, Yun Che of Dreamweaver, shamelessly take the liberty of challenging my peers from the God Kingdoms. Please, do not hesitate to grant me your guidance."

A battle between those of similar strength was undoubtedly the best way to showcase his abilities, so Yun Che's actions were not surprising. But after his call, a long silence followed with no response. Although Yun Che was not a Son of God of Dreamweaver, he possessed a Perfect Godhead, and Meng Kongchan's favor toward him was plain to see. It was all but certain he would be a Son of God in the future.

Since Yun Che had issued the challenge as a non-Son of God, any challenger would naturally have to be a peer from a God Kingdom who was also not a Son of God. In that case, to lose would be to merely lose face, becoming a simple stepping stone for Yun Che to display the splendor of his Perfect Godhead. But to accidentally win... the consequences would be far more severe than losing. Not only would they offend the future Son of God of Dreamweaver, but they would also embarrass the entire Dreamweaver God Kingdom, and likely even displease the Yuan Emperor who had proposed this. Moreover, although Meng Kongchan had suppressed news of Dreamweaver's God Conferment Ceremony three years ago, there were still many spectators. The news that Yun Che had single-handedly and easily defeated a host of profound practitioners of the same realm had long since spread to the other kingdoms.

Amidst the silence, the Grand Adjudicator's voice rang out, deep and deafening like a great bell. "Since there are no challengers, I grant you a right nearly equivalent to that of a Son of God in battle. You may choose any opponent, and they may not refuse the challenge!"

The Grand Adjudicator's words were clearly in accordance with the Yuan Emperor's will.

"Thank you, Grand Adjudicator." Yun Che gave a slight bow, then turned his body and gaze in unison, once again sweeping across the entire assembly. His gaze moved very slowly, clearly lingering on each person with great care.

From the Star Moon God Kingdom, to the Owl Butterfly God Kingdom, to the Heaven-Rending God Kingdom, and then to the Senluo God Kingdom... his gaze remained meticulous and slow. But the moment it landed on Dian Sansi, it flicked away instantly, as if he had touched something unbearably filthy, and even the corner of his mouth twitched imperceptibly. To others, this seemed like nothing, but for Dian Sansi, who directly met that fleeting touch of Yun Che's gaze, blood instantly rushed to his head. The hatred, frustration, and fury that had been stuck in his throat surged with the violent rush of blood, drowning most of his reason.

He took a sharp step forward and roared, "Yun Che, I will fight you!"

"Sansi!"

Dian Jiuzhi was greatly alarmed and quickly reached out to grab Dian Sansi's arm. He had personally witnessed the shocking scene of Yun Che sweeping through practitioners of the same realm and knew that if Dian Sansi's power was suppressed to the same level, he would be no match for him. But what worried him even more was Dian Sansi's clearly abnormal emotional state.

"Good lad!!"

Dian Luohou, however, first sighed and then began to laugh. "As they say, you don't get to know someone until you fight them.² Go on, have a good fight, and release all that pent-up resentment!!"

This was the Eden Cloud Summit. Once the words were spoken, they could not be taken back. Dian Jiuzhi could only say in an extremely low voice, "You may fight, but you absolutely must not cause trouble! Remember what I told you, and your promise!"

"Hmm??" No matter how low he kept his voice, how could it escape Dian Luohou? He glanced sideways, but with his straightforward nature, he wouldn't interfere or inquire about matters between the younger generation.

After shouting, Dian Sansi had a few moments of regret, but that was quickly followed by the desire for release. He took a deep breath and said in a low voice, "Brother Jiuzhi, don't worry. I will only fight... no words!"

Dian Jiuzhi released his hand. Dian Sansi leaped high into the air, straight into the barrier. The moment he landed, he kicked up a terrifying shockwave and a heaven-shaking roar.

"Tsk, what immense resentment," Meng Jianxi remarked with no small amount of mockery.

No matter how much Dian Sansi tried to suppress it, with the caliber of people present, the hatred and resentment that had reached his breaking point were easily detectable. Yet, no one found it too strange. It was common knowledge that Dian Jiuzhi was like an elder brother and a mentor to Dian Sansi, and that Dian Sansi admired and respected Dian Jiuzhi more than anyone in his life. And today, Dian Jiuzhi, the number one Son of God, had suffered such a crushing defeat, lost all his glory, and been humiliated with the most vicious and vile words by Divine Master Wu Ming... how could he not be filled with anger and resentment?

Everyone, including all of Senluo God Kingdom, deeply believed that this near-overwhelming resentment was because of Dian Jiuzhi, and that this challenge was a way to vent. Yun Che narrowed his eyes slightly, facing Dian Sansi, whose own eyes were churning with a tide of hatred. In his soul, however, he said with no small amount of smugness, "See? Here he comes."

Li Suo whispered, "Outside the Spirit Immortal Divine Dwelling, when you sensed Dian Jiuzhi and Dian Sansi approaching... was that really just on the spur of the moment?"

"Of course," Yun Che said leisurely. "There are many methods. When a particularly handy one presents itself, you naturally have to seize it and use it. And if you're going to use it, you use it to its fullest. Otherwise, wouldn't it be a waste?"

"Handy?"

"Yes. In the Profound Pivot Palace's intelligence on Dian Sansi, besides his evaluation as having a still-immature temperament, the handiest piece of information was his extreme reliance on and respect for Dian Jiuzhi."

"..." Li Suo had no reply.

"So it's Brother Sansi."

Yun Che wore a smile, and other than Dian Sansi opposite him, no one knew what deep malice was hidden behind that harmless-looking³ expression. "Thank you for gracing me with your guidance."

Dian Sansi's fists tightened slightly, but he said nothing. He had promised Dian Jiuzhi "only fight, no words," and he was even more afraid that if he opened his mouth, he would lose control of his words.

The Grand Adjudicator raised his hand, and the familiar bronze profound light shone faintly. "Meng Jian Yuan of Dreamweaver, cultivation at the fourth level of the Divine Sovereign Realm; Dian Sansi of Senluo, cultivation at the third level of the Divine Annihilation Realm. A Profound Desolation Seal is required to balance their cultivation."

"However, the cultivation gap between the two is too great, involving suppression across a major realm. In addition to profound energy, the suppression of physical strength across a major realm will be accompanied by several breaths of intense, full-body pain."

"It doesn't matter," Dian Sansi responded to the Grand Adjudicator in a relatively calm voice. "I'll trouble the Grand Adjudicator to proceed."

But then, a much clearer voice rang out. "Brother Sansi has graced me with his guidance. How could I, due to my own low cultivation, allow Brother Sansi to endure such an ordeal? I ask the Grand Adjudicator to refrain from applying the Profound Desolation Seal."

Unlike when Shen Wuyi had refused the seal earlier, the Grand Adjudicator did not cleanly retract it. Instead, he was visibly stunned. Because the difference between the two was not one or two minor realms, but a full nine minor realms... plus the chasm of a major realm. The sixth and eighth levels of the Divine Annihilation Realm was a disparity within the demigod domain.

But the Divine Sovereign Realm and the Divine Annihilation Realm... their power existed on completely different planes. If even the Grand Adjudicator reacted this way, one could imagine the reaction of the others.

"Hahahaha!" Dian Luohou burst out laughing. "What foolishness is this boy spouting?"

Dian Jiuzhi did not laugh, but his eyes were also filled with confusion and astonishment. He had personally witnessed Yun Che in action. He wouldn't have been too surprised if Yun Che, like Shen Wuyi, could overcome an opponent two minor realms above him. But he could not possibly believe he was qualified to face the power of the Divine Annihilation Realm, let alone an unsuppressed Dian Sansi.

"This... Brother Yuan, is he..." Meng Jianxi subconsciously turned to look at Meng Kongchan, only to find his father's face was a mask of eerie calm... and he even seemed to have exchanged a meaningful glance with Divine Master Hua Xin opposite him. Meng Jianxi fell silent, his gaze refocusing on the battlefield, all his senses concentrated on his sight... As his focus sharpened, the light around him and the sounds in his ears rapidly faded, leaving only the violent pounding of his own heart. Could it be... could he truly, at the Divine Sovereign Realm... match a Divine Annihilation Realm expert!?

"Is... is he serious??" Disbelief was written all over Cha Xing's face.

"It doesn't seem like a joke, and this situation doesn't allow for jokes," Xian Yue said, studying Yun Che's expression with a frown. He tried his best to figure out Yun Che's motive for saying such a thing, but he absolutely could not believe he could match Dian Sansi at this cultivation level... it would be impossible to withstand even a single exchange. Wu Shenxing and Wu Shenyue exchanged a look, their expressions subtle.

"Tch! What Perfect Godhead? Has he lost his mind?" Pan Buzhuo, the ugly scar still on his right cheek, sneered in a low voice.

Pan Yusheng, however, glanced at Meng Kongchan's expression and frowned slightly. The Grand Adjudicator closed his five fingers, and the Profound Desolation Seal dissipated.

"In that case, no Profound Desolation Seal will be applied. The battle begins! The rules are the same as for the Son of God Battle!"
