“Brother Yuan, there’s no need to be too shocked or concerned about the Evernight Goddess’s Divine Extinction Realm Level Six¹ cultivation. It’s very likely a rotten, empty shell,” Meng Jianxi² said softly, coming to Yun Che’s³ side.

Yun Che glanced sideways. “Why do you say that?”

Meng Jianxi said seriously, “I just focused on integrating some information about the Evernight Divine Kingdom⁴ from recent years. I found that they have been searching for and exchanging violent Abyss Crystals⁵, which possess immense energy but are extremely difficult to control.”

“Because the energy contained within these Abyss Crystals is too difficult to harness, they are almost impossible to use for aiding cultivation. Most are used as energy for forging or for offensive profound formations⁶.”

“Previously, I was slightly puzzled by the Evernight Divine Kingdom’s actions, but I didn’t pay much attention. But now that I think about it…”

His gaze indicated the direction of the Evernight Divine Kingdom. “Wuming Divine Venerable⁷ is an extremely deranged woman. Father God once said that what she sought by becoming a Divine Venerable was not to lead the Evernight Divine Kingdom, but to inflict hatred upon all men in the world… For this, she would stop at nothing, sparing no expense.”

“So…”

Yun Che roughly understood what he was going to say. “You mean…”

“Pulling up seedlings to help them grow⁸.”

Meng Jianxi’s eyes narrowed slightly, his tone laced with sarcasm. “The Xuanji Palace⁹ records that when Shen Wuyan Ye¹⁰ first became a Divine Venerable, in order to quickly raise the cultivation of the women in her clan, she once used divine power to create a cultivation profound formation that could stimulate profound veins¹¹ and profound orifices¹², thereby forcibly elevating their cultivation in a short period.”

“However, this profound formation was so fierce and violent that it could be called cruel. It violated the laws of the profound way¹³, and even harmed heavenly harmony. Although it could rapidly increase one’s cultivation in the short term, it would also cause permanent damage to the profound veins, thereby harming their lifespan and future. Therefore, this profound formation was later abandoned and prohibited by Wuming Divine Venerable.”

“According to the records, the formation base¹⁴ of this profound formation required precisely these various violent Abyss Crystals.”

“I understand.”

Yun Che nodded slightly, following his words. “To overtly suppress the Divine Children¹⁵ of other kingdoms, Wuming Divine Venerable would not hesitate to reactivate this profound formation, forcibly boosting Shen Wuyi’s¹⁶ cultivation to such an astonishing level… This is indeed highly probable.”

To other divine kingdoms, Divine Children and Divine Daughters¹⁷ were precious beyond measure, fearing even the slightest harm to them. But for Wuming Divine Venerable, if it meant surpassing the Divine Children and trampling on the dignity of all men from other divine kingdoms, she would absolutely do it. However, Yun Che spoke these words very calmly, without the slightest ripple of worry in his heart.

“It’s highly likely to be so.”

Meng Jianxi nodded slowly. “Unless the initial information about Shen Wuyi was entirely false, otherwise… I can’t think of any other possibility.”

To go from the peak of the Divine Master Realm¹⁸ to Divine Extinction Realm Level Six in just twenty years—not to mention this era, throughout the entire history of the Six Divine Kingdoms¹⁹, such a feat has never occurred.

Yun Che echoed with a nod, deeply agreeing. “Indeed, otherwise, it would defy all logic.”

Logic… But my Qingyue²⁰… she, like the Creation Gods²¹ and Devil Emperors²², was personally created by the Progenitor God²³. She was born from the most primordial, most fundamental power of nothingness. Her heart was like glazed glass, and her profound essence was exquisite. She was never within the realm of worldly cognition.

At this moment, a wisp of clear breeze swept past, instantly extinguishing all clamor. The world suddenly became incredibly quiet. Yun Che once again heard the sound of his own heartbeat, but this time it was exceptionally steady and peaceful. An indescribable sensation silently enveloped his spiritual perception²⁴, light and ethereal, seemingly present yet absent, like the gentle ripples of a clear spring or the faint mist of dawn. Yet, it caused everyone to instantly fall silent, their movements involuntarily becoming respectful and cautious, and all stirring thoughts settled into tranquility. It was as if any unusual sound, movement, or thought at this moment would be an unforgivable disrespect and blasphemy. Everyone’s gaze, as if drawn by an invisible force, turned towards the same direction. Pure clouds peeled away layer by layer, and a white figure slowly approached… Suddenly, Yun Che’s gaze became dazed, as if his consciousness briefly wandered. When it cleared, the figure was fully reflected in his sight.

His pupils contracted slightly, his gaze fixed for a long time.

All the Divine Venerables and Dragon Lords²⁵ stood upright. Even Wuming Divine Venerable, who was in her sedan chair²⁶, respectfully rose, then led the profound practitioners²⁷ of her divine kingdom to bow neatly and reverently. “Greetings, Abyss Emperor²⁸.”

Four incredibly brief words, a single, simple bow. There was no grand welcoming ceremony, no elaborate bowing ritual, no heaven-shaking proclamation, nor world-shining divine radiance. This was the etiquette for an audience with the Supreme Emperor of the Abyss; a single bow was sufficient.

Even in the most barren lands of the Abyss, the kings of the weakest nations would have far more pomp than this. The Abyss Emperor, the supreme ruler of the Abyss world, and moreover, the founder of the Abyss, was the ultimate existence revered by all beings of the Abyss for generations. To the creatures of the Abyss, his existence was like the heavenly light covering the firmament, symbolizing supreme power, status, authority, and majesty. Yet, only those who had personally met the Abyss Emperor knew that he never required elaborate rituals, nor did he possess any imperial majesty. There were no Abyss Knights²⁹ or Pure Land Divine Guards³⁰ forming ranks to clear the way, nor any announcement. The Abyss Emperor simply appeared directly before everyone.

The Abyss Emperor in Yun Che’s sight wore a plain white long robe, unstained by a speck of dust, as white as snow, flawlessly white, without any ornaments. The sash tied around his waist was also pure white without a trace of color. His wide sleeves fell naturally like flowing clouds, so pure and simple that it was hard to believe this was the attire of an emperor. A wisp of faint smoky cloud approached without fear, lingering greedily before the man, then reluctantly brushed past, revealing a handsome and elegant face carved from smooth, lustrous jade. His features were sculpted with a refinement and elegance that even women could not hope for. His eyebrows were like distant mountains painted with ink, and his long lashes cast shallow shadows beneath his eyes, yet they reflected not a hint of imperial majesty. It was him… indeed… it was him… This was Yun Che’s first face-to-face encounter with the Abyss Emperor, yet not his first time seeing him. For long before this, the Heretic God Ni Xuan³¹ had already informed him of the Abyss Emperor’s identity through memory fragments, and had given him an unspoken entrustment. Now, the figure in his sight completely shattered any other already tenuous possibilities. That name, which was also the name of the Abyss Emperor before him, surged chaotically in Yun Che’s soul sea³². The leader of the Four Creation Gods, the son of the Heaven Punishing Divine Emperor Mo’e³³… the Heaven Punishing Crown Prince³⁴ of the ancient divine race, who, according to records, was personally buried by Mo’e in the Abyss of Nothingness³⁵ and should have long perished in nothingness… Mo Su³⁶! His appearance was almost identical to that in Ni Xuan’s memories. Even after so many years, even if they were just faint memory fragments, he remained so clear and distinct in Ni Xuan’s lingering soul. Because this name, this figure, carried the regret and shame that Ni Xuan could not release even in death. But beyond his appearance, he had completely changed.

His eyes were as clear as a pure pond reflecting countless stars, and so gentle that they seemed capable of holding a pond full of starlight. Yet, there was no trace of his former confusion, yearning, or lively ripples. Faintly, a thin mist seemed to shroud his pupils, as if isolating something… Was it emotion, intention, or everything… He was Mo Su, the Heaven Punishing Crown Prince. No one in the vast God Realm³⁷ knew that in ancient times, in the era before the War of Gods and Devils³⁸ erupted, he did not perish after being personally buried by his Father God in the Abyss of Nothingness. Instead, he survived in the Abyss and founded the era of the Abyss. This led to the current Abyss world, and the current Six Divine Kingdoms. And for the original world, he created this terrifying and unparalleled danger.

“There’s no need for formalities, everyone.” He spoke faintly, his voice like the warm sun caressing snow, so gentle and warm that people unconsciously softened their breathing. Everyone complied, ceased their bows, and stood upright again, their heads slightly raised, facing the Emperor of the Abyss with reverence.

“Li Suo³⁹, do you still remember him?” Yun Che asked softly in his soul sea, calming his emotions.

Li Suo quickly responded, “The Heaven Punishing Crown Prince, Mo Su.”

“How much more can you recall about him?”

After a brief silence, she replied, “Only his appearance and name. All other knowledge comes from you.”
“He is the son of Mo’e, the successor of a Creation God. In ancient times, he already surpassed all gods. In this era, his body, his power, his divine soul⁴⁰, his cognition… everything about him transcends existing planes⁴¹. Is such a person truly someone you can contend with?”

“…”

Yun Che did not answer.

As everyone readjusted their stances, they realized that the Abyss Emperor had not arrived alone.
Behind him, three figures accompanied him on either side.

The foremost figure possessed a divine bearing that oppressed the soul, his might like the firmament. It was precisely the Grand Divine Official⁴² whom Yun Che had just met. Behind him closely followed a person whose demeanor was extremely similar to his. Yun Che knew without asking that this must be the Grand Divine Official’s personal divine attendant, and also the head of the Four Divine Attendants of the Pure Land⁴³—Dong Huang⁴⁴. The Spirit Immortal Divine Official’s⁴⁵ attendant, Su Shang⁴⁶, was as elegant as water, and the Six Smiles Divine Official’s⁴⁷ attendant, Yuan Ying⁴⁸, was playful and carefree, their temperaments similar to their masters… And this Grand Divine Official’s attendant was clearly the same; the cold and oppressive aura in his eyes almost chilled one’s soul and shattered one’s bones. The person accompanying on the other side wore silver armor, and even layers of pure clouds could not conceal its cold, brilliant light. His lips were pressed tightly together, his facial features like sword edges, and his eyes were as sharp as cold stars. A silver greatsword was strapped to his back, and his entire being seemed to be enveloped in a faint silver glow. In just an instant, he could unleash divine might capable of shattering stars. Yun Che immediately thought of one person. The number one ranked Abyss Knight, and also the commander-in-chief of all Abyss Knights in the Pure Land… Dugu Zhuyuan⁴⁹!

The Abyss Emperor floated in mid-air, his face like warm jade. He gazed forward, yet everyone clearly felt the Abyss Emperor’s gaze fixed upon themselves. Yun Che’s pupils suddenly trembled.

As the wide sleeve of the Abyss Emperor’s left arm slightly lifted, Yun Che’s gaze touched an exceptionally dazzling black color amidst the pure white. It seemed to be a jade bracelet, its material difficult to discern, black as the darkest night, yet dull and lusterless.

But the moment Yun Che’s eyes touched it, both his heart and soul strings⁵⁰ twitched violently. Within his profound veins, the Darkness Eternal Tribulation⁵¹ stirred with an instant of abnormal ripples. However, it was only for an instant, and then everything returned to calm.

As if everything was merely a fleeting illusion.
